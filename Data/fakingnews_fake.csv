Their new game will feature Ravi Shankar Prasad’s face on the bird’s face. The developers wanted the angriest face for their new edition.

After years and years of research and data, they found that Ravi Shankar’s face was apt for the game. They will obviously buy the copyrig=hts of his image before launching the new game.

When Ravi Shankar was told about this happening by his team, he became very angry and his angry face was captured by his team and sent to the Rovio labs. It was found that Ravi Shankar Ji has broken his own record in becoming angry. Rovio has finalized the image and the game will launch in the early part of 2020.

Ravi Shankar will get a free subscription to the game for his lifetime. There are rumors that the manufacturers of the Temple Run game will try to get the face of Rahul Gandhi for the character after being impressed by the way Rahul ran from temple to temple in lead up to the 2019 elections.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ravi-shankar-prasad-anger-716x403.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/new-angry-birds-game-ravi-shankar-prasads-face-birds-31839,New Angry birds game to have Ravi Shankar Prasad's face on birds,,1574677527.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/95-hotel-reviews-maharashtra-written-mlas-last-2-weeks-faking-survey-31835,"Mumbai. Maharashtra politics has been taking interesting turns in the last 2-3 weeks. It is not at all surprising that 95 % of hotel reviews in Maharashtra are written by the MLAs and not general tourists. MLAs from all parties have been staying at hotels and traveling from one hotel to another.

In their free time, they have become full-time hotel reviewers. In fact, the words and phrases that they use are so difficult even for a normal reviewer to use.

Faking News survey found that all sophisticated reviews are written by the MLAs so that they get even better service when they return to the hotel after the next election. It is becoming a norm in India that after an election, the MLA or MP goes straight to a hotel or a chartered flight. BJP MLAs were so scared of Amit Shah’s visit to Mumbai that they also chose a hotel to hide, it was only later did they realize that Amit Shah is coming to buy the NCP MLAs and not the BJP MLAs.

The hotel business in Maharashtra alone is growing by 30% and it will increase even further if the government is not formed quickly. Hotels are offering MLA suites to all parties where any opposition Leader cannot reach you on phone or email.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-20-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/95-hotel-reviews-maharashtra-written-mlas-last-2-weeks-faking-survey-31835,95% hotel reviews in Maharashtra have been written by MLAs in last 2 weeks: Faking Survey,,1574657680.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Maharashtra politics is in deep trouble as no party is willing to form the government or showing urgency in giving a government to the voters. Fadnavis finally agreed to give the CM seat to Shiv Sena in order to keep ruling over Maharashtra.

But Sanjay Raut picked up the phone, said “CM will be from Sena” and put down the phone. Sanjay Raut did not even listen to what Fadnavis was saying.

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said his party will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the leadership of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on the issue of farmers.

Faking News spoke to Raut Ji and he said: “CM will be from Sena”. We even emailed him some questions to which he replied: “CM will be from Sena”. Even the Whatsapp status of Sanjay Raut is “CM will be from Sena”.

Devendra Fadnavis is confused as to how he should speak to Sanjay as Sanjay is busy saying the same sentence again and again. There are also chances that the BJP and NCP will come together to form an alliance and remove Sena completely from the power equation.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-19.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fadnavis-calls-raut-give-cm-seat-sena-raut-picks-call-says-cm-will-sena-puts-phone-31788,"Fadnavis calls Raut to give CM seat to Sena; Raut picks up call, says “CM will be from Sena” and puts down the phone",,1574160609.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ani-reporter-sanjay-raut-become-business-partners-developing-strong-friendship-past-month-31739,"Mumbai: For the past month, Sanjay Raut has been giving running commentary on Maharashtra politics amplified by ANI’s coverage. One ANI reporter has been following Mr. Raut around all this time covering every utterance as breaking news. Having spent all this time together, both of them have developed a very strong friendship, and have decided to start a media business together.

Ever since Maharashtra election verdict came out, giving a clear majority to NDA alliance, resulting in a hung assembly, Sanjay Raut has been following a fixed routine. Early morning, a copied couplet from some poem, then demanding the CM post for Shiv Sena, then claiming he has support of 10000 MLAs, then taking a dig at BJP, then claiming the CM will be from Shiv Sena, then meeting everyone in Congress and NCP, then claiming CM will be from Shiv Sena, and during all this time, the ANI reporter follows him all around and provides us the live updates. A friendship was bound to develop when two people spend so much time in close proximity and now a media business venture is following it.

Speaking to Faking News, the ANI reporter (whose name has been hidden to avoid people judging his reportage over his political links) said ,” There was some concern that a journalist shouldn’t enter into a business venture with a politician since this will make people judge the quality of my reports but with Mr. Sanjay Raut, there should not be any such concern. Everyone knows he is going to attack BJP and claim next CM will be from Shiv Sena. There is nothing I can change in that after becoming his business partner.”

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Governor is down to inviting independents to form a government after none of the major political parties managed to show support of 145 MLAs required to prove majority.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-14.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ani-reporter-sanjay-raut-become-business-partners-developing-strong-friendship-past-month-31739,ANI reporter and Sanjay Raut become business partners after developing a strong friendship during past month,,1573641625.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Maharashtra government formation is nothing short of an Ekta Kapoor drama. It has emotions, backstabbing, nostalgia, love and hate, and plenty of drama. Shiv Sena has asked for more time to form the government as Doordarshan has just released the election results today and now the real discussion about the formation will start.

Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has reportedly recommended President’s Rule in the state. Koshyari had given time to the NCP till 8.30 pm today to prove that it has the numbers after the Shiv Sena on Monday failed to get letters. Doordarshan declared the election results today morning and BJP won the maximum seats to become the single largest party. Shiv Sena with 56 seats is the second largest party and Uddhav Thackeray wants 20 days time to decide on government formation.

According to him, Doordarshan is the most reliable news source and timings of Doordrashan should be given importance. Though the private channels had declared the election results 2 weeks back, Uddhav says that Indian news channels like Doordarshan should be given the priority as other channels have foreign fundings. As the government formation is not looking as easy as it seemed, even the BJP agreed with Uddhav’s comments and asked the government to go by the Doordarshan timings.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-9.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/doordarshan-just-declared-maharashtra-election-results-today-give-us-time-govt-formation-shiv-sena-31732,"Doordarshan has just declared the Maharashtra election results today, give us time for govt formation: Shiv Sena",,1573551104.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Shiv Sena is in the closing stages of making a deal with the Congress and NCP to form the government in Maharashtra. But BJP, as a last resort has agreed to do something they have never done before. They have agreed to share their Netflix password to keep Shiv Sena away from Congress-NCP.

Sharing the Netflix password is the epitome of convincing someone or showing friendship for someone. For many years it was sharing the last piece of Pizza, but in this digital world, Netflix password has taken that place.

On Sunday, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP agreed to come together with the Sena on the condition that the latter cut ties with BJP, quit NDA and evolve a common minimum programme. Shiv Sena had asked for the Netflix credentials in their last meeting with BJP but Devendra Fadnavis did not agree. Now that Amit Shah had a meeting with Devendra, the BJP unit of Maharashtra has agreed to share the credentials.

Faking News spoke to Devendra Fadnavis and he had this to say, “ I know it is a tough moment for us, but we had to do this for the people of Maharashtra. We will share the password for only 5 years, after which Shiv Sena will have to buy their own premium account of Netflix.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-5.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-agrees-share-netflix-password-last-resort-keep-shiv-sena-away-congress-ncp-31723,BJP agrees to share Netflix password as a last resort to keep Shiv Sena away from Congress-NCP,,1573468581.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sources reveal that the Saamna Editor has formed a Whatsapp group with senior members of both Congress and NCP with Aditya Thackeray as the Group Admin. Not surpsingly, BJP leaders were kept away from the group.

The Whatsapp group is seen as an attempt to show the Sena’s strength to the BJP. “We don’t need them because we have the numbers on Whatsapp. Adityaji has taken the oath of being the Group Admin and will be serving in this position for 5 years,” said Mr. Raut while speaking to our reporter.

Though Sainiks were ecstatic with the announcement, leaders of the Congress party who were part of the group were not sure if the exercise was needed.

A Senior leader, under the condition of anonymity, spoke to our reporter and said, “Don’t know what’s gone into Sanjay Raut. I am part of that group too. Other than Good Morning messages and memes, there is hardly any conversation in the group. The BJP won’t even flinch. Our respected madam has already left the group and many members will follow suit.”

A few days back Supreme Court had given a stern warning to Sanjay Raut asking him to stay quiet and let leaders of Shiv Sena and BJP decide on Govt formation. His latest Whatsapp stunt, as per legal experts, could appear as contempt of court

Congress performed well in both the state elections recently and what worked in their favor is Rahul Gandhi’s absence from the campaign rallies. Surjewala has taken this feedback seriously and has organized an urgent meeting to plan Rahul Gandhi’s next visit before he returns from is a current vacation.

As reports of Rahul Gandhi skipping Congress’s week-long protests against the Centre started coming in, the party scrambled to defend the leader saying he has left for a meditational tour. BJP leaders were seen commenting about why an abroad location was selected for the same and the reason was that they want Rahul Gandhi here in India all the time to help BJP. But Surjewala is smart enough to predict BJP’s game plan, and so he did not waste time in planning Rahul’s next vacation.

Surjewala spoke to Faking News and had this to say, “He has been to many countries, but still, there are places which he should visit next. We are working in tandem with Imtiaz Ali to decide which place would be far enough to visit so that Congress recovers by the time he is back here. Thailand, Italy, the US, and other places were good but Rahul Ji needs some more time off. So a long vacation has to be planned soon”

The BJP in Maharashtra on Monday said it has the support of 15 Independent MLAs and asserted the party will “comfortably” form the next government taking the Shiv Sena along with it.

The BJP’s assertion comes amid the Shiv Sena’s demand for an equal share in power and the two saffron parties occupying the chief minister’s post on a rotational basis. But Shiv Sena is currently disagreeing with everything that the BJP says. Today was the heights of such type of disagreement, as BJP praised Aditya Thackeray for his work done for the youth, Shiv Sena disagreed and called Aditya a product of nepotism.

Sanjay Raut, the Shiv Sena MP has said that his party will not agree with BJP at any cost as that will be an insult to the 50:50 formula suggested by Amit Shah himself. BJP meanwhile has a new plan. It will announce in a press conference that Shiv Sena has decided to not form the government in Maharashtra with BJP, and Shiv Sena out of the sheer habit will come out in open and say that they will indeed form the government with BJP.

Faking News Reporter spoke to Sanjay Raut and he had this to say, “Our policy is simple, we cannot agree with anyone. In fact, there are disagreements among my own party members. We believe that dissent is an important part of democracy. And Shiv Sainiks will always disagree with everyone.”

The suspense regarding Haryana government formation is still intact and we don’t yet know who will form the government. But going by what Surjewala said in his press conference, it seems like it is a planned strategy of the BJP. According to Surjewala, even the loss in Haryana elections is actually a win for the BJP.

Surjewala held a press conference today morning just as the results were coming in. He said, “Even we were surprised by the Haryana results. We were expecting 5 seats in Haryana but are actually getting 31 seats. This is shocking. But after thorough analysis, we have arrived upon the conclusion that BJP lost it deliberately so that they can then spend money to buy MLAs and prove that there is no economic slowdown in the country. Mark my words, Ravi Shankar ji will give you the logic in few days. The money spent will be so huge that people will be brainwashed in believing that eonomy is in good state.”

And Republic TV held a big debate to discuss the exit polls.

The number of panelists was way more than the total number of people working in the media house. Some of the panelists were not visible in a TV set smaller than 32’ and so Republic TV management has requested the government to make 32’ as the minimum requirement for a TV.

Anyone found watching a TV that is less than 32’, than that person should be fined. This will be a major setback for the panwalas or the small retail shops who still use the smaller TVs, but Republic TV has promised that it will tie up with TV manufacturers and try to offer cashback or discounts to the new customers who buy the TVs to watch debates on republic TV.

There were speculations that the singer is all set to join the ruling BJP, which were later put to rest by Amit Shah.

While speaking to reporters, Home Minister Amit Shah said, “Media ke madhyam se mai batana chahta hu ki ye jo Lady Ghagra..Ganga..ya jo bhi unka naam hai, who BJP mein shaamil nai ho rahi. These are just rumors and if there is any induction into the party you will know about it through official channels.”

But by the time the clarification came, the damage was already done. A news channel even carried a report that Lady Gaga could arrive in Mumbai on Election Day to show her support for Shiv Sena BJP alliance.

Even Aditya Thackeray got caught up and almost reached the airport with a bouquet to welcome her. Gaga’s PR too had to issue a clarification to cool things down.

Congress party however was not too pleased with the award winning singer tweeting in Sanskrit. that too on the eve of elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. Congress leaders on previous occasion criticized the BJP for promoting Sanskrit as India’s official language.

Some were of the opinion that the saffron party was using Lady Gaga’s star power to push their Sanskrit agenda. Senior Congress leaders were critical of the singer and urged her stay away from Indian politics.

“Why a Sanskrit shloka. What is she trying to say. Many of the fans are impressionable first time voters and can get influenced to vote for BJP-Shiv Sena,” questioned an opposition leader.

In fact, Amit Shah ignored it completely and on being asked what are his views on the big actor visiting JNU, he said that he has not seen Taimur in JNU or anywhere near to Delhi. This implies that Amit Shah considers Taimur as a bigger star than Deepika and other actors who have been protesting against the government.

Big actors like Amitabh, SRK, Salman, and Taimur have not uttered a word on the JNU attack, and that makes the home minister feel safe about his government. According to him, these are the 4 biggest stars based on popularity and income tax payments.

His father Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke against the CAA and called for a nationwide protest for the bill.

The only problem though was that people at the rally did not understand what Mulayam said, as is the case with most of his speeches. Even Akhilesh also did not get a single word and thought that his father is actually speaking in favor of the CAA. As the speech went on, more and more people left the rally and started supporting CAA. The number of people on the UP streets who are supporting CAA has increased drastically after Mulayam’s speech.

The opposition is very worried and has asked people like Mulayam Singh and Sharad Pawar to not speak anything on the CAA as it may have a negative influence on the anti-CAA campaign.

The only problem though was that people at the rally did not understand what Mulayam said, as is the case with most of his speeches.

As the speech went on, more and more people left the rally and started supporting CAA. The number of people on the UP streets who are supporting CAA has increased drastically after Mulayam’s speech.

The opposition is very worried and has asked people like Mulayam Singh and Sharad Pawar to not speak anything on the CAA as it may have a negative influence on the anti-CAA campaign.

The only problem though was that people at the rally did not understand what Mulayam said, as is the case with most of his speeches. Even Akhilesh also did not get a single word and thought that his father is actually speaking in favor of the CAA. As the speech went on, more and more people left the rally and started supporting CAA. The number of people on the UP streets who are supporting CAA has increased drastically after Mulayam’s speech.

The opposition is very worried and has asked people like Mulayam Singh and Sharad Pawar to not speak anything on the CAA as it may have a negative influence on the anti-CAA campaign.

Akhilesh has asked his team to type the whole speech of Mulayam Singh and publish in newspapers for people to know what Mulayam actually spoke. But the big question mark is whether Akhilesh’s team has understood what Mulayam spoke?",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Former-Samajwadi-Party-SP-chief-and-former-Uttar-Pradesh-chief-minister-Mulayam-Singh-Yadav-with-Akhilesh-Yadav-770x433.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/people-not-understand-mulayam-singhs-language-start-supporting-caa-anti-caa-speech-32197,People who did not understand Mulayam Singh’s language start supporting CAA after his anti-CAA speech,,1577684300.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

His father Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke against the CAA and called for a nationwide protest for the bill.

The only problem though was that people at the rally did not understand what Mulayam said, as is the case with most of his speeches. Even Akhilesh also did not get a single word and thought that his father is actually speaking in favor of the CAA. As the speech went on, more and more people left the rally and started supporting CAA. The number of people on the UP streets who are supporting CAA has increased drastically after Mulayam’s speech.

The opposition is very worried and has asked people like Mulayam Singh and Sharad Pawar to not speak anything on the CAA as it may have a negative influence on the anti-CAA campaign.

Akhilesh has asked his team to type the whole speech of Mulayam Singh and publish in newspapers for people to know what Mulayam actually spoke.

Big actors like Amitabh, SRK, Salman, and Taimur have not uttered a word on the JNU attack, and that makes the home minister feel safe about his government. According to him, these are the 4 biggest stars based on popularity and income tax payments.

Alleging that the BJP government was afraid of Hindu-Muslim unity, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday sought to know when a probe into “police brutality” during a widespread protest in the state against Citizenship Amendment Act will be ordered. His father Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke against the CAA and called for a nationwide protest for the bill.

The only problem though was that people at the rally did not understand what Mulayam said, as is the case with most of his speeches. Even Akhilesh also did not get a single word and thought that his father is actually speaking in favor of the CAA. As the speech went on, more and more people left the rally and started supporting CAA. The number of people on the UP streets who are supporting CAA has increased drastically after Mulayam’s speech.

The opposition is very worried and has asked people like Mulayam Singh and Sharad Pawar to not speak anything on the CAA as it may have a negative influence on the anti-CAA campaign.

Akhilesh has asked his team to type the whole speech of Mulayam Singh and publish in newspapers for people to know what Mulayam actually spoke. But the big question mark is whether Akhilesh’s team has understood what Mulayam spoke?",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Former-Samajwadi-Party-SP-chief-and-former-Uttar-Pradesh-chief-minister-Mulayam-Singh-Yadav-with-Akhilesh-Yadav-770x433.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/people-not-understand-mulayam-singhs-language-start-supporting-caa-anti-caa-speech-32197,People who did not understand Mulayam Singh’s language start supporting CAA after his anti-CAA speech,,1577684300.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Shiv Sena workers have identified more such people and their heads will be shaved in the next couple of days. The number of orders in increasing and people who want a free head shave are just making a derogatory or an objectionable post on Uddhav Thackeray. There were many areas in Mumbai where the saloons remained closed.

People are demanding the Shiv Sena workers should also offer head massage, hair-cutting, face shave, and other services so that they don’t have to visit the salon and pay heavily.

The Jharkhand BJP leaders were confident that the voters will vote for the party as they thought people do support CAA and NRC here. But the result was totally different. Some BJP leaders lost by huge margins and they felt persecuted by the voters. The leaders took this opportunity to speak about the importance of NRC and CAA. They told in the press conference that now that they are persecuted, they will be given citizenship by the Indian government.

But a senior reporter stood up and told them that they already have citizenship and should not worry about it anymore.

Smriti Irani has used the whole day in parliament to ask for an apology for different reasons. Her latest demand includes Rahul Gandhi to apologize for not apologizing.

The BJP on Friday launched a blistering attack in the Lok Sabha on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his ‘Rape in India’ remarks and sought his apology for disrespecting women of the country. Rahul Gandhi did not apologize after Smriti Irani’s demands. Smriti who has an experience of working in Ekta Kapoor serials asked RaGa to apologize thrice by making a dramatic face which RaGa was not comfortable with. Without wasting any time, Smiriti Irani asked Rahul for another apology.

This takes the total number of apologies demanded in Parliament to 543. Basically every MP has asked for an apology from another MP.

According to our sources, the grand old party was struggling to allocate budget for the dinner Rahul Gandhi is planning to host on May 23rd for its newly elected MPs. With Aiyar Ji’s comment which came on top of Sam Pitroda ji’s series of comments, party treasurer is hoping the number of newly elected MPs would be significantly lower than what he had factored a week back.

“Already there are close to thousand people in the party jo election contest karte nahin hai, they just hang around Sonia JI, Priyanka Ji and Rahul Ji to get free dinner like these. I told Rahul Ji we can not afford more than 50 elected MPs for the dinner, we have to do something and do it fast”, said Nathulal Vora, treasurer of the party.

According to Vora, Party had a tough time because Digvijay Singh Ji who has bayanbazi skill to reduce elected representatives’ headcount is currently busy with his own election. “Sam Pitroda Ji tried hard, but still he is a newcomer to Indian politics, and he apologizes for his statements far too quickly. Then we remembered Mani Shankar Aiyar Ji, tried and tested who has done enough for the party’s fund management over the years by limiting its growth”.

Vora regrets how party forgot about a legend like Aiyar Ji for six phases of election. “I personally sent him an apology and he replied back with a smiley, asking me is it enough or something more party expects him to do?”

“Still 118 seats left for us, more than three times of seat we won in 2014. So, there is a long way to go before country decides who will rule India for next five years”, said Rajeev Shukla of Congress. “Our elections are a game of uncertainties like cricket.

The Congress-AAP alliance which was seen very likely in the 2019 elections in Delhi never really materialized and that left Kejriwal stranded with no partners in the election. He tried hard to convince Rahul Gandhi and senior members of the Congress party but all in vain.

But after his repeated efforts to string together a coalition Congress ne lagbhag mana kar diya. But he is ready with his plan B. He is pretty sure that come 2019, Raihan Vadra or Miraya Vadra would be the president of the Congress party and it makes sense to discuss the opportunities for a coalition with them right now so that they can get convinced in the next 10 years.

This has caused a great panic in the country with people starting guess work about what the announcement could be. Any major announcements in the last 2 years have resulted in people panicking and taking measures to lessen the impact on their lives. Be it GST, Demonetization or any new Cess added to the current taxes. The most bizarre story which Faking News got today is a man demanding dowry to be paid in 1 Rupee coins as he fears that Jaitley may demonetize higher denomination notes.

The story is of Shwetank Srivastava, who has been always concerned about the financial decisions made by the current government. And like many old fashioned Indians, he is also a strong believer in the practice of dowry. So when his Son’s marriage proposal went as per plan, he took a lot of time in cracking up a good dowry deal with the girl’s parents. And today was the day he was to receive the full amount as agreed upon.

Once such idea is the Chowkidaar campaign from BJP which showcases Narendra Modi and his ministers as the protectors of the country.

Everyone from PM and BJP President to various ministers and even online supporters have added the prefix Chowkidaar to their names. Now with everyone becoming a Chowkidaar, one senior politician has seen this as an opportunity to finally realise his goal of becoming the Prime Minister.

Speaking to the media after a long break, veteran politician LK Advani said, “I really appreciate this chowkidar campaign by my party and am really happy to see all of them becoming Chowkidaars. I have always encouraged youngsters in my party to follow their dreams and if they want to become Chowkidaar, then who am I to object. However, this creates a problem about the vacancy that will be left in the PM Office. Since I don’t want any youngster to skip the campaign, I am willing to sacrifice for the nation and the party and this campaign, and become the Prime Minister if BJP wins this election.”

“I have never held any ambition to become the Prime Minister, but since the situation is such that no senior leader is available, I have to accept my destiny and wake up at least once in 7, Lok Kalyan Marg”, Mr. Advani said.

When asked what if the BJP doesn’t win the election, Mr. Advani said,” Fir ye sab ke sab Chowkidaar banne ke hi laayak hain.”",,https://web.archive.org/web/20190323130606im_/http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/advani.jpg,,,https://web.archive.org/web/20190323130606/http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/since-everyone-else-chowkidaar-will-sacrifice-accepting-pm-post-lk-advani-29393,"Since everyone else is a ‘Chowkidaar’, I will sacrifice by accepting the PM post: LK Advani",,1553232263.0,https://web.archive.org,

CSK supporters are one of the most loyal in India and the EC is pretty sure that this year the voter turnout will be the largest from all the previous years.

The scheduling of the practice session will be done in such a way that all polling booths are covered and there are nets nearby all the voting booths.

Finance Minister Ms Nirmala Sitharaman has played down the concerns over the rising prices by explaining that it is just a supply-demand issue and the price rise is due to an increase in demand across the country.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Ms Sitharaman said that the millennials are moving away from traditional Indian meals like Aloo Parantha towards healthy diets like a salad, spiking the demand in the market.

As we all know that onion is an essential part of an Indian salad, the demand has outstripped the supply causing the hike in prices.

Adding to the Minister’s comment, a senior official from Finance Ministry said, ”Earlier consumption of salad was limited to the time of the meal, as an accompaniment but now you see, they are consuming salads at every occasion, as breakfast, as snack, as dinner, and of course even as chakhna with alcohol. What did you expect, of course the prices will rise.”

Abhishek Rai, the leader Congress leader who shares his birthday with Modi, has been given one week to explain, failing which he will be expelled from the party.

As per sources, Rahul Gandhi himself caught Abhishek cutting a cake during his visit to Baran, Rajasthan. When the Congress Vice President asked why he was cutting a cake on Narendra Modi’s birthday, Abhishek said that it was his birthday as well.

Rahul Gandhi warned party workers against following the footsteps of Narendra Modi

The explanation failed to satisfy Mr. Gandhi and he issued a show cause notice to Abhishek asking him to explain his actions in detail.

When Faking News contacted Abhishek for his reactions, he said, “Arey yaar, what can I do about my date of birth? I played no part in it, it was my father and mother’s doing. Maybe I will stop celebrating my birthday from next year if it hurts anybody’s sentiments.”

Sources claim that Abhishek plans to go to high command wearing a skullcap and sporting a tilak on the forehead while asking for an apology. However, experts are not convinced that it will work.

One political expert speaking to Faking News said, “Skullcaps and Tilaks are used to fool the masses, not the politicians.”

Experts suggest the beleaguered leader to try other options that are feasible and practical.

“Maybe he could bribe authorities and get his date of birth changed,” an expert suggested, “Or he should declare that he is unborn, as was done by this guy in this Faking News report.”

“Or here it a solution that will definitely work,” the expert added, “This leader should declare his parents as RSS workers, who gave him a bad date of birth.”

Sources confirm that the parents of Abhishek Rai were not RSS workers. In fact, they were committed Congress workers.

While commenting on this, Mr. Abhishek Sibal, a close friend of the former FM said, “Mr. Chidambaram could not see the struggle CBI officials were facing while filing their IT return. Being a FM for so many years, he knows very well what to fill like being a senior lawyer he knows how to evade the long hands of the law”.

It is so comfortable and looks good on me too. But why hasn’t any world leader sent any compliments. Don’t I look handsome?” he asked, with a hint of emotion in his voice.

Sources say that Rahul was so upset that he locked himself in a room and stood in front of the mirror for hours looking at his reflection. Apparently, he even threatened to give up kurta-pyjama and wear a sporty shirt-trouser-sneaker combination if no compliments came his way.

However prominent leaders from the Mahagatbandhan advised him against doing so fearing that it would dent the image and hurt any chances or defeating Modi in 2019.

Congress leader Kamal Nath, whiom Rahul had addressed as someone with good looks and experience, was seen having an intense discussion with Rahul Gandhi over giving up of Kurta-Pyjama.

Even online retailers like Flipkart and Amazon are reporting very low numbers amid this waiting game played by the consumers. With 2019 elections on the horizon, people are staying away from buying Consumer durables as they are sure that political parties will provide them for free in exchange of votes next year.

Mostly electronics items like TV, Fridge, Washing Machine, Juicer-Mixer-Grinder are given free of cost to people during assembly elections but due to the high stakes in 2019 elections, political pundits believe that all these things will be given for free to everyone during Lok Sabha elections as well.

Speaking to Faking News, a leading retailer from Mumbai said,” We were expecting huge rush on the day we announced our Sale but I noticed that only a few people came in. Initially I thought PM Modi has announced another demonetization so I went and checked the ATM nearby but there were only 2 people there as well. Then I checked for any auto-taxi strike but even that was not the case. Then I spoke to some other retailers in the area and everyone reported the same problem. Finally, we did door to door survey in our area and came to know that people are just not buying any electronics item as they are certain to get it for free in just 6 months’ time.”

While answering a question in a TV interview, Mr. Chidambaram said, “This time around we wont make the same mistake that we did in 2014. Our purpose is to defeat BJP and Rahul as the PM face of our party has always proved to be counterproductive.”

Rahul Gandhi too wasn’t too keen on projecting himself as PM either. Insiders say other than getting to travel across the world, there is nothing that Rahul found interesting in the PM’s post. And he has always expressed a desire to move away from active politics.

This piece of information is giving the ruling party sleepless nights. “Looking at the way Rahul was campaigning, we were sure that 2019 would be a piece of cake. But if he is not the face of PM candidate then it would seriously affect out chances on winning the elections,” said a senior party worker.

Sources say that PM Modi and Amit Shah along with the top brass of the party were in a closed door meeting to discuss the upcoming election strategy after Congress party’s masterstroke slapped them across the face.

Amit Shah is expected to meet Rahul Gandhi later this week in a effort to coax him to project himself as the PM’s face. “Our election campaign is solely dependent on Rahulji.

A spurt in dollar demand from importers amid sustained foreign fund outflows also weighed on the rupee. The Finance Ministry has said that they are working overtime to ensure that the Rupee comes back to the average level which is acceptable to the economy.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley during the Google launch a Tez app in New Delhi on Monday. Express Photo by Prem Nath Pandey. 18.09.2017.

On the allegations that the Dollar has totally overshadowed and molested the Rupee in the recent times, the ministry said that Dollar will find a way to Atone itself for all the alleged actions against the Indian Rupee. In fact, ‘Atone’ and ‘Alleged Actions’ are the favorite words used by people to support any movement nowadays. Farah Khan and Farhan Akhtar used it recently to condemn the Sexual Harassment case against Sajid Khan and many others in the industry as part of the #MeToo movement going on in India.

The Finance ministry led by Arun Jaitley is pretty sure that Dollar will suffer because of the ill-treatment it meted out to the Rupee and whole India is in support with the Rupee right now. On being asked what are the steps his government is taking in this regard, Arun Jaitley said that” The government can’t do anything in this regard and the cycle will take its own due course.

The beating up of North Indians was something new in the state of Gujarat as many migrants work there for years. But now that the violence has happened, MNS, a prominent party in Maharashtra has filed for the patent as they think that ‘beating up north Indians’ is their invention.

MNS will submit proofs in form of photos and videos to the court to prove that they have beaten more north Indians than entire India including Gujarat. Raj Thackeray has asked all his members to increase the violence and defeat Gujarat in this race to become anti-north Indians. According to Raj and his associates, MNS has been beating up North Indians since last 10 years, and Gujarat has just bluntly copied the model without paying any royalty.

Raj Thackeray also believes that it’s not only about the beating up of people, but its also about how well you beat, and what measures you take to make sure that the person and his/her family doesn’t return to the state. The matter is pending with the patent commission to make a decision to whether grant the so-called patent to MNS or not.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10mns2.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mns-file-patent-beating-north-indians-gujarat-copies-model-27863,MNS to file Patent for 'Beating up North Indians' after Gujarat copies the model,,1539325694.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

However, a few days back Amit Shah was quite confident of winning at least 22 seats in WB and had been very vocal about it too. What changed?

Political experts and psephologist believe that Amit Shah has lost the confidence of winning seats only because Bangladesh gave a close fight to India in the recent Asia Cup final.

“There are many Bangladeshis in West Bengal who now have voting rights too and they are not likely to go with BJP since it is too nationalist.

Earlier, during Gujarat elections, Mr. Surjewala had revealed that Rahul Gandhi is a janeudhaari Brahmin and a couple of days back he had revealed Brahmin DNA of Congress.

Explaining the decision to enter this line, Mr. Surjewala said, “First of all this will show everyone what a knowledgeable janeudhaari brahmin Rahul Ji is, secondly it will shut those people up who say Rahul Ji hasn’t worked a day in his life. Thirdly, it will increase Rahul Ji’s connection with the people, he will be personally in touch with all the people who will come to attend the katha.”

“Currently he will be doing the katha only in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh because elections are there he is already scheduled to be there to strengthen party base. Anyone from those states can book an appointment via our party website. However, in 2019 we will be accepting bookings from all over the country. The money collected through this service will be given to the lawyers fighting National Herald case party fund,” Mr. Surjewala added.

As petrol prices crossed 86 Rs mark in Mumbai, Mr. Patra congratulated PM Modi for his hard work towards ensuring safe roads for the Indians. As per Mr. Patra, high petrol prices are keeping hooligans off the roads, making them safer for everyone else.

Speaking at a Press Conference squeezed in his busy schedule of news debates, Mr. Patra said, “A lot of misguided youngsters spend all their time roaming around on their bikes, doing awaragardi, creating ruckus, disrupting traffic, wasting their valuable time instead of studying or looking for a job. Now with increased petrol prices, they just can’t do those things freely any more, they have to worry about the cost of petrol at all times.”

“This has made our roads safer, reduced traffic on the road as people now go out only when they absolutely have to, reduced accidents, even Mumbai roads are starting to look like wide 1 laned highways as people stay away from the roads thanks to the cost of going out in your own vehicle. In fact, I hope our government works harder to ensure petrol reaches new heights every day. This is all a vision of our beloved PM Modi,” Mr. Patra added.

When asked if the government is planning to reduce some of the taxes on petrol to reduce its prices, an irritated Patra said, “I am talking about taking Petrol to new heights and you want to pull it down? And as far as reducing taxes is concerned, aren’t you aware that Mr. Jaitley is back in Finance Ministry?

Max Hospital has been accused of marking up their treatment cost so much that it is almost impossible for a common man to get treatment there. But one can expect at least the VIPs or the political class to be able to afford such treatment. But we were proved wrong yesterday when Laloo Prasad too fainted hearing the cost of treatment and declared himself fit.

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad yesterday surrendered before a CBI court in Ranchi. The Jharkhand High Court had earlier on August 24 rejected Lalu’s bail extension-plea and asked the RJD chief surrender by August 30. But he will be moved to a Ranchi hospital tomorrow which made the court to think that maybe Laloo Prasad is faking illness. So the judge gave orders of Laloo to be shifted to Max hospital in Delhi, whose cost of treatment is world famous.

Recently there was a rumor that a guy walking near the Max Hospital front gate sneezed there and the hospital gave him a bill of 2 lac Rupees.

Sources say that Rahul was so upset that he locked himself in a room and stood in front of the mirror for hours looking at his reflection. Apparently, he even threatened to give up kurta-pyjama and wear a sporty shirt-trouser-sneaker combination if no compliments came his way.

However prominent leaders from the Mahagatbandhan advised him against doing so fearing that it would dent the image and hurt any chances or defeating Modi in 2019.

Congress leader Kamal Nath, whiom Rahul had addressed as someone with good looks and experience, was seen having an intense discussion with Rahul Gandhi over giving up of Kurta-Pyjama.

“The Korean president may have seen our PM in the ‘Modi vest’. But has he seen our Rahulji in the shiny white Kurta. I am pretty he’d be bowled over by Rahul’s looks,” he said.

Insiders have revealed that the party is planning to dispatch a set of Kurta’s for all world leaders in a effort to make them aware of Rahul’s dressing sense. “Unlike Modiji, who appropriated the Nehru jacket, Rahulji’s style is unique. If it wasn’t for politics he could have been a very successful model,” said another Congress leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rajul-kurta.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kurta-pyjama-not-gorgeous-dont-look-handsome-wearing-emotional-rahul-questions-korean-president-28022,"Is my Kurta-Pyjama not gorgeous, don't I look handsome wearing it: emotional Rahul questions Korean President",,1541064663.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Even online retailers like Flipkart and Amazon are reporting very low numbers amid this waiting game played by the consumers. With 2019 elections on the horizon, people are staying away from buying Consumer durables as they are sure that political parties will provide them for free in exchange of votes next year.

Mostly electronics items like TV, Fridge, Washing Machine, Juicer-Mixer-Grinder are given free of cost to people during assembly elections but due to the high stakes in 2019 elections, political pundits believe that all these things will be given for free to everyone during Lok Sabha elections as well.

Speaking to Faking News, a leading retailer from Mumbai said,” We were expecting huge rush on the day we announced our Sale but I noticed that only a few people came in. Initially I thought PM Modi has announced another demonetization so I went and checked the ATM nearby but there were only 2 people there as well. Then I checked for any auto-taxi strike but even that was not the case. Then I spoke to some other retailers in the area and everyone reported the same problem. Finally, we did door to door survey in our area and came to know that people are just not buying any electronics item as they are certain to get it for free in just 6 months’ time.”

While answering a question in a TV interview, Mr. Chidambaram said, “This time around we wont make the same mistake that we did in 2014. Our purpose is to defeat BJP and Rahul as the PM face of our party has always proved to be counterproductive.”

Rahul Gandhi too wasn’t too keen on projecting himself as PM either. Insiders say other than getting to travel across the world, there is nothing that Rahul found interesting in the PM’s post. And he has always expressed a desire to move away from active politics.

This piece of information is giving the ruling party sleepless nights. “Looking at the way Rahul was campaigning, we were sure that 2019 would be a piece of cake. But if he is not the face of PM candidate then it would seriously affect out chances on winning the elections,” said a senior party worker.

Sources say that PM Modi and Amit Shah along with the top brass of the party were in a closed door meeting to discuss the upcoming election strategy after Congress party’s masterstroke slapped them across the face.

Amit Shah is expected to meet Rahul Gandhi later this week in a effort to coax him to project himself as the PM’s face. “Our election campaign is solely dependent on Rahulji.

A spurt in dollar demand from importers amid sustained foreign fund outflows also weighed on the rupee. The Finance Ministry has said that they are working overtime to ensure that the Rupee comes back to the average level which is acceptable to the economy.

On the allegations that the Dollar has totally overshadowed and molested the Rupee in the recent times, the ministry said that Dollar will find a way to Atone itself for all the alleged actions against the Indian Rupee. In fact, ‘Atone’ and ‘Alleged Actions’ are the favorite words used by people to support any movement nowadays. Farah Khan and Farhan Akhtar used it recently to condemn the Sexual Harassment case against Sajid Khan and many others in the industry as part of the #MeToo movement going on in India.

The Finance ministry led by Arun Jaitley is pretty sure that Dollar will suffer because of the ill-treatment it meted out to the Rupee and whole India is in support with the Rupee right now. On being asked what are the steps his government is taking in this regard, Arun Jaitley said that” The government can’t do anything in this regard and the cycle will take its own due course.

The beating up of North Indians was something new in the state of Gujarat as many migrants work there for years. But now that the violence has happened, MNS, a prominent party in Maharashtra has filed for the patent as they think that ‘beating up north Indians’ is their invention.

MNS will submit proofs in form of photos and videos to the court to prove that they have beaten more north Indians than entire India including Gujarat. Raj Thackeray has asked all his members to increase the violence and defeat Gujarat in this race to become anti-north Indians. According to Raj and his associates, MNS has been beating up North Indians since last 10 years, and Gujarat has just bluntly copied the model without paying any royalty.

Raj Thackeray also believes that it’s not only about the beating up of people, but its also about how well you beat, and what measures you take to make sure that the person and his/her family doesn’t return to the state.

Political experts and psephologist believe that Amit Shah has lost the confidence of winning seats only because Bangladesh gave a close fight to India in the recent Asia Cup final.

“There are many Bangladeshis in West Bengal who now have voting rights too and they are not likely to go with BJP since it is too nationalist. Bangladeshis becoming strong and competitive clearly shows that the fight for BJP wouldn’t be as easy as the BJP president was thinking earlier,” said the political expert Pravin Patil.

Earlier, during Gujarat elections, Mr. Surjewala had revealed that Rahul Gandhi is a janeudhaari Brahmin and a couple of days back he had revealed Brahmin DNA of Congress.

Explaining the decision to enter this line, Mr. Surjewala said, “First of all this will show everyone what a knowledgeable janeudhaari brahmin Rahul Ji is, secondly it will shut those people up who say Rahul Ji hasn’t worked a day in his life. Thirdly, it will increase Rahul Ji’s connection with the people, he will be personally in touch with all the people who will come to attend the katha.”

“Currently he will be doing the katha only in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh because elections are there he is already scheduled to be there to strengthen party base. Anyone from those states can book an appointment via our party website. However, in 2019 we will be accepting bookings from all over the country. The money collected through this service will be given to the lawyers fighting National Herald case party fund,” Mr. Surjewala added.

As petrol prices crossed 86 Rs mark in Mumbai, Mr. Patra congratulated PM Modi for his hard work towards ensuring safe roads for the Indians. As per Mr. Patra, high petrol prices are keeping hooligans off the roads, making them safer for everyone else.

Speaking at a Press Conference squeezed in his busy schedule of news debates, Mr. Patra said, “A lot of misguided youngsters spend all their time roaming around on their bikes, doing awaragardi, creating ruckus, disrupting traffic, wasting their valuable time instead of studying or looking for a job. Now with increased petrol prices, they just can’t do those things freely any more, they have to worry about the cost of petrol at all times.”

“This has made our roads safer, reduced traffic on the road as people now go out only when they absolutely have to, reduced accidents, even Mumbai roads are starting to look like wide 1 laned highways as people stay away from the roads thanks to the cost of going out in your own vehicle. In fact, I hope our government works harder to ensure petrol reaches new heights every day. This is all a vision of our beloved PM Modi,” Mr. Patra added.

When asked if the government is planning to reduce some of the taxes on petrol to reduce its prices, an irritated Patra said, “I am talking about taking Petrol to new heights and you want to pull it down? And as far as reducing taxes is concerned, aren’t you aware that Mr. Jaitley is back in Finance Ministry?

Max Hospital has been accused of marking up their treatment cost so much that it is almost impossible for a common man to get treatment there. But one can expect at least the VIPs or the political class to be able to afford such treatment. But we were proved wrong yesterday when Laloo Prasad too fainted hearing the cost of treatment and declared himself fit.

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad yesterday surrendered before a CBI court in Ranchi. The Jharkhand High Court had earlier on August 24 rejected Lalu’s bail extension-plea and asked the RJD chief surrender by August 30. But he will be moved to a Ranchi hospital tomorrow which made the court to think that maybe Laloo Prasad is faking illness. So the judge gave orders of Laloo to be shifted to Max hospital in Delhi, whose cost of treatment is world famous.

Recently there was a rumor that a guy walking near the Max Hospital front gate sneezed there and the hospital gave him a bill of 2 lac Rupees. The cost of treating cough, cold and other simple illneses is as high as treating cancer in some other countries.

Experienced faster Hazare has asked the government to declare it as the designated place for all fasts unto death to be held in the capital from now on.

Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written a letter opposing any changes to the present complex as it will detract from Pandit Nehru’s legacy. Congress has been opposing any plans to change Teen Murti Bhavan but sources say they may agree to Anna Hazare’s proposal.

Speaking to the media at the site of a protest, Anna Hazare said, “What Delhi needs is a good place for protests. Jantar Mantar is always so crowded thanks to thousands of useless protests that I never get a good place to sit there. Ramlila maidaan reminds me of Arvind Kejriwal and how he ditched me to start a political party so I don’t want to go there. Teen Murti Bhavan will be perfect as the location is good and there is sufficient area to accommodate dozens of my followers who would join me.”

“Right now, I can only protest during winters but at Teen Murti, I can protest indoors as well so summer protests will not be a problem as well. Then I can organize a fast unto death every month of the year. There are so many issues for which I have to protest so that will help me achieve my annual target of protests easily,” Mr. Hazare added.

The move however turned out to be an embarrassment for the Congress President, as the marksheet revealed some not so good facts about his academics. (At the request of Congress party Faking News will not be reproducing the content of the marksheet.)

While speaking to the media Amrinder Singh said, “I saw that many of you were still not convinced with my argument. So I am sharing Rahulji’s marksheet. Feast your eyes on it and see for yourself. He was in school at that time so how can you blame him. So what if the marks are not good. At least he has the courage to share it, unlike those in power who have things to hide and submit fake degrees.”

“Rahul is the low hanging fruit for the media. For BJP he is punching bag. But I feel he has been misunderstood all along. It is preposterous to blame him for something which took place when he was 13 years old. I agreee some of his statements give an impression that he is still 13, but that does not mean you can attribute the riots to him,” Mr. Singh said.

Congress Party has however dismissed Amrinder’s statement and said that the party President’s marksheet is not for public consumption. “That is not Rahulji’s marksheet.

The Congress party is really worried that if he keeps giving such speeches, they may face the same consequences as in 2014. The best way to save embarrassment is obviously by not speaking, but even if Rahul utters some words, it would be better for Congress if people don’t understand those words.

In fact Areal surveys are becoming a fashion statement nowadays. Shwetank Srivastava, a UP MLA actually did a survey of his own house where a terrace pipeline was leaking.

On Friday Morning, Shwetank was told by his servants that the terrace pipeline was leaking and the terrace was filled with water. It needed immediate attention from a plumber. But then reputation was also at stake. At a time when ministers and MPs are doing surveys of flood-hit areas, it doesn’t make sense for Shwetank to sit quietly. And so he took a major decision. Shwetank called a private chopper and went on the aerial survey of his house. The chopper flew for around 50 minutes over the top of Shwetank’s house. The result derived after the survey was that a plumber is required to fix the pipeline and Shwetank asked his secretary to give him a full report of the survey findings.

In fact, a press conference was called at his house where Shwetank briefed the media about the Aerial survey and the need to go for it. According to him, an aerial survey gives a full account of the incident and also the fix required for it. As from the ground, it is not possible to see everything that is impacting the terrace.

During a function in Germany, Mr Gandhi said that they will recruit ISIS head Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi as a Constable in Delhi Police, providing him a stable job and thus ending ISIS.

Earlier during his Euro Trip, Mr Gandhi had highlighted how lack of jobs led to the creation of ISIS, an organization that went on to unleash widespread terror around the world, and in Iraq and Syria in particular.

Speaking to a group of students, Mr Gandhi said, “We thought about various jobs for Baghdadi and concluded that a Police Constable will be the best post for him, a boring desk job may not be suitable for an all action Baghdadi. As a Police Constable in India, he can freely indulge in violence without any repercussions, of course he will have to stop killing people but that tendency will anyway get removed from his system once he gets a stable government job.”

“Our opponents in India can’t even provide jobs to Indian youth so there is no way they will be able to accommodate Baghdadi and his men in government jobs. They hate migrant workers as well so that is another problem in the current scenario. However, once we gain power in 2019, our first move will be to end global terrorism by advertising posts in Delhi Police for these people,” the Congress President added.

The Nitish Kumar government feels that prohibition has led to more women participating in the election process, fewer incidents of domestic violence and crime against women. Though the latest shelter home rape cases have exposed the govt findings. One problem the prohibition law has caused is that of celebrating Dry Day on important occasions like Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October. But Nitish Kumar seems to have found a solution for that too. Yes, Bihar government has decided to stop water supply throughout Bihar to celebrate the dry day.

The prohibition law, which Nitish’s government brought within six months of coming to power in 2015 was only one, though perhaps the most potent, of the elements of his strategy to create and nurture a political constituency among women. And now with an innovative way of celebrating Dry Day, Nitish is really making everyone happy. There are strict orders to all municipal corporations to stop water supply from 0000 Hrs on 2nd October. Any corporation found supplying water will be strictly dealt with and the same punishment will be given which is given to the bootleggers in the current scenario.

Citizens have been told to store extra water on 1st October so that they don’t face issues on 2nd October. Any person found drinking water in public will also be given warning.

A rather silent hunger strike is being held by the trio, but this time not against the Center or LG but against the decision of their own party member, Ashutosh.

Ashutosh had resigned from the party yesterday, and if sources are to be believed, the reason for doing so is best known to him only.

Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have spent the last night sleeping outside Ashutosh’s house, demanding cancellation of his resignation. Ashutosh plays an important role in the party and his absence will decrease the credibility of the party and will impact the party’s irrelevance in the current political scenario, where it is renowned for all things weird. Ashutosh is not only quitting AAP, but he has abandoned politics altogether.

Faking News reporter spoke to Yogendra Yadav, a former party member, and political analyst regarding Ashutosh’s abrupt resignation. Yogendra Yadav pointed out that Ashutosh was always meant to play a bigger role and if he has taken this decision consciously, unlike the way he tweets, then we must appreciate it. He further added that Ashutosh must return to journalism, which now has a dearth of good journalists who are ready to get humiliated and sometimes even slapped for reporting the truth.

It’s Arvind Kejriwal’s birthday today and party workers are confused where to reach to wish him.

Whether it is Jats or Patels or Marathas, reservation protests are more punctual than Monsoon in the country and this year, it is the turn of the Marathas. Maratha reservation protests have gained pace in the last few days and now Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has come up with a solution to end these protests.

Maharashtra Government has decided that they will increase the height of the proposed Shivaji statue in the Arabian Sea by 50 Metres to appease the angry protesters. The government is certain that this step will make everyone happy and will lead to an end to the protests.

Speaking to Faking News, an official working in the CMO said, “Statues are a solution to every problem, we have long established that. Now this proposed Shivaji statue will end the problem of reservations as well. We have already offered to increase the height of the statue by a further 50 Meters and if required, we can push it even higher. Height is not a problem but these protests and their problems should be resolved.”

When asked how will increasing the statue’s height resolve the problem of reservation, he said, “ The details are very technical and we don’t think you will understand. You just have to trust what we are doing and believe that all problems will be resolved once we increase the height of the statue.”

When asked if the problems of potholes on Mumbai roads can also be solved by increasing the height of the statue, he said, “Well, for that, we will need a statue taller than the Mount Everest.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/devendra-fadnavis1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/will-raise-height-shivaji-statue-50-metres-devendra-fadnavis-maratha-reservation-27166,Will raise the height of Shivaji statue by 50 Metres: Devendra Fadnavis on Maratha reservation,,1532941351.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Earlier today, she ordered cancellation of Narendra Modi’s Passport and has put a hold on any new Passport for him till further notice.

Sushma Ji took this decision after PM Modi’s 3 Nation trip to Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa. The External Affairs Minister greeted the PM at the airport and informed him that his passport is now useless.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a close aide of Sushma Ji said ,” Till now Modi ji was going to countries like USA, UK, Russia, China etc ahead of Sushma Ji so it was still acceptable but now this man is not even leaving countries like Uganda and Rwanda for Madam ji. This is seriously unacceptable and the only way to stop him from leaving again was cancelling his Passport. Only 8 months of government left man, should Madam also go somewhere or not, after all she is the foreign minister.”

“He keeps traveling to a different country every day and Madam ji spends her whole day reading her Twitter mentions. This is unfair na.

Experienced faster Hazare has asked the government to declare it as the designated place for all fasts unto death to be held in the capital from now on.

Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written a letter opposing any changes to the present complex as it will detract from Pandit Nehru’s legacy. Congress has been opposing any plans to change Teen Murti Bhavan but sources say they may agree to Anna Hazare’s proposal.

Speaking to the media at the site of a protest, Anna Hazare said, “What Delhi needs is a good place for protests. Jantar Mantar is always so crowded thanks to thousands of useless protests that I never get a good place to sit there. Ramlila maidaan reminds me of Arvind Kejriwal and how he ditched me to start a political party so I don’t want to go there. Teen Murti Bhavan will be perfect as the location is good and there is sufficient area to accommodate dozens of my followers who would join me.”

“Right now, I can only protest during winters but at Teen Murti, I can protest indoors as well so summer protests will not be a problem as well. Then I can organize a fast unto death every month of the year. There are so many issues for which I have to protest so that will help me achieve my annual target of protests easily,” Mr. Hazare added.

Further, Mr. Hazare said, “If government doesn’t agree to my demand, I will start a fast unto death till they agree.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/anna-hazare.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/convert-teen-murti-bhavan-designated-protest-place-anna-hazare-27482,Convert Teen Murti Bhavan to a designated protest place: Anna Hazare,,1535438632.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The move however turned out to be an embarrassment for the Congress President, as the marksheet revealed some not so good facts about his academics. (At the request of Congress party Faking News will not be reproducing the content of the marksheet.)

While speaking to the media Amrinder Singh said, “I saw that many of you were still not convinced with my argument. So I am sharing Rahulji’s marksheet. Feast your eyes on it and see for yourself. He was in school at that time so how can you blame him. So what if the marks are not good. At least he has the courage to share it, unlike those in power who have things to hide and submit fake degrees.”

“Rahul is the low hanging fruit for the media. For BJP he is punching bag. But I feel he has been misunderstood all along. It is preposterous to blame him for something which took place when he was 13 years old. I agreee some of his statements give an impression that he is still 13, but that does not mean you can attribute the riots to him,” Mr. Singh said.

Congress Party has however dismissed Amrinder’s statement and said that the party President’s marksheet is not for public consumption. “That is not Rahulji’s marksheet. How can he score 20 out of 100 in English. I personally did all his homework and helped him study during exams,” said a surprised Shashi Tharoor.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/aa-Cover-hlf797nuqqobbaks5dtslgjhb0-20171204004724.Medi_.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/amrinder-singh-shares-rahul-gandhis-embarrassing-mark-sheet-prove-school-84-riots-27470,Amrinder Singh shares copy of Rahul Gandhi’s embarrassing mark sheet to prove he was in school during 84 riots,,1535362342.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

He was seen at a food stall later. Not before giving the trollers some meaty material by the way of a collage taken at the German parliament. But the roof came crashing down when on asked about Doklam, he said that he doesn’t have the details of the issue. This is the same Rahul Gandhi who for last one year has been accusing the govt of playing it softly at Doklam.

The Congress party is really worried that if he keeps giving such speeches, they may face the same consequences as in 2014. The best way to save embarrassment is obviously by not speaking, but even if Rahul utters some words, it would be better for Congress if people don’t understand those words. And taking a step in this direction, Rahul Gandhi will undergo training under Mulayam Singh Yadav for 1 month to utter words which cannot be understood by people.

Mulayam has given many controversial statements, but none of those statements were ever understood by the media. It was only after the media hired experts to decode his speeches that they were able to understand what Netaji meant to say.

In fact Areal surveys are becoming a fashion statement nowadays. Shwetank Srivastava, a UP MLA actually did a survey of his own house where a terrace pipeline was leaking.

On Friday Morning, Shwetank was told by his servants that the terrace pipeline was leaking and the terrace was filled with water. It needed immediate attention from a plumber. But then reputation was also at stake. At a time when ministers and MPs are doing surveys of flood-hit areas, it doesn’t make sense for Shwetank to sit quietly. And so he took a major decision. Shwetank called a private chopper and went on the aerial survey of his house. The chopper flew for around 50 minutes over the top of Shwetank’s house. The result derived after the survey was that a plumber is required to fix the pipeline and Shwetank asked his secretary to give him a full report of the survey findings.

In fact, a press conference was called at his house where Shwetank briefed the media about the Aerial survey and the need to go for it. According to him, an aerial survey gives a full account of the incident and also the fix required for it. As from the ground, it is not possible to see everything that is impacting the terrace. After looking at the incident, more MLAs have gone ahead with the decision to do more aerial surveys in future.

During a function in Germany, Mr Gandhi said that they will recruit ISIS head Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi as a Constable in Delhi Police, providing him a stable job and thus ending ISIS.

Earlier during his Euro Trip, Mr Gandhi had highlighted how lack of jobs led to the creation of ISIS, an organization that went on to unleash widespread terror around the world, and in Iraq and Syria in particular.

Speaking to a group of students, Mr Gandhi said, “We thought about various jobs for Baghdadi and concluded that a Police Constable will be the best post for him, a boring desk job may not be suitable for an all action Baghdadi. As a Police Constable in India, he can freely indulge in violence without any repercussions, of course he will have to stop killing people but that tendency will anyway get removed from his system once he gets a stable government job.”

“Our opponents in India can’t even provide jobs to Indian youth so there is no way they will be able to accommodate Baghdadi and his men in government jobs. They hate migrant workers as well so that is another problem in the current scenario. However, once we gain power in 2019, our first move will be to end global terrorism by advertising posts in Delhi Police for these people,” the Congress President added.

Congress is now expecting support from the entire world during next year’s general elections in India as they have promised to deliver a world free of terrorism.

The Nitish Kumar government feels that prohibition has led to more women participating in the election process, fewer incidents of domestic violence and crime against women. Though the latest shelter home rape cases have exposed the govt findings. One problem the prohibition law has caused is that of celebrating Dry Day on important occasions like Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October. But Nitish Kumar seems to have found a solution for that too. Yes, Bihar government has decided to stop water supply throughout Bihar to celebrate the dry day.

The prohibition law, which Nitish’s government brought within six months of coming to power in 2015 was only one, though perhaps the most potent, of the elements of his strategy to create and nurture a political constituency among women. And now with an innovative way of celebrating Dry Day, Nitish is really making everyone happy. There are strict orders to all municipal corporations to stop water supply from 0000 Hrs on 2nd October. Any corporation found supplying water will be strictly dealt with and the same punishment will be given which is given to the bootleggers in the current scenario.

Citizens have been told to store extra water on 1st October so that they don’t face issues on 2nd October. Any person found drinking water in public will also be given warning. This seems to be a great decision for the chai lovers in Bihar as on 2nd October they will get pure-milk tea, which is a rarity nowadays.

Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have spent the last night sleeping outside Ashutosh’s house, demanding cancellation of his resignation. Ashutosh plays an important role in the party and his absence will decrease the credibility of the party and will impact the party’s irrelevance in the current political scenario, where it is renowned for all things weird.

“All the MPs doing the challenge on the road could have created problems for the other commuters so we requested Delhi Police to make some arrangements. They have decided to close the road completely to make sure common people aren’t affected while we do our challenge,” the MP added.

A Delhi Police official while confirming the news said, “Actually, we just didn’t want the people to see their elected representatives acting like fools and then falling down on the side of the road in the process. They may have started wondering about the point of democracy itself.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/will-raise-height-shivaji-statue-50-metres-devendra-fadnavis-maratha-reservation-27166,"Mumbai: Every year there is a protest from one community in India for reservation. Whether it is Jats or Patels or Marathas, reservation protests are more punctual than Monsoon in the country and this year, it is the turn of the Marathas. Maratha reservation protests have gained pace in the last few days and now Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has come up with a solution to end these protests.

Maharashtra Government has decided that they will increase the height of the proposed Shivaji statue in the Arabian Sea by 50 Metres to appease the angry protesters. The government is certain that this step will make everyone happy and will lead to an end to the protests.

Speaking to Faking News, an official working in the CMO said, “Statues are a solution to every problem, we have long established that. Now this proposed Shivaji statue will end the problem of reservations as well. We have already offered to increase the height of the statue by a further 50 Meters and if required, we can push it even higher. Height is not a problem but these protests and their problems should be resolved.”

When asked how will increasing the statue’s height resolve the problem of reservation, he said, “ The details are very technical and we don’t think you will understand. You just have to trust what we are doing and believe that all problems will be resolved once we increase the height of the statue.”

When asked if the problems of potholes on Mumbai roads can also be solved by increasing the height of the statue, he said, “Well, for that, we will need a statue taller than the Mount Everest.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/devendra-fadnavis1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/will-raise-height-shivaji-statue-50-metres-devendra-fadnavis-maratha-reservation-27166,Will raise the height of Shivaji statue by 50 Metres: Devendra Fadnavis on Maratha reservation,,1532941351.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Earlier today, she ordered cancellation of Narendra Modi’s Passport and has put a hold on any new Passport for him till further notice.

Sushma Ji took this decision after PM Modi’s 3 Nation trip to Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa. The External Affairs Minister greeted the PM at the airport and informed him that his passport is now useless.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a close aide of Sushma Ji said ,” Till now Modi ji was going to countries like USA, UK, Russia, China etc ahead of Sushma Ji so it was still acceptable but now this man is not even leaving countries like Uganda and Rwanda for Madam ji. This is seriously unacceptable and the only way to stop him from leaving again was cancelling his Passport. Only 8 months of government left man, should Madam also go somewhere or not, after all she is the foreign minister.”

“He keeps traveling to a different country every day and Madam ji spends her whole day reading her Twitter mentions. This is unfair na. As foreign minister, she should be going to all these countries as they are part of her portfolio. Now we decided enough is enough and cancelled his Passport to ground him”, the source added

He said that he is ready to leave the government bungalow but needs a little bit of time to arrange his affairs. He promised to vacate the day Congress President Rahul Gandhi becomes PM, saying that it will give him enough time to arrange everything.

All former chief ministers were asked to vacate their allotted bungalows in 15 days by the Uttar Pradesh government after the Supreme Court said that former chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh cannot retain government accommodation after demitting office. While some former CMs started looking for alternative accommodations, BSP supremo Mayawati simply added a board outside her bungalow stating it is ‘Shri Kanshi Ramji Yaadgaar Vishram Sthal’ which is intended to stop government from forcing her out. Akhilesh Yadav has, however, decided to directly ask for more time.

Speaking to Faking News, Mr. Akhilesh Yadav said,” As a Chief Minister, I had gathered a lot of things in this house. There are so many items to sort through, there are so many formalities to be carried out. Will need to finalise a new home, right now nobody is giving me a house on rent thinking they will never give the rent. Once a new house is finalised, will need to get address changed on all our Aadhar Cards and other documents, all these things take a lot of time.”

“I am not saying I will never vacate, I am just saying that by the time Rahul Ji becomes PM, I would have sorted out all these things and on the day he takes oath, I will call a Tata 407 to take our belongings to the new house”, the former CM added.

Two-time Vijayanagara (Ballari) MLA Anand Singh has been doing a flip-flop on his support to the Congress. The incident has put Congress into a spot of bother as they fear Amit Shah finding and dealing with their MLAs to form a government.

This is when a senior Congress member Jagdish Malik from Bareily came up with an innovative plan. He suggested the Congress working committee to put all MLAs into a Virar local in Mumbai, as it is very tough to find people in a Virar local which is packed to the brim. Virar Locals are known for their passengers filling up the train, train roofs, train doors and almost every inch of space available in the train. Today morning, it was announced by the Congress party that they will put the MLAs in a Virar local as soon as possible and the MLAs have already started their journey towards Mumbai.

Mumbai Suburban Railway authorities have promised that the MLAs will be pushed into the most crowded trains and will commute to and from Virar to Churchgate on a daily basis. No one has ever had the guts to go inside a Virar local to find people, so it has to be seen what steps does Amit Shah take to get hold of 8 MLAs.

Congress has alleged that BJP has hired Thanos as part of their efforts to secure majority during the floor test. It has been alleged that BJP wants Thanos to snap his fingers and get rid of 50% of the Congress MLAs resulting in reduced numbers for INC-JDS alliance in the assembly, securing the trust vote for BS Yeddyurappa.

As per current calculations, BJP needs some MLAs from INC-JDS alliance to abstain to get the required majority in the house and if Thanos removes as many as 50% of the MLAs then it will be a cakewalk for BJP in the assembly.

Speaking to Faking News, one of the Congress MLAs said,” We have got confirmed news from sources that Amit Shah has approached Thanos and Thanos has even accepted the offer. Of course, he will agree, we think those 2 are brothers. Look at their faces, they look so similar. All of our MLAs must be protected from Thanos at any cost to save democracy.”

“We appeal to all superheroes in the world to reveal themselves now and protect us from Shah-Thanos combination. Rahul Gandhi Ji is a superhero but we don’t think 1 superhero can match Thanos”, he added.

According to Basavaraj, “Immediately after collecting the letter from election officials, he called me saying, I am going underground. Taking my family along with me. Basava bhai just take care of my house till I come back”.

Society has to be built up. Civil engineers have this knowledge… Because those in the administration have to build a society,” he said at an event at the Prajna Bhavan in Agartala on Friday. But he didn’t stop at that, he also conveyed that it should be the school students who should join IT companies instead of the engineers as they have a better experience of sitting on the bench.

IT companies recruit in heavy numbers to show manpower to the clients and this strategy results in many engineers sitting on benches and wasting time. According to Biplab, school students should be recruited for this job and not the college students. This will save a lot of useful manpower to be wasted and also train the school kids for the journey ahead. IT companies can also do some cost-cutting as recruitment from schools would make them do away with the lengthy recruitment process.

Companies in IT hub like Bengaluru have taken a great liking for the suggestion and have started implementing it. HR managers were seen outside school campuses waiting for kids to fight for their place at the reputed IT companies.

Several resorts in neighboring Goa have already been booked by these parties to hide their MLAs in case of a hung assembly. The idea is to stop Amit Shah from poaching them and forming a BJP Government in such a scenario. A number of resorts have been booked to make sure Amit Shah and BJP top brass don’t figure out the exact location where MLAs are kept before government formation.

Confirming the news, a Karnataka Congress leader said,” We don’t want a repeat of Goa or Manipur or Meghalaya where we emerge as the single largest party only for BJP to put together enough MLAs to form the government. We are confident that we will get majority on our own but even if we don’t, it is good to be prepared for any eventuality. Hiding the MLAs worked for us during Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections and we are going to do the same this time. Since the stakes are higher, we don’t even want Amit Shah to find out the location where our MLAs will be hiding so we have booked several resorts and MLAs will be kept in any one of those.”

Hoteliers in Goa are very happy with this development as number of tourists decreases significantly during the peak summer months of May and June but now thanks to political tourism, several resorts have been booked for weeks in advance.

Reacting to this step by Congress, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said,” In case there is a hung assembly, we know what we have to do.

As the images of Chhole-Bhature circulated all over social media, the demand for this item rose sharply across all the restaurants in Delhi. To capitalize on this popularity, a halwai in Chandni Chowk has launched a special range of Chhole-Bhature that can be consumed before any fast.

Initially I kept telling them that there is no separate version for fasts but then, I saw the opportunity there. We prepared a special plate of Chhole-Bhature that was guaranteed to stuff your stomach so much that you won’t feel hungry for the next 24 hrs.”

“Initial response to the sample dish was very good with the first 5 customers who tried it going into a food coma.

As the rumor spread quickly in different parts of UP, BJP leaders have taken stock of the situation are working very hard to avoid taking Amar Singh into their party. Sources have confirmed that Amar Singh did meet the UP CM and conveyed his desire to join the ruling party.

Amar Singh joining BJP would be a major blow for the party which is doing very well in all major states. There is a Modi wave which is sweeping across oppositions and taking hold of the nation’s politics. The last thing BJP would want is someone like Amar Singh joining him who was expelled from a big party like the Samajwadi party. A committee was formed headed by Amit Shah who also heads 219 other committees and a decision was made that clearing the Yo-Yo test would be made mandatory to join the party. This way people like Amar Singh and other leaders would not be able to join the ruling party. BJP is in constant touch with the BCCI to understand the implementation of Yo-Yo test and its benefits. BCCI will also provide a technician to keep a record of the tests and results.

Amar Singh, who is an expert in forming alliances and mergers, does have one weakness and that is the fitness part. Neither does he look athletic and neither does he have any interests in the fitness regimes. So it is to be seen if he is so desperate to join BJP that he will train hard and clear the yo-yo test too.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6-amar-singh-film-acting3.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/hearing-rumor-amar-singh-wants-join-bjp-makes-clearing-yo-yo-test-compulsory-join-party-27104,"Hearing the rumor that Amar Singh wants to join them, BJP makes clearing yo-yo test compulsory to join party",,1532414037.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“This is middle of July, we have good five more months to go before 2018 comes to an end. You have scheduled only four foreign trips for PM”, quoting a portion of the strongly worded letter Mr. Nripendra Misra, PM Modi’s personal secretary has written to them.

Mr. Misra has specified in his letter, “It’s not about four trips only, just look at the kind of countries to which you have scheduled visits. South Africa, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Argentina. In a rating scale of ‘SMART’ (where ‘S’ means top performer and ‘T ‘means worst), I give all of you ‘T’ rating”.

Mr. Misra has not stopped there. He has put them under Personal Improvement Plan (PIP) for next six months and have transferred them to rural areas to look after departments like animal husbandry, fisheries etc.

One of source who has got ‘T’ rating countered Misra Ji’s rating. He said, “We did not schedule many trips for PM as some important state elections are coming, he would campaign for the party. There are talks in PMO that general elections for 2019 might be preponed to end of this calendar year”.

He added, “Even if that does not happen, we wanted PM Modi to get some rest before three or four months of campaigning needed for general election. Post 2019 election he will be back in PM’s chair, he can again resume his foreign trips. That’s the reason we made second half of 2018 as a lean travel time for him”, said our source who showed he has three invitations from Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar. He can schedule visits to those places immediately if he gets go-ahead from Misra Ji.

“Ab yeh nahin chalege, students have to meet the mandatory attendance needed”, said Prakash Kumar, registrar of JNU after signing the notice.

He added, “We know students have other priorities. We cannot be tough on them. Considering all the factors including the average attendance record of the last ten years, the attendance committee of the institute has kept it 5 percent for academic years 2018-19”.

Mr. Kumar a veteran of the institute for last thirty-five years feels, it would be tough for some, if they try, they can meet this ‘reasonable’ number.

Mr. Kumar said, the attendance committee has come with Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) for next ten years. AIP mandates these five percent mandatory days to be increased by 0.5% every year.

“We must reach ten per attendance figure by 2030 when India becomes third largest economy in the world”, said Mr. Kumar who expects by that time JNU would be among top three universities in the world.

Students are angry after reading the notice. They feel it is done to curtail their freedom.

“Why the figure is mandated for us, why no such number mentioned for teachers”, said Kanhaiya lal student leader who led a protest team to ‘gherao’ the registrar in his office.

“On top of it, it mandates five percent figure for all. Why there is no relaxation for SC, ST, OBC as well as minorities. We will not accept such orders, no one will sign the undertaking”, said Kanhaiya lal.

Uddhav Thackeray has asked BJP governments in Center and Maharashtra to place a ban on the song ZIngaat from the upcoming Bollywood movie Dhadak, failing which, Shiv Sena will not contest 2019 Lok Sabha elections with BJP.

“I will use this sword.”

Dhadak is a remake of Marathi superhit Sairat marking the debut of Sridevi’s daughter Janhvi Kapoor and is set to release this July. Fans of original Sairat were already displeased with the trailer of the film and the Bollywood treatment given to a Marathi classic but the Hindi version of Zingaat seems to have pushed their anger beyond boiling point. To protect the sentiments of ZIngaat lovers, Shiv Sena has raised this demand so that the song no longer hurts the ears of the lovers of the original.

Speaking to Faking News, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, ”We knew they were going to ruin our Marathi film but still, we thought let them give it a try but the treatment given to ZIngaat is simply unacceptable. It has hurt the sentiments of the people and an immediate ban is required. They should also be fined for offending all Marathis in general and Zingaat fans in particular for this terrible act.”

After hearing this news, Dhadak’s producer Karan Johar reached MNS leader Raj Thackeray’s house where he was told that this time it is the other Thackeray who is upset.

Sushma Ji is on a 7 day tour of European countries, an opportunity she had never got before during her reign. The reason being Modiji personally visiting all countries and not taking her along. But Sushma finally found a way out and sneaked in to tour European countries as part of bilateral talks while Modi Ji was busy making the fitness challenge video.

Ms Swaraj will travel later today to France where she will spend two days. The news is surprising as she has been given a list by the PMO about the countries she can visit. The list includes Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan, African Countries, Sri lanka and Myanmar. All the other countires were to be covered by PM Modi personally. But it is no secret that Sushma Ji also wanted to visit exotic locations. The external affairs ministry had tried hard to schedule a secret visit for her but every time the PMO intervened. Finally Sushma Ji found a way out. She was aware that Modi Ji would be busy shooting the fitness video for 2-3 days and won’t be taking stock of other happenings. That is when she selected some of the best European countries and sneaked in for a nice tour.

According to secret sources, the PMO is finally aware about this tour and has sent a letter to the External Ministry to explain such tour when the countries mentioned in the tour plan are not approved by PMO. External Affairs ministry is waiting for Sushma Ji to come back and draft a reply. When Faking News team tried to contact Sushma Ji, she was unreachable.

From ‘Ice Bucket Challenge’ to the latest ‘Hum Fit Toh India Fit Challenge’, people have been tagging each other to take up one challenge or the other. Under the latest ‘Hum Fit Toh India Fit Challenge’, PM Narendra Modi recently released his workout video after being challenged by Indian Cricket Captain Virat Kohli but now Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given a challenge that Mr Modi may not be able to complete.

Rahul Gandhi has challenged the Prime Minister to watch the latest Salman Khan film Race 3 in a move that has stumped the ruling BJP.

Speaking to the media outside Congress HQ, Mr Gandhi said, “That fitness challenge was easy and Modi Ji made it even easier by doing simple exercises in that video. Now we challenge him to watch the complete film Race 3. He can’t sneak out after 1 hour and has to watch it right till the very end. He should not sleep during the film and even phone calls will not be allowed. If he completes this challenge, we are even ready to withdraw from the 2019 elections.”

This challenge has worried the entire BJP with the reviews suggesting that several audience members have gone into comma after watching the film. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra even went on to call this challenge an attempt on the life of the Prime Minister.

Pictures showed damage to some floor tiles and laminations. Air conditioning ducts of the centrally air-conditioned house had been plucked out and some of the electrical switchboards were missing. The incident has spoilt the reputation of Akhilesh Yadav and even the Dalit households are scared as he is planning a visit soon to their houses. A Dalit family in Lucknow was seen hiding their electrical equipment and furniture after hearing that Akhilesh Ji will soon pay them a visit.

The hotels where Akhilesh stays during his political meetings and press conferences are also cautious of the fact that the politician may steal their appliances while leaving and so they have also kept all appliances hidden. Even the cars in which Akhilesh moves around for his political commitments were seen covering their AC ducts and seats were tied up properly. The UP government is surprised by the fact the ACs which were installed in Akhilesh’s house were pretty properly fixed and it demanded a humongous effort to remove them. That Akhilesh was able to remove them so easily is still a big surprise for the government estate department.

But the good news for the Dalit families is that at least Akhilesh is sending a prior notification before visiting otherwise they would have faced the catch 22 situation. It is so considerate of him to first announce his visit and then visit the house of a Dalit. This would give the Dalit family ample time to hide or shift their electrical appliances to some other place.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Akhilesh1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dalit-family-seen-hiding-electrical-equipment-akhilesh-yadav-plans-spend-night-home-26666,Dalit family seen hiding their electrical appliances after Akhilesh Yadav plans to spend a night at their home,,1528702048.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The video shows with different timestamp when PM Modi is climbing up or down on airplane stairs. Looking at the dress PM is wearing, happiness on his face and the way he is waiving towards the people, clarity of the video due to lack of pollution in environment, our guess is, the video footage has been taken from his foreign trips.

“Leaders like Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari, Uma Bharati are nervous from the time Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore has started this exercise.

The Petroleum ministry was constantly hearing the news about the number ‘112’ and so pushed the price so much that the petrol price will soon reach 112.

Sachin had a problem with the nervous nineties where he lost his wicket many times and now the government wants to use this expertise. Sachin will sit with the Petroleum executives to discuss how to instill that nervousness into the petrol prices. Advise will also be taken from MS Dhoni to make sure the prices rise slowly just like his strike rate in recent games.

Currently, the petrol price is burning a hole in the pocket of customers and many have stopped using their private vehicle, except Gurgaon and Noida where people buy more cars when the price of Petrol increases. Now all eyes are on Sachin Tendulkar to fil the country with happiness again like the way he did in his playing days.

SBI employees are seldom seen turning away customers saying that its lunchtime and they should visit after some time. But that’s only one part of the story, the employees also spend time in playing solaitaire on their desktops. The game is very famous among the older employees and now even the younger employees have joined the bandwagon.

These bouncers will be placed at the exits of both houses of the Parliament and they will have the power to stop anyone from leaving the house.

The current session of the Parliament has hardly seen any constructive work with frequent adjournments. “The only time we have them all sitting quietly is when we discuss pay hike of MPs,” said an observer.

Before narrowing down on bouncers, Govt had considered other options such as ordering pizza, screening of cricket matches and so on to quell the ruckus in the house. “Nothing seemed to have worked. So the only option left was to use the services of a bouncer,” said a source close to the development.

The decision evoked mixed reaction from Parliamentarians. Opposition parties thought that the decision was harsh and severe and infringed on their right to expression. “Arre ye koi pub hai kya ki yaha bouncer rakhiyega. Jab marshall hai Parliament mein toh bouncer ki kya zaroorat. Sarkaar ko humse maafi maangni chahiye,” screamed an opposition MP.

Earlier this month, Sambit had requested Republic TV editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami, to allow him some space in the office premises so that he can shift there permanently along with his family members. It was a real pain for Sambit to commute daily during peak hours in the terrible traffic conditions. In fact Sambit, who works like and shows the punctuality of a corporate employee has opted for the work from home option at the BJP headquarters.

Traffic is a big problem in a metro like Mumbai and it makes sense for more and more employees to work from home instead of clogging the roads. Sambit realized the fact that he spends more time in the Republic studios than his own home and so it is like his home. BJP members also recognize the importance of Sambit defending government’s decisions on prime time television. Sambit will inspire many other spokespersons from different parties to start working from the news channels which are their favorite.

Confirming the news, Sambit said, “It took me a lot of time and effort to travel to Republic TV studio for the debate every day. Arnab and I belong to the same party… oops! I mean, we go to a lot of parties together. So, he had to do me a favor by giving me and my family some space in his office. After all, I have been the most consistent thing on the debate after the noise.”

We are ready to appear in Republic TV debates again if Arnab allows us to stay in his office like he allowed Sambit,” he said.

This now temporarily ends Laloo Prasad Yadav’s political career. In South Africa though, chief executive David Richardson laid the charge against Australia captain Steve Smith that eventually led to the latter being handed a one-match ban and 100% fine of the match fee. This has been looked upon to be very lenient punishment for the Australian captain.

RJD leaders were sure that Laloo would surely like to appeal to the higher court, but looking at the judgment in the ball tampering case, Laloo now wants his court case to be shifted to the ICC panel. Laloo has also drafted the advantages of international judgment. According to him, 1) ICC is an international body, so there will be no bias towards any politician. 2) The judgment will be delivered in a speedy way just like the Steve Smith case. 3) SO many court cases are pending in Indian courts and it will give a relief to the already burdened courts.

Looking at Laloo’s request, many politicians like A.raja, P Chidabaram, Madhu Koda and others have requested the government to pass a bill which will make it mandatory for all cases involving politicians to be fought in the ICC. This looks like a revenue generation opportunity for ICC which can charge the Indian judiciary for every verdict delivered by the panelists.

A few days back he missed being on a new channel because he was on a show on some other news channel. He really felt bad after not keeping the commitment with one channel. So much so that, yesterday he announced in a press conference that he has hired a spokesperson who would help him keep all commitments.

To hire the spokesperson Sambit held a tough selection process. The process started with an essay writing competition, debate competition, a running race to see if the person reaches all channels on time and also a shouting competition where a competitor has to shout at loudest of his voice. After all the rounds were completed a personal interview with Sambit was the final round and that is how Mr. Shwetank Srivastava was selected as the official spokesperson of Sambit Patra.

It is yet to be seen as to which news debate will Shwetank make his debut with, but what will be more interesting to see is whether he will create the same magic as Sambit does.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BeFunky-Collage-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sambit-patra-hires-spokesperson-not-able-reach-news-debates-simultaneously-25991,Sambit Patra hires a spokesperson as he was not able to reach all news debates simultaneously,,1521784307.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

He became the first CM in history who inaugurated an underpass in couple of hours after he did Bhumi Pujan at the same place.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah being welcomed by congress workers during the inauguration of various developmental works of BBMP at Shankar Mutt ward, Kurubarahalli in Bangalore on Wednesday. –KPN ### CM inaugurates BBMP developmental works

The reason is before election dates are announced by EC and model code of conduct comes in to effect, CM and his team wants to complete all the ‘development’ activities they had assured voters five years back when they came to power.

The ‘Pundit’ was gathering his own stuff to leave the place after Bhumi Pujan when authorities asked him to stay back and complete the puja for the inauguration of the underpass. Shell shocked Pundit asked his assistant to get the book to do the puja related to completion of the project from his residence quickly. Government officials arranged a special vehicle and made sure traffic movement is well-coordinated so that the assistant reaches the spot before ‘auspicious time’ marked for the ceremony.

When we asked Mr. K.J George, Minister for Bengaluru Development and Town Planning, why the projects are being inaugurated and dedicated to public when no one can use them, he said, “Already enough credit BJP has taken on the good work we started at the center under UPA. Why we will repeat the same mistake and give BJP ‘another’ chance to claim credit in case they come to power. So, in the cabinet meeting we decided whatever ‘state’ the projects are, we will inaugurate them”.

However, Mr. George has asked Bengaluru development authority to mention the date at each of the project site, when they will be ready for public use. For the underpass date was mentioned July 2027.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/15SIDDU1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/stop-bjp-taking-credit-ktaka-cm-inaugurates-underpass-couple-hours-bhumi-pujan-25988,"To stop BJP taking credit, K’taka CM inaugurates the underpass in couple of hours after he did Bhumi Pujan",,1521711028.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A month after Kamalhaasan has announced his political party’s name, Rajnikanth now announces the date on which the date for announcing the name will be announced. The fundamental difference between the two newborn leaders lies in the color of the symbol of the party, it is believed by the political analysts in the state.

While Kamal Hassan’s party has a symbol of enjoined hands with black, white and red, indicating a left leaning, Thalaiva’s party is expected to have Saffron as the colour, indicating a right leaning, it is learnt by Faking News. The fans are in no rush as they have waited for 20 years for the announcement on whether there will be a party. Now they are more than pleased to wait just 2 years to get to know the name of the party, it is further learnt by Faking News.

“None of us have expected that our beloved leader actually would announce a political party and encourage us to participate in the Assembly Elections. We really do not need a name now; actually being anonymous is more charming than something like maiam. All we need is an MLA seat in our new party. If the legend is to become true, the election commission will extend the name, the symbol and the office building to our party” a die hard fan of super star told Faking News, suppressing a smile and taking a dig at the newly announced Kamal Hassan’s party.

“Until the next Assembly Elections, no one is going to question the actor on his entry into politics. Now he is free to do more movies acting as hero at the age of 67. The movies are bound to run well given the added popularity with the political entry and everything. He is not just a smart politician; he is actually more smart to use politics to make his movies run better. If Kaala fails at box office then the party’s name will immediately be announced. If 2.0 fails at box office then there will not be any party” a political analyst took a strong critical view on the super star’s political tactics.

Top astrologers in the country are now predicting the date on which Rajinikanth’s political party’s name will be announced.

He issued this statement after journalists rushed to get his reaction to BJP’s defeat in by-polls in Phulpur and Gorakhpur. Mr. Agarwal told all the journalists present there that they should go to some BJP leader to get the reaction to the defeat and he said that as an SP member, he is very happy with the results.

Did he get his timing wrong?

Earlier in the day, Samajwadi Party defeated Bharatiya Janata Party in its stronghold of Gorakhpur and also in Phulpur bypoll. These elections were held after current Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM KP maurya had to vacate their seats after getting elected to the state assembly.

When someone reminded Mr. Agarwal that he had joined BJP just a couple of days back, he said ,”This is typical media tactic of misquoting politicians. I never said that I was joining BJP, I just said that I was going to BJP’s headquarters for a party and you guys made it sound like I am joining their party, there is nothing like that. I am a proud member of Samajwadi Party and will continue to work for them.”

When another journalist pointed out that he is on video talking about joining BJP, he said ,”I am standing here and telling you that I have not joined BJP and you want to talk about some video? What is more genuine, the person himself or a video? I request all you media persons to stop misquoting me please.”

This text was sent after another SP leader, Naresh Agarwal, joined BJP in Delhi.

“Kamal ka phool to dikh nahi raha, Galat jagah to nahin aa gaya”

Naresh Agarwal is not the first Samajwadi Party leader to head to BJP. Several others have done so as well over the past 2 years with several shifts happening ahead of the 2017 UP assembly elections. Now fearing that he may get left behind on his own, Mulayam Ji has made this request.

Commenting on this development, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said ,”Of course if Mulayam Singh ji wants to come then he is most welcome to BJP. We have always welcomed leaders from Samajwadi Party with open arms since these are 2 very like-minded parties. Therefore, a Samajwadi leader is a natural fit in BJP. We have had leaders who seamlessly shifted from being SP spokesperson to BJP spokesperson.”

When asked if BJP will only accept SP leaders, Mr. Bhatia said ,”No, it is not like that. We have accepted leaders from Congress, BSP etc as well. Everyone is like minded here so there is no issue with acquisition from any other party.”

Congress leaders from all over India started a signature campaign asking Rahul Gandhi to get married, to ensure their future president. The future of the party is totally dependent on Rahulji’s to-be-born son or daughter. The signature campaign will influence our leader to get married in the coming months, one of the leaders from the capital city told Faking News, wearing a mask.

“Our president’s personal life is totally separate from his public life. However, our party’s leadership is very important to us. When Soniaji was Congress president, we were not worried about future leadership. Rahulji was waiting to take over. With our leader remaining as the most eligible bachelor in the country, we have no choice but to interfere in his personal life and ask him to get married soon,” one of the long-term party leader told Faking News.

“In the past several years, our party has seen a reluctant president, a reluctant politician, a reluctant vice president and a reluctant prime minister. Now, our new leader is very reluctant to get married. We were reluctant too, at first, to start this signature campaign. Some senior leaders gave us encouragement by signing the petition as the first group to lead the way for others. Indian national Congress always believed in democracy and once our future leader is born, there will be a democratic process to elect him as our president,” a junior leader told Faking News.

“It is not dynasty. That is an old practice when a king or queen announces the next ruler. Ours is a democratic party with a democratic process. We choose our leader. From the day our president’s son or daughter is born, the process will start,” a highly educated Congress leader told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rahul-1.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leaders-start-signature-campaign-asking-rahul-gandhi-get-married-ensure-future-president-25889,"Congress leaders start a signature campaign asking Rahul Gandhi to get married, to ensure their future president",,1520584494.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Supreme leader gave this warning after learning about the removal of Lenin’s statue in the Indian state of Tripura. After the defeat of CPM in the recent assembly elections, Lenin’s statue was removed by alleged BJP workers yesterday.

Lenin on the way out

Kim Jong Un has been a hero for communists in Kerala and his posters have come up more than once in the state recently. After removal of Lenin’s statue, Kim Jong Un is worried that his posters may become the next target. He thinks a mob of BJP workers may try to burn them or tear them up and he has asked PM Narendra Modi to avoid such a situation else he will launch Nuclear missiles targeting all major Indian cities.

An official DPRK spokesperson said ,”Even though our Supreme Leader is generally a very peaceful man but if some lines are crossed, he gets a little bit angry. Any mob touching his posters will be crossing that line and then India will have to pay. Our Nuclear missiles are already ready for an attack and we will just have to change the target from Donald Trump’s Golf Course to Indian cities. Comrade Lenin was not around to defend himself so they could remove his statue but Supreme Leader is still around and will not tolerate anyone messing with his posters.”

It is alleged Karti had received funds to the tune of Rs 10 lakh in the case. However, Mr. Chidambaram’s lawyers have called the entire case bogus and alleged that fake allegations have been leveled against their client.

A lawyer representing Karthi Chidambaram said ,”It is absolutely ridiculous, they are saying that the son of the then Finance Minister accepted only 10 lakhs as the bribe? What is he, a Junior Engineer in the municipal office of a remote town? Add to that the fact that our client is a politician in his own right and even contested Lok Sabha elections once. This stature entitles a politician to a minimum bribe of 100 Crores and they are making a case of 10 lakhs? Which self respecting politician will accept a bribe of 10 lakhs?

However, BJP has rubbished the allegations that this is a politically motivated arrest. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Karthi’s lawyers are trying to mislead the nation by saying the amount is too low for a political bribe. We have seen senior politicians willing to accept even 1 lakh as a bribe in the past. Every drop counts, 10 lakh bribes of 10 lakhs each will make the whole amount politically acceptable or not?”

While some former CMs started looking for alternative accommodations, BSP supremo Mayawati simply added a board outside her bungalow stating it is ‘Shri Kanshi Ramji Yaadgaar Vishram Sthal’ which is intended to stop government from forcing her out. Akhilesh Yadav has, however, decided to directly ask for more time.

There are so many items to sort through, there are so many formalities to be carried out. Will need to finalise a new home, right now nobody is giving me a house on rent thinking they will never give the rent. Once a new house is finalised, will need to get address changed on all our Aadhar Cards and other documents, all these things take a lot of time.”

“I am not saying I will never vacate, I am just saying that by the time Rahul Ji becomes PM, I would have sorted out all these things and on the day he takes oath, I will call a Tata 407 to take our belongings to the new house”, the former CM added.

Virar Locals are known for their passengers filling up the train, train roofs, train doors and almost every inch of space available in the train. Today morning, it was announced by the Congress party that they will put the MLAs in a Virar local as soon as possible and the MLAs have already started their journey towards Mumbai.

According to Biplab, school students should be recruited for this job and not the college students. This will save a lot of useful manpower to be wasted and also train the school kids for the journey ahead. IT companies can also do some cost-cutting as recruitment from schools would make them do away with the lengthy recruitment process.

Several resorts in neighboring Goa have already been booked by these parties to hide their MLAs in case of a hung assembly. The idea is to stop Amit Shah from poaching them and forming a BJP Government in such a scenario. A number of resorts have been booked to make sure Amit Shah and BJP top brass don’t figure out the exact location where MLAs are kept before government formation.

Confirming the news, a Karnataka Congress leader said,” We don’t want a repeat of Goa or Manipur or Meghalaya where we emerge as the single largest party only for BJP to put together enough MLAs to form the government. We are confident that we will get majority on our own but even if we don’t, it is good to be prepared for any eventuality. Hiding the MLAs worked for us during Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections and we are going to do the same this time. Since the stakes are higher, we don’t even want Amit Shah to find out the location where our MLAs will be hiding so we have booked several resorts and MLAs will be kept in any one of those.”

Hoteliers in Goa are very happy with this development as number of tourists decreases significantly during the peak summer months of May and June but now thanks to political tourism, several resorts have been booked for weeks in advance.

Reacting to this step by Congress, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said,” In case there is a hung assembly, we know what we have to do. Even if Congress hides their MLAs at the bottom of the potholes in Bengaluru roads, we will find them and get them to support a BJP government.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/amit-shah-pti_650x400_51518963643.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/resorts-goa-already-booked-congress-jds-protect-future-mlas-amit-shah-26341,Resorts in Goa already booked by Congress and JDS to protect future MLAs from Amit Shah,,1525409627.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mr. Agarwal added, “Apart from hygiene, we do not have to worry about taste of the food items because person carries his own stuff packed from his favorite hotels and restaurants. Quantity is not a concern as they know how many are coming along with the media people who accompany them.”

“Only the room they need for thirty odd minutes. I have the team who can vacuum clean the room and make it ready in fifteen minutes ahead of their visit. What they need is few chattais to sit.

Mr. Siddaramaiah has said that the team may be suffering because a North Indian leader is at the head of the team instead of a local leader from Karnataka.

Speaking to the media after a political rally today, the Karnataka CM said,” Be it politics or Cricket, we really must reject North Indian imports. They don’t understand the situation on ground, the local conditions, the local challenges, and then they end up under-performing. Kohli has been leading the team for so many years but has failed to deliver the IPL trophy. It is about time we give a local lad a chance to see what he can do.”

When pointed out that there is only one Karnataka player in the entire RCB squad, he said,” So captain is also only one, right? Get Pavan Deshpande in the team and make him the captain. If Virat Kohli wants to contribute to a local side, he can always contribute with his bat but leader of the pack should be a Kannadiga only. If they think Deshpande is not good enough to get in the team, at least make AB de Villers the captain, he at least comes from the south, South Africa.”

However, what made the news wasn’t the fast itself but the Chhole-Bhature consumed by his colleagues before the fast. While people forgot even the reason for the fast, everyone remembered Chhole-Bhature.

As the images of Chhole-Bhature circulated all over social media, the demand for this item rose sharply across all the restaurants in Delhi. To capitalize on this popularity, a halwai in Chandni Chowk has launched a special range of Chhole-Bhature that can be consumed before any fast.

The special ‘fast waale chhole-bhature’ are guaranteed to save you from hunger for the next 24 hours, thus ensuring that your fast is successful. Speaking to Faking News, the halwai said, “Since yesterday afternoon, there has been a huge demand for chhole-bhature at our shop with several people asking especially for the fast waala version. Initially I kept telling them that there is no separate version for fasts but then, I saw the opportunity there. We prepared a special plate of Chhole-Bhature that was guaranteed to stuff your stomach so much that you won’t feel hungry for the next 24 hrs.”

“Initial response to the sample dish was very good with the first 5 customers who tried it going into a food coma. As you know, once in coma, the person doesn’t feel hungry so their fast can be a success. After this positive start, we formally launched these chhole-bhature today and the sales have been very good. Now if anyone wants to fast, any kind of fast, they can consume these chhole-bhature from our shop before starting the fast and then they can proceed to Jantar-Mantar, Ramlila Maidaan, India Gate or Rajghat for their fast,” he further added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-mulls-bouncers-parliament-stop-mps-frequent-walkouts-26079,"Concerned about frequent walkouts by MPs, Govt is now planning to have bouncers inside the Parliament to address the issue. These bouncers will be placed at the exits of both houses of the Parliament and they will have the power to stop anyone from leaving the house.

The current session of the Parliament has hardly seen any constructive work with frequent adjournments. “The only time we have them all sitting quietly is when we discuss pay hike of MPs,” said an observer.

Before narrowing down on bouncers, Govt had considered other options such as ordering pizza, screening of cricket matches and so on to quell the ruckus in the house. “Nothing seemed to have worked. So the only option left was to use the services of a bouncer,” said a source close to the development.

The decision evoked mixed reaction from Parliamentarians. Opposition parties thought that the decision was harsh and severe and infringed on their right to expression. “Arre ye koi pub hai kya ki yaha bouncer rakhiyega. Jab marshall hai Parliament mein toh bouncer ki kya zaroorat. Sarkaar ko humse maafi maangni chahiye,” screamed an opposition MP.

No sooner he finished saying this, the MP got an sms which read ‘Maafi mai maangoonga. Shaam tak likh kar bhejta hu – AAPka Arvind Kejriwal’.

Meanwhile, the entire contingent of Opposition parties is planning to raise this issue in the next session and said that they will carry pepper spray to deal with anyone who stops them from walking out.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cong-parliament.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-mulls-bouncers-parliament-stop-mps-frequent-walkouts-26079,Govt mulls having bouncers in Parliament to stop MPs from frequent walkouts,,1522830560.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Earlier this month, Sambit had requested Republic TV editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami, to allow him some space in the office premises so that he can shift there permanently along with his family members. It was a real pain for Sambit to commute daily during peak hours in the terrible traffic conditions. In fact Sambit, who works like and shows the punctuality of a corporate employee has opted for the work from home option at the BJP headquarters.

Traffic is a big problem in a metro like Mumbai and it makes sense for more and more employees to work from home instead of clogging the roads. Sambit realized the fact that he spends more time in the Republic studios than his own home and so it is like his home. BJP members also recognize the importance of Sambit defending government’s decisions on prime time television. Sambit will inspire many other spokespersons from different parties to start working from the news channels which are their favorite.

Confirming the news, Sambit said, “It took me a lot of time and effort to travel to Republic TV studio for the debate every day. Arnab and I belong to the same party… oops! I mean, we go to a lot of parties together. So, he had to do me a favor by giving me and my family some space in his office. After all, I have been the most consistent thing on the debate after the noise.”

Meanwhile, the spokespersons of the Congress party who had allegedly boycotted the Republic TV debates were seen queuing outside the news channel’s office. One of the spokespersons said, “With the high rates of property in Mumbai, it is really difficult to find an appropriate house in the city. We are ready to appear in Republic TV debates again if Arnab allows us to stay in his office like he allowed Sambit,” he said. He clarified that he will not be bringing his family along with him to the office.

Now that Sambit has set an example for the other spokesperson, we can just hope that he inspires a current lot of corporate employees too.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/maxresdefault-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sambit-patra-opts-work-home-option-bjp-will-seen-8-hrs-day-republic-news-debates-26069,"Sambit Patra opts for ‘work from home’ option, will be seen 8 hrs a day on Republic news debates",,1522736153.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

This now temporarily ends Laloo Prasad Yadav’s political career. In South Africa though, chief executive David Richardson laid the charge against Australia captain Steve Smith that eventually led to the latter being handed a one-match ban and 100% fine of the match fee. This has been looked upon to be very lenient punishment for the Australian captain.

RJD leaders were sure that Laloo would surely like to appeal to the higher court, but looking at the judgment in the ball tampering case, Laloo now wants his court case to be shifted to the ICC panel. Laloo has also drafted the advantages of international judgment. According to him, 1) ICC is an international body, so there will be no bias towards any politician. 2) The judgment will be delivered in a speedy way just like the Steve Smith case. 3) SO many court cases are pending in Indian courts and it will give a relief to the already burdened courts.

Looking at Laloo’s request, many politicians like A.raja, P Chidabaram, Madhu Koda and others have requested the government to pass a bill which will make it mandatory for all cases involving politicians to be fought in the ICC. This looks like a revenue generation opportunity for ICC which can charge the Indian judiciary for every verdict delivered by the panelists. It has to be seen as to how seriously the law minister and other senior government ministers take this requests.

No News debate panel is complete without the presence of Mr. Sambit Patra. But then he has only 24 hours in a day just like all of us. So to be present on TV channels in a day has become pretty tough for Sambit. And that is the reason he has hired a personal spokesperson to propagate his views on shows where he won’t be physically present.

Sambit has been getting invitations from all news channels to put BJP’s point of view on the shows, and he has been punctual in almost all of them. Some days back he even created the record of being on 16 channels in a single day. But the hectic work schedule is taking a toll on his body. A few days back he missed being on a new channel because he was on a show on some other news channel. He really felt bad after not keeping the commitment with one channel. So much so that, yesterday he announced in a press conference that he has hired a spokesperson who would help him keep all commitments.

To hire the spokesperson Sambit held a tough selection process. The process started with an essay writing competition, debate competition, a running race to see if the person reaches all channels on time and also a shouting competition where a competitor has to shout at loudest of his voice. After all the rounds were completed a personal interview with Sambit was the final round and that is how Mr. Shwetank Srivastava was selected as the official spokesperson of Sambit Patra.

It is yet to be seen as to which news debate will Shwetank make his debut with, but what will be more interesting to see is whether he will create the same magic as Sambit does.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BeFunky-Collage-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sambit-patra-hires-spokesperson-not-able-reach-news-debates-simultaneously-25991,Sambit Patra hires a spokesperson as he was not able to reach all news debates simultaneously,,1521784307.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah being welcomed by congress workers during the inauguration of various developmental works of BBMP at Shankar Mutt ward, Kurubarahalli in Bangalore on Wednesday. –KPN ### CM inaugurates BBMP developmental works

The reason is before election dates are announced by EC and model code of conduct comes in to effect, CM and his team wants to complete all the ‘development’ activities they had assured voters five years back when they came to power.

The ‘Pundit’ was gathering his own stuff to leave the place after Bhumi Pujan when authorities asked him to stay back and complete the puja for the inauguration of the underpass. Shell shocked Pundit asked his assistant to get the book to do the puja related to completion of the project from his residence quickly. Government officials arranged a special vehicle and made sure traffic movement is well-coordinated so that the assistant reaches the spot before ‘auspicious time’ marked for the ceremony.

Why we will repeat the same mistake and give BJP ‘another’ chance to claim credit in case they come to power. So, in the cabinet meeting we decided whatever ‘state’ the projects are, we will inaugurate them”.

A month after Kamalhaasan has announced his political party’s name, Rajnikanth now announces the date on which the date for announcing the name will be announced. The fundamental difference between the two newborn leaders lies in the color of the symbol of the party, it is believed by the political analysts in the state.

While Kamal Hassan’s party has a symbol of enjoined hands with black, white and red, indicating a left leaning, Thalaiva’s party is expected to have Saffron as the colour, indicating a right leaning, it is learnt by Faking News. The fans are in no rush as they have waited for 20 years for the announcement on whether there will be a party. Now they are more than pleased to wait just 2 years to get to know the name of the party, it is further learnt by Faking News.

“None of us have expected that our beloved leader actually would announce a political party and encourage us to participate in the Assembly Elections. We really do not need a name now; actually being anonymous is more charming than something like maiam. All we need is an MLA seat in our new party. If the legend is to become true, the election commission will extend the name, the symbol and the office building to our party” a die hard fan of super star told Faking News, suppressing a smile and taking a dig at the newly announced Kamal Hassan’s party.

“Until the next Assembly Elections, no one is going to question the actor on his entry into politics. Now he is free to do more movies acting as hero at the age of 67. The movies are bound to run well given the added popularity with the political entry and everything. He is not just a smart politician; he is actually more smart to use politics to make his movies run better. If Kaala fails at box office then the party’s name will immediately be announced. If 2.0 fails at box office then there will not be any party” a political analyst took a strong critical view on the super star’s political tactics.

Did he get his timing wrong?

Earlier in the day, Samajwadi Party defeated Bharatiya Janata Party in its stronghold of Gorakhpur and also in Phulpur bypoll. These elections were held after current Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM KP maurya had to vacate their seats after getting elected to the state assembly.

When someone reminded Mr. Agarwal that he had joined BJP just a couple of days back, he said ,”This is typical media tactic of misquoting politicians. I never said that I was joining BJP, I just said that I was going to BJP’s headquarters for a party and you guys made it sound like I am joining their party, there is nothing like that. I am a proud member of Samajwadi Party and will continue to work for them.”

When another journalist pointed out that he is on video talking about joining BJP, he said ,”I am standing here and telling you that I have not joined BJP and you want to talk about some video?

Commenting on this development, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said ,”Of course if Mulayam Singh ji wants to come then he is most welcome to BJP. We have always welcomed leaders from Samajwadi Party with open arms since these are 2 very like-minded parties. Therefore, a Samajwadi leader is a natural fit in BJP.

“Our president’s personal life is totally separate from his public life. However, our party’s leadership is very important to us. When Soniaji was Congress president, we were not worried about future leadership. Rahulji was waiting to take over. With our leader remaining as the most eligible bachelor in the country, we have no choice but to interfere in his personal life and ask him to get married soon,” one of the long-term party leader told Faking News.

“In the past several years, our party has seen a reluctant president, a reluctant politician, a reluctant vice president and a reluctant prime minister. Now, our new leader is very reluctant to get married. We were reluctant too, at first, to start this signature campaign. Some senior leaders gave us encouragement by signing the petition as the first group to lead the way for others. Indian national Congress always believed in democracy and once our future leader is born, there will be a democratic process to elect him as our president,” a junior leader told Faking News.

Supreme leader gave this warning after learning about the removal of Lenin’s statue in the Indian state of Tripura. After the defeat of CPM in the recent assembly elections, Lenin’s statue was removed by alleged BJP workers yesterday.

Lenin on the way out

Kim Jong Un has been a hero for communists in Kerala and his posters have come up more than once in the state recently. After removal of Lenin’s statue, Kim Jong Un is worried that his posters may become the next target. He thinks a mob of BJP workers may try to burn them or tear them up and he has asked PM Narendra Modi to avoid such a situation else he will launch Nuclear missiles targeting all major Indian cities.

An official DPRK spokesperson said ,”Even though our Supreme Leader is generally a very peaceful man but if some lines are crossed, he gets a little bit angry. Any mob touching his posters will be crossing that line and then India will have to pay. Our Nuclear missiles are already ready for an attack and we will just have to change the target from Donald Trump’s Golf Course to Indian cities. Comrade Lenin was not around to defend himself so they could remove his statue but Supreme Leader is still around and will not tolerate anyone messing with his posters.”

Meanwhile, CPM promised to erect a giant statue of Lenin outside the Parliament after winning the next elections, a joke that was well received by all the parliamentarians present there.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tripura-lenin.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/will-launch-nuclear-attack-india-anyone-touched-posters-kerala-kim-jong-un-25853,Will launch Nuclear attack on India if anyone touched my posters in Kerala: Kim Jong Un,,1520333779.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An FIR filed by the CBI on May 15 last year had alleged irregularities in the FIPB clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007. It is alleged Karti had received funds to the tune of Rs 10 lakh in the case. However, Mr. Chidambaram’s lawyers have called the entire case bogus and alleged that fake allegations have been leveled against their client.

Who takes a bribe of 10 lakhs?

A lawyer representing Karthi Chidambaram said ,”It is absolutely ridiculous, they are saying that the son of the then Finance Minister accepted only 10 lakhs as the bribe? What is he, a Junior Engineer in the municipal office of a remote town? Add to that the fact that our client is a politician in his own right and even contested Lok Sabha elections once. This stature entitles a politician to a minimum bribe of 100 Crores and they are making a case of 10 lakhs? Which self respecting politician will accept a bribe of 10 lakhs? What greater proof is needed to show that this is just a witch hunt and the entire case is false.”

However, BJP has rubbished the allegations that this is a politically motivated arrest. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Karthi’s lawyers are trying to mislead the nation by saying the amount is too low for a political bribe. We have seen senior politicians willing to accept even 1 lakh as a bribe in the past. Every drop counts, 10 lakh bribes of 10 lakhs each will make the whole amount politically acceptable or not?”

Speaking to the press, Mr. Haris said ,”Seasoned politicians from every party know that politicians can only assault toll booth workers without facing any consequences.

However, my immature son was yet to learn this very important political lesson. He ended up assaulting a person in a pub, in a pub! Everyone knows that anything done in a pub generates maximum outrage in this country, everyone except my son obviously.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bored-amit-shah-criticises-ec-asks-no-elections-held-january-25089,"After winning the Gujarat Legislative Assembly Elections in 2017, multimillionaire Jay Shah’s father cum BJP President Amit Shah’s confidence is at an all-time high. The proud father, who is the most active during elections and encounters, recently took a jibe at the Election Commission (EC) for not conducting any elections in January.

A bored Shah questioned the EC for its non-functioning during January. “The EC is behaving like a government employee—it works for four months and spends the remaining eight months taking a rest,” he said. Shah further questioned his existence if no elections are being contested, “If no elections are held, what are politicians like me elected for? For public welfare?” he asked, before realising that he was elected as the party president without an election.

Reportedly, Rahul Gandhi’s elevation as party president is giving Shah restless nights. After the Gujarat Elections scare, Shah does not want to take any chance and lose a state. “Narendra bhai and I started discussing the next election even before the results of the Gujarat Elections were out,” he said. “Hence, we want the elections soon, so that the Congress party does not get time to devise a strategy.”

The Chief Electoral Officer criticised Shah’s way of questioning the EC. In a press conference held to give a fitting reply to Shah, he said, “We will use EVMs to decide when the elections should be held, before they can be used again during the elections. And this time around, the EVMs will not help any specific party. Beat that, Shah!”

Congress President Rahul Gandhi hinted of a political vendetta behind the unfavourable voting results. He said, “The EVMs can be hacked. We don’t trust the EC despite the introduction of the VVPAT machines. I appeal to the EC to allow me to stand next to the voter while s/he casts the vote and ensure that the elections are fair.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amit-chankya.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bored-amit-shah-criticises-ec-asks-no-elections-held-january-25089,"Bored Amit Shah criticises EC, asks why no elections are held in January",,1515781168.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“The book is going to be on high demand. I want to bring about good reading habits among commoners in our country. People who had earlier thought our country had lost about one lakh and seventy six thousand crores, will now learn that they have not lost anything, by paying only Rs. 250. The unfolding has been carefully narrated as a thriller novel and people are going to just love this book,” A Raja sounded too confident, talking to Faking News on his upcoming book, expected to top the charts of best sellers.

“People told me to release the book as an e-book, with premium pricing. I have strongly decided that the book will be sold on a first come first served basis. Also, I have decided to sell the book in bulk to a few choice resellers. The first few resellers who approach me will get the books in bulk and they can resell the book in the Indian subcontinent. I strongly deny the rumours that one or more book companies have offered bribes to me to release the books in their favour. I particularly deny the fact that a vegetable and fruit company has transferred 200 thousands as a gift for me to sell the entire first print to them,” A Raja talked about his first come first served policy.

“I am the hero. A certain CAG is the villain. Several comedians are there throughout the movie, including the publisher who once rejected my script and sent me away and finally he himself agreed to release my handy work. The character artists are several too, including a few low profile holders of high profile offices. Twist in the tale comes when the hero comes out of jail to take revenge on the people who had set him up,” he further added on the storyline of the book ‘2G Saga Unfolds’.

The Delhi CM is facing a lot of heat ever since AAP announced its 3 Rajya Sabha members, particularly from his own party member, Kumar Vishwas, who was overlooked in favor of ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta. To resolve the situation, he has now approached PM Modi who has a long experience of dealing with a fellow party member criticizing his every move.

Sir how to handle our Shatrughan?

Confirming the news, an AAP insider said ,”Well, Kumar Vishwas Ji is obviously unhappy as you can see from his statements since we announced our Rajya Sabha candidates but there is no sign of him leaving the party. Arvind Ji also doesn’t want to expel him from the party and this has created a very awkward situation. As a new party, we don’t have much experience in dealing with such a situation but obviously BJP has similar situation with Shatrughan Sinha Ji criticizing everything BJP leadership does, in fact, Shatrughan Ji goes a step ahead and keeps praising opposition leaders in Bihar making the situation even more awkward and yet, they seem to be handling the situation easily.So no harm in seeking their guidance on this issue.”

When asked about the history of enmity between Kejriwal and Modi, he said ,”In politics, there are no permanent friends and no permanent enemies. Anyway it is not as if we are entering into an alliance with BJP, this is just a young leader seeking guidance from a veteran. Hopefully, Modi Ji will share his expertise on the subject and help us out.”

In a bizarre announcement, Censor Board tells Lalu to drop a vowel from the name for the courts to possibly reduce his prison term. Lalu prasad yadav readily agreed to change his name to Lal prasad yadav, after learning about Padmavati to be released after changing name to Padmavat. Similar to the movie, he now demands to be released, or the jail term be reduced, it is learnt by Faking News.

Twitterati started cracking jokes on the name change by CBFC of the film Padmavati to Padmavat. One joke said, ‘Both Sanjay Leela Bansal and Prasoon Josh are happy about Padmavat, and they hope this compromise is acceptable to Narendra Mod and Rahul Gandh’. Another one said, ‘So Bhansali can now actually throw a party. Just that Whisky will be called ‘Whiska’ Vodka will be called ‘Vodki’ and so on’. And another one read ‘If Padman picks up the ‘i’ that Padmavat drops, they’ll have to call it ‘Padmani’.

None of the jokes came anywhere closer to the thunderous announcement by the RJD leader, to change his name to Lal to be released from the jail. “If a name change is all it takes to get something released in India, I am ready to play by the rules and will drop U to get myself released” the leader apparently told one of the several visitors, it is learnt by Faking News. “Padmavati would not have any cuts after the name change. But, I already had my cut long before this name change” Mr. Lal, in his changed name, smiled broadly, the visitor had further described about the meeting with the leader.

After Lalu’s announcement, now Ram Rahim Gurmeet Singh has agreed to drop several letters from his name, if all the charges are dropped and if he too can be released from the jail.

“For 3 generations, our family has been superstar fans. For 3 generations, we have waited for our Thalaivar to announce his political entry and we are prepared to wait for 1 more generation.

“For every new year, we now will wait for that one letter from the Thalaivar. What does the world think of our leader? The entry will always be very dramatic. When my grandson hears the last letter of the party, I will rest in peace in heaven, that the state of Tamilnadu is in good hands. As far Thalaivar, he is eternal. He would have probably finished 10.0 starring opposite Deepika Padukone’s grand daughter” another ardent fan told Faking News.

And the party has promised that with the donation they receive, they will construct a proper donation office with latest technology to keep proper records of the donations. Now this really is innovative thinking at its best. The current donations are not being tracked properly leaving too much room for malpractices.

From its inception, AAP has projected itself as an austerity driven organization, which spends only the amount which is required. Constructing a donation office from taxpayers money would be gross injustice to the hard earned money of citizens, so it makes sense that voluntary donations be converted to the required infrastructure. Kejriwal has urged people to come out in numbers and donate for this noble cause, because the current donations will make the future donations more transparent and trustworthy.

There was a long queue outside AAP office today with people coming in large numbers and donating money for this noble cause. Currently as no gadgets or computers are used to record the donations, Kejriwal is himself giving selfies with the donor to keep it as future record in case of discrepancy. Now this is so humble of the Delhi CM, if only the other CMs in the country were so thoughtful about the taxpayer’s money.

Judge OPK Swani, in illustrated career, has given nothing but clean chits, citing highly innovative reasons and highly flawed arithmetic calculations, it is further learnt by Faking News.

The first time OPK Swani’s judgement had become a butt of jokes, when he had asked a thief to act according to his consciences and let him walk free. Then there was a disproportionate case, where he calculated the excess wealth of a corrupt politician with erroneous calculations. Those two judgements have since been included in creative writing courses in 5 Indian universities.

Then, the criminal cases followed. CBI had prepared 8000 pages of charge sheet in one case. OPK Swani sold the entire bundle of papers for half a kilogram of dates and allowed everyone involved to walk free. In the same case, when CBI had proven beyond doubt that 200 crores were transferred as bribe from a fruit company to a TV channel, the judge simply dismissed the transaction as a mega advertising fee, for enhancing fruit eating habits of Indian public.

After learning about OPK Swani’s unmatched skills on giving out clean chits, a lot of men and women in exile have returned back to India to get clean chits.

In an exclusive, Faking News came to know that Rahul Gandhi chose to eat Nachos while watching the film instead of going for the more popular popcorn.

Nachos khaane ke baad muskurata ye neta

Speaking to Faking News on the condition of anonymity, an employee at the multiplex said ,”When Rahul Ji arrived to see the film, at first I thought they have converted this cinema hall into a temple but later I realized that he has come to see the film. I immediately filled up a big bucket of popcorn and offered it to him but he declined. I thought I have done something wrong but then he said he will take Nachos. I wanted to video record this incredible development but it was not possible for me to do it while standing right in front of him.”

BJP has already hit out at Rahul Gandhi for this act. party spokesperson Sambit Patra said ,”This just goes to show why Rahul Gandhi can’t relate to the majority of the people in this country. he should have picked popcorn to experience what the majority experiences but his elitist mindset led to his choice of Nachos.”

Congress has reacted sharply to Mr. Patra’s comments with the party saying that popcorn prices have risen so high under PM Modi that even Rahul Gandhi can no longer afford to buy them.

Meanwhile, a news channel has managed to access the CCTV footage showing Rahul Gandhi accepting the plate of Nachos and political experts agree that this footage will cost Congress 2019 elections.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rahul-tw.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/faking-news-exclusive-rahul-gandhi-preferred-nachos-popcorn-watching-star-wars-24711,Faking News Exclusive: Rahul Gandhi preferred Nachos to Popcorn while watching Star Wars,,1513759168.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

.

Even after bringing series of quarterfinal, semifinal election victories for BJP in last three and half years, media have started debating whether Modi can do it again? Does he have the charisma to win the ‘biggest’ semifinal before the ‘final’ 2019 general election.

“As this all-important state election would happen just a year before the general election, PM does not want to take any chance. Moreover, he is dissatisfied with BJP’s performance in Gujrat election. It was so close”, said one BJP national secretary who has been assigned to supervise the state election.

“For us to win, if he has to address more than two hundred public meetings, so be it. We will leave no stones unturned in arranging that”, said BJP secretary who has already started working with PMO and Amit Shah to ensure PM’s calendar remains free at least 4 months before the first vote is cast in the state.

“Today when I went to meet him to congratulate on two fantastic election victories we had today, he asked me to arrange meetings in such a way that he can connect with each voter of the state personally”, said the BJP secretary.

After news started tickling that PM will ‘take care’ of the next year state election, many state BJP leaders were planning to head towards a posh resort near Bengaluru to ‘celebrate’ the moment.

“It’s Christmas and New Year time. We all want to have some fun. Anyway, lot of work will come on our way once PM Modi wins the election for us next year. Tab kahan time milega aisse relax karne ke liye.

Probably the most high-profile seat in which Nota exceeded the victory margin was Porbandar, where Congress’s Arjunbhai Modhwadia lost by 1,855 votes to BJP’s Babubhai Bokhiriya, his longstanding rival. Nota picked up 3,433 votes in this seat. The importance of the NOTA button is for everyone to see. And so Faking News did a survey on who these people are and what is their mindset like.

Most of the people seem to be the ones who spend a lot of time thinking for no reason. Like going to a fast food store with limited options and still taking 5-10 minutes to think as to what to order. So basically the result is the same and they get the option they selected, but the time and effort spent is bit too much. I mean the whole purpose of a fast food joint is to make it easy for you to order which could have been done by sitting at home too, but these people take lot of time in thinking, then verifying. We even got a person, who after pressing the NOTA button confirmed twice with the EC official as to if his vote was delivered successfully. NOTA is a good initiative, but at the end of the day if the NOTA voters are not significant in numbers it cannot impact the result in a constituency.

People opting for NOTA should rather not go for voting as they eat up time during which a genuine voter could have exercised his voting rights. Though at a later stage even NOTA will play a substantial role in deciding the anger and anti establishment sentiments among the voters.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NOTAa.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/people-voting-nota-ones-take-5-minutes-decide-order-fast-food-joint-research-24693,People voting NOTA are the ones who take 5 minutes to decide their order at a fast food joint: Research,,1513673316.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A delegation led by state election in-charge for the party, Ashok Gehlot, met the Governor a short while back and staked their claim. This step has surprised many people as BJP looks set to get a clear majority with around 100 seats as per the latest information from Election Commission.

So, who won?

Speaking to Faking News, a senior member of the Congress party said ,”It is obvious that we will stake the claim after winning a great victory in Gujarat. You can see so many channels, so many political pundits calling the verdict a big win for Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Ji is Congress President, hence it is a win for us. Governor himself should have called us to form the government but its ok, maybe he got busy elsewhere so we have reached him to place our claim in front of him.”

When we mentioned that BJP seems to be winning more number of seats, he said ,”I don’t think you quite understand democracy. Whose verdict will be respected in the end, Election Commission’s or Political Pundit’s? When political pundits have called the election then whatever EC does after that is irrelevant.”

In fact sources say that he was kept under house arrest with his mouth taped to stop any comments from him.

In fact the initial trends today showed us that the Congress move was in fact correct. Keeping Mani Shankar out of public life was working for them. But as more and more trends started coming in, the writing was on the wall and a Congress defeat is what looks imminent. Finally the Congress leadership thinks that Mani Shankar cannot do any further damage and its safe to make him free. The tape from his mouth has been taken off and his house arrest is also relaxed now. But what’s surprising is the queue of BJP leaders seen outside Aiyar’s house. The leaders were seen having boxes of ‘Ladoos’ in their hands. Most BJP workers think that Aiyar had a major role to play in this emphatic win.

According to the sources, all BJP leaders who were not present outside Aiyar’s house had given him a call in the morning, thanking him for his immense contribution in their victory.

Nagar residents need not submit income proof for loans, banks in Chennai have declared after the declaration of by-election by the Election Commission. The residents who are eligible to apply for the loans are eligible to vote and therefore will be rich in cash, the local banks have reasoned with the promotional offer.

The personal loans are normally approved for salaried people with good credit score. Also, for the businessmen with enough assets as collateral. When it comes to an election constituency in Tamilnadu, every adult with voting rights is exempted from the eligibility screening. Especially in R.K. Nagar, the personal loans have no ceiling, it is learnt by Faking News.

“The beauty of a Socialist Republic is to make all her citizens feel rich. Being the most populous democracy in the world, we make all our citizens feel extremely rich, during elections. Cash for vote is almost a thing of past now. Everything for vote is the new rule of democracy. In R.K. Nagar, there are as many as 25 techniques used to distribute gifts for votes. So, the residents have 25 options to pay back the loan to us. We are not worried. These are our golden customers and this is a golden season” one of the bank officials told Faking News.

“Per capita income of an average Indian is 10 times lesser compared to that of people living in a constituency where elections are announced. The spirits of true democracy is exhibited only during the elections. All are treated equal and the cash reaches everyone without fail, unlike other government schemes.

The BJP thinks that the Congress is cooking up this story because it knows that it is losing the Assembly elections. A total of 89 constituencies went to polls on Saturday, in the first phase, in Saurashtra, Kutch and South Gujarat. But the election commission has carified that EVM hacking is not possible, and to strengthen their point they have installed a new technology into all EVMs. Votes will be considered genuine only when the person voting has posted a selfie with his colored finger on Facebook and for this to happen the EC has tied up with Facebook.

This solution will enable EC to be double sure about the transparency of the voting. EVMs are being fitted with WiFi chips which will make them connect to the internet. The software will do face recognition of the person who is voting and will check his Facebook page after 10 minutes of the voting. If it is able to detect the selfie with colored finger the vote will be counted as genuine or else the vote will be considered as bogus.

EC has hired 100 engineers to make the plan a success. Students from engineering colleges are hired on a contract basis and this has come as a boon for the tier 2 and 3 colleges who have difficulty placing their students in to good companies.

The bogey of ‘faulty EVMs’ first surfaced after BJP’s massive electoral success in Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. And recently during the first round of elections in Gujarat, one of the Congress MLA conveyed that EVMs are being connected to WiFi and Bluetooth. Given India’s fast progress in the field of technology, it may not come as a surprise that even the EVMs can be connected to the outer world. But the rumour which is spreading across the state is that the EVM works like a hotspot and gives free internet, which is making people reach election booths in numbers and also cast their vote.

According to the Election Commission 66.74% of voting was recorded in the first round which is a good number and much of the credit should go to the EVM rumor. Rural India still doesn’t have appreciable internet penetration and people are always on the lookout for free internet through open hotspots or at railway stations. At major election booths people not only cast their votes, but also stayed near the booth throughout the day to try and collect internet signals sent from the EVMs. Though it was a disappointing experience for the people, the large voter turnaround helped the democratic process of India.

Faking News reporter caught up with one such person named Jagdish Jain and he had this to say,” Mobile internet packages are still out of our financial reach, so we are always on the lookout of free internet.

At one booth EVM was seen to catch WiFi and Bluetooth signals.

After the news of EVM getting WiFi and internet signals went viral, Vodafone sales team approached EVM manufacturer with an undeniable offer of worth hundred thousand crores. Vodafone is currently getting a lot of complaints for its poor internet signals, and seeing competition from Jio and Airtel, company is ready to go to any extent to stay in the competition.

In a similar incident, AAP leader Manish Sisodia accused Modi govt of hacking EVMs. Faking News reporter spoke to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on the issue. Sambit Patra said “Look these are all false allegations, and if in case EVMs are actually getting WiFi signals then also it’s victory of Modi govt as it shows that Vikas has actually happened in Gujarat”. Sambit further added “If Arvind Kejriwal ji knows that EVM can be hacked through WiFi and still he’s not installing free Wi-Fi, it shows how non-serious he is.”

Election Commission has rejected all the accusations of EVM catching WiFi signals and has given strict warning to rumor mongers after which many journalists were seen deleting their posts and tweets. One of the EC officers clarified that EVM is a standalone and can’t be connected to any network and to kill even the remotest possibility of it getting connected to any network EC will talk to Chinese phone manufacturer to manufacture EVMs too.

Any such incident of spreading rumor not only dents Democracy but also creates mistrust among voters.

“I don’t trade with animals except horses. For heaven’s sake, I don’t trade my cattle. My horses fetch me good bargain year after year. People within my own party admit that I am the best in the business when it comes to horse-trading. Quite often, the media and the opposition use my business against me, calling me being involved in horse-trading in a negative sense,” the minister told Faking News.

“It is unfortunate in India that the entire political game is limited to a few phrases. Vendetta politics, horse-trading, political realignment, coalition, outside support, issue-based support etc., And then there are gates. Any scam, small or big is always suffixed with a gate. It is sickening really, to have a few hundred ScamGates. With this limited phrases and vocabulary, a few honest businessmen in politics like me are affected,” he further added.

When asked if he ever was involved in negotiating with MLAs for any kind of support, the minister denied the charges immediately. “No. Never. I mean I might have hosted my party MLAs in the farmhouse once or twice during political instability in our state or in the other states. Coincidentally, horse-trading might have happened in my farm with my horses, at the same time. But, nothing to do with MLAs being there,” he cleared the accusations by the media and the opposition.

The horse-trading done by the minister is always in the range of a few crores, an insider from the farmhouse told Faking News, on the condition of anonymity.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/horse.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/minister-accused-horse-trading-actually-trading-horses-farm-says-police-report-22427,"Minister accused of horse-trading was actually trading horses from his farm, says police report",,1501907225.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

But the BJP leaders were not worried by this allegation as they thought Nitish genuinely has respect for the BJP. It was only after today mornin’s cabinet meeting that BJP leaders are a worried lot. Actually Nitish praised some BJP ministers in todays meeting and that has made BJP leaders believe that Nitish will sonn break the alliance.

In last 20-30 days, Nitish had praised the ministers in the mahagatbandhan, and members of the alliance were feeling quite safe. But they had not realized that Nitish will dump them the way he did. BJP leaders have observed a pattern in Nitish’s U-turns, Nitish works with his colleagues, and when he thinks its time to break alliance, he praises the ministers and the next day he breaks alliance.

Nitish Kumar praising the BJP cabinet ministers has gone down well with Lalu, as Lalu is extremely sure that Nitish will come back to him if not soon than later. The BJP ministers who were praised by Nitish in the meeting are also in a state of confusion as they know that they have worked only for 4 days and have not done any substantial work which is praiseworthy. Nitish Kumar’s praise are like Karan Johar’s praise for respective colleagues, one doesn’t know if it is genuine or just for the sake of it. Faking News reporter caught up with a JDU party member who said, ” There is nothing to worry about. Before breaking Alliance, Nitishji will convey us 10-20 minutes before taking the decision, and all media houses will be called for the pres release.

Recently, Bihar also got Modi-fied when JDU leader and CM of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, did a coalition with BJP to form a new government in the state. Almost every day, Congress’ MLAs are moving to BJP and it seems Congress has no control over its own MLAs.

Rahul confident that his idea will stop defections

In order to stop this movement, Congress Vice President, Rahul Gandhi, has devised a method that has been appreciated by many political pundits and scientists. Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that GPS chips will be installed in Congress’ MLAs to track their movement.

While political strategist, Prashant Kishore has called it the biggest reform of UPA, CM Arvind Kejriwal has called it useless. Arvind Kejriwal said, “I am an engineer, GPS chips can be hacked, fir GPS chip location kahin ki bhi dikhaye MLA jayenge BJP me hi. I myself know more than 10 methods of hacking GPS chips.”

Many senior journalists have called it, “Rahul Gandhi Coming Of Age.” Congress Spokesperson Mr. Sanjay Jha is not getting tired praising Rahul Gandhi. Sanjay Jha said Rahul Gandhi is what digital India means not what Modi is trying to do.

Union minister and BJP leader, Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Rahul Gandhi of breaching privacy of his MLA and called it a stupid idea.

If this idea gets implemented then it will not remain limited to politicians, tomorrow employers too will install GPS chips in their employees to know employees’ current location.

The ruckus created by opposition on matters of Lynching, horse trading of MLAs and other issues has not allowed the lower house to function efficiently. SO mush so that speaker Sumitra Mahajan had to issue a threat in the house saying that she will invite Arnab Goswami as a guest speaker if the MPs don’t stay quiet. And to her surprise, there was a pin drop silence and functioning improved.

Arnab has been a nightmare for the political class and people generally don’t have the courage to speak when he is conducting a debate. His debates are started by him, carried forward by him and even concluded by him, and similar situation is required in the parliament for passing of many important bills and laws. Sumitra Mahajan, who has tried her level best in controlling the aggressive MPs, sometimes even suspending some of them, felt that the last resort would be to invite ARnab for a day. Hearing the threat from the speaker, most of the MPs apologized for their behavior and promised that they will never shout in their life.

Even the ruling MPs of the BJP stayed quiet and din’t celebrate the silence as they knew that facing Arnab is a tough task for them too. As soon as Arnab heard about the proceedings in the Lok Sabha, he has been busy preparing the list of topics he can debate inside the parliament. According to him, an opportunity may arise soon and he should be thoroughly prepared with his content.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-says-congress-gathbhandhan-sp-will-remain-intact-22317,"After the dissolution of RJD and JDU coalition in Bihar, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi made a remark that made him the butt of many jokes. Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said, “Congress’ gathbadhan with

SP in UP is still intact”.

Rahul Gandhi’s remark clearly shows that either he’s unaware about the UP election results or he’s way too optimistic.

After the mighty fall of the Mahagathbandhan of JDU-RJD in Bihar, Rahul was doing a press conference on BJP’s three years of misgovernance. On being asked about Bihar’s political situation affecting other states, Rahul Gandhi misunderstood the question and spoke about UP rather than about those states that have elections scheduled. Rahul Gandhi said, “Nitish Kumar has betrayed people’s mandate in Bihar but we won’t do that in UP. Congress and SP’s mahagathbandhan is intact and Mr. Modi and Amit Shah will not be able to break this”. Rahul further added, “Leave this aside, we still have our coalition with SP”. Obviously everyone thought he was joking but he went on to say, “Akhilesh won’t ever leave the coalition”.

Soon after this, people mocked Rahul Gandhi at will. Even BJP leader Giriraj Singh tweeted that Rahul Gandhi is still not aware about UP elections getting over.

To counter the trolling, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha said, “Rahul Gandhi’s comments were mistaken, he wanted to say his friendship with Akhilesh Yadav will remain intact”. Despite no link to this incident, many Congress supporters are defending Rahul Gandhi with this clarification from Sanjay Jha.

Samajwadi party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said, “I am sad to hear that their friendship will continue. Today our seats are 54, if my son stays in his company till the next elections, then it will reduce to 4 seats”.

Rahul Gandhi remained silent on the entire incident but his supporters (within and outside media) kept defending him.

He is back with the BJP. Other than addressing rallies, attending cabinet meetings and planning new initiatives for the state, one thing which Nitish has done frequently is ‘Oath Taking’. Oath taking ceremonies have become important event in Bihar political circle and now Nitish wants a ministry to handle the oath taking ceremonies.

Many prominent personalities of Indian politics are expected to be present during the oath taking ceremony and it makes sense that there should be a separate ministry which handles all operations related to oath taking ceremonies. Nitish even plans to hire some external consultants who will provide the road map of how such ceremonies should be organized in the best possible way, which in turn would benefit the state tourism. Bihar will start offering tickets at premium price for the common man to attand otha taking function.

Nitish has not yet decided as to who will head the ministry, but it will be given to person who has prior experience in organizing wedding functions, get together and other events of similar scale and size. As for tomorrow’s ceremony is concerned, Bihar government has given the contract to some local vendors in the event management sector. Congress members and RJD members will be personally invited for the event and hey will be given best possible seats at the venue. From next year, obviously, even the venue selection will be done through tenders and money collected through gate pass sales will be used in organizing the next oath taking ceremony.

Government is facing sharp criticism since then. BJP’s spokesperson, Sambit Patra has called it yet another masterstroke by PM Modi and has asked media to be patient.

While many BJP leaders are targeting CAG for releasing such confidential data in public, Spokesperson Sambit Patra is sure that CAG has done it only after consulting PM Modi. Sambit Patra in a news debate said “Congress’ small minds will not be able to understand it, but it’s Modi masterstroke. After CAG’s report on limited ammunition, Pakistan will attack India and then India will defeat Pakistan. Very soon we will see Tri-colour in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore”.

Pakistan Army Chief, Javed Bajwa addressed the media after the CAG report and said “We don’t trust any Indian report, I don’t know what CAG is. I can’t pronounce it but since its Indian I am sure it’s not trustworthy. I appeal to Pakistan Army not to get overexcited with the report, we have already lost a few wars because of our stupidity”

Whether CAG report is a reflection of BJP’s poor defence policy or a masterstroke to confuse Pakistan is yet to be seen, but one thing is clear that it’s not the first time that India media and many other countries are absolutely clueless about various steps taken by our government.

That is to give new and innovative full forms every day on every subject.

“In the cabinet meeting that happened yesterday evening, Prime Minister came forward and told everyone, much to the relief for all of us who were present that he will take charge of Venkaiah Ji’s ‘primary’ responsibility,” said a senior member of the cabinet who wanted to remain anonymous.

While sharing little bit of information about what transpired at the cabinet meeting, the senior minister said, “Among all of us who were present, Smriti Ji was most relaxed, probably she knew she will get the ‘minor’ work I&B ministry, so no added responsibility will come her way. It was Arun Ji who looked most tense. Every time Prime Minister looked at him, he was looking other way.”

“It was natural for Arun Ji to be nervous because compared to others his work pressure is less. Situation with Pakistan and China, remains tense to highly tense leaving no scope for further deterioration, GST is already done, next year budget is long way with not many things available to do now. Most importantly no new accusations from Kirti Azad or Arvind Kejriwal, so no more defamation suits to file. PM feels he is mostly free,” said the minister.

The minister added “I can see the relief on Arun Ji’s face when Modi Ji said I will do it for ‘now’. That is when he said let us ‘grow stronger together’. We did not realize it is the new full form of GST till he explicitly said it.”

In the meantime, Venkaiah Ji was inconsolable after being told that he can no longer share his full forms to maintain the ‘dignity’ of the Vice-President position once he gets selected. “He stopped weeping after PM said he will create a separate WhatsApp group for this purpose, where people like him, Naidu ji can share their full forms.

Venkaiah Naidu today quit the party and handed over the reigns to Smriti Irani. Mr. Naidu, who earlier handled the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, relinquished his services by writing a farewell letter addressed to all his cabinet colleagues and well wishers.

However those who read the letter failed to decipher it as it was filled with acronyms from the first line to the last. Others said that from whatever they could understand it hardly sounded like a farewell letter. “It started with Modi and ended with Modi. Mr. Naidu just kept singing praises of our PM. Now how am I supposed to understand what he has written and what he means,” said a colleague.

Apparently, the letter was to be accompanied with a ‘book of long forms’ for the benefit of the reader. But it is not clear as to why the no one got a copy of the book.

Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari is said to have spent an entire afternoon reading the letter. Our reporter caught up with Mr. Gadkari at his official residence, while having a samosa with tea and enjoying the monsoon he said, “I am happy for Naiduji, he totally deserves it. I have know him for the last 20 years but still couldn’t figure out what he wanted to convey in the letter. It looked like some cryptic text. So I took it to a chemist shop hoping that the guy at the shop will help understand. Those guys are experts at reading such text.”

Mr. Gadkari was not the only one, after went viral on BJP Whatsapp group, many wanted to know the full form of what was written. “We know that he likes speaking in acronyms. It’s not new to us and some of them we have memorized to make things easier for us. But this is beyond our grasp,” said a BJP leader.

It didn’t take for Congress to comment on the letter.

Earlier this year, the leader had defended his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots by calling it a technical problem.

The rapid increase in the company’s turnover raised several eyebrows as the company which was making a meagre profit increased its turnover by an unbelievable 16,000 times in a period of one year.

Amit Shah, hailing the business strategy of Temple Enterprises, said, “This is exactly the kind of development Narendra bhai keeps talking about. If you think it’s a one-off company that has made profits, you can also check the accounts of any company owned by Mukesh bhai and see for yourself that it is overall development of the country. It’s pure hard work and nothing else.”

Interestingly, the company having Rs 80 crores as its turnover shut its operation just a month before demonetisation. Upon being questioned on the timely withdrawal from the market, Jay Shah said, “It’s all about prediction. If you are an entrepreneur, you have to do business keeping the uncertainty in mind. All thank to my dad’s sixth sense, we predicted demonetisation and stopped our business.”

Jay Shah further threatened that he would file a criminal defamation suit against our organisation if we asked him any more questions. Our reporter, who was in dire need to visit the washroom, refrained from asking him the way to the washroom after the threat to avoid getting sued.

When Amit Shah realised that the matter has reached Jay Shah’s washroom, he defended his son and said, “Getting the urge to pee is a technical problem of the journalist.” The All India Football Federation, after identifying Amit Shah’s ability of defending every accusation thrown at him since the 2014 Loksabha elections, announced that Amit Shah will be given the role of the defender in the Indian national football team.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/amit-shah-delhi-presser.jpg.image_.784.410.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/growth-sons-company-turnover-year-technical-problem-amit-shah-23643,Growth of my son’s company turnover in a year a technical problem: Amit Shah,,1507616521.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Finance Minister in his briefing announced GST reduction for 27 items.

One item that gathered maximum attention after GST reduction is Khakra. Khakra now has 5% GST, a reduction of 7% from earlier 12%. Soon after the news, Gujaratis were seen dancing on streets while many mumbaikars were seen protesting on streets with slogans and posters. Reportedly, a group of around 30 mumbaikars took to the roads Arun Jaitley’s announcement, demanding reduction of GST on Vada Pav and Misal Pav.

Faking News reporter spoke to one such mumbaikar, Santosh Khale, who was protesting at CM Fadnavis’ residence. Santosh said “Vada Pav is the basic necessity of every mumbaikar, if government can reduce GST on Khakra then why not on vadapav? Is government doing this only because Gujarat has elections coming?” Santosh further added “me tula sangto hai, Vada pav warcha GST kami kara, nahitar Bara honar nahi.” (I am telling you, reduce GST on vadapav else things won’t be good).

Though government has not yet reacted to the demand but seeing the momentum protest is gaining, the government has ordered Police to intervene and sources say that government may have to blink this time.

Reduction in GST on Khakra clearly indicates government’s priority. Gujarat election is scheduled for December hence steps to favour Gujaratis are not something unexpected. But at the same time government must consider needs of people from other states too and must reduce GST on items such as Poha in MP, Momos in Delhi, Vadapav in Mumbai and Idli sambhar in South India.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/d79dcf90-f7f2-4c04-98f0-3fcd269d6c6c.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbaikars-protest-demanding-gst-reduction-vadapav-gst-khakra-reduced-5-23609,Mumbaikars protest demanding GST reduction on vadapav after GST on Khakra reduced to 5%,,1507441087.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While defending, the ministers use standard responses like how India is the fastest economy in the world. The problem India is facing today are the legacy problems from previous UPA government, three and half years is nothing but little more than 1200 days, not sufficient to reverse all the bad work of UPA.

Surprisingly these standard responses didn’t get sufficient empathy for the government. Taking a view of that, some ministers have changed their tactics. Now they have started questioning the ‘niyat’ of the people who are criticizing the government.

One such minister while talking to us he said, “The reaction is coming from people who are jobless. These are the same people who do not pay a single penny as income tax to the state exchequer for nation building. Taking advantage of the unlimited data plans some telecom providers have provided, these people’s only job is to criticize the government in social media.”

We pointed to him that the same jobless people though do not pay income tax, they pay GST for most of the products they buy or the services they use, he told us, “So, what’s great they are doing. They are only doing their job as the law of the land demands”. On our query does law of the land prohibits such bad ‘niyat’ people to criticize the government, the Minister got agitated and stood up to leave the interview in the middle.

PM Modi, 67, had camped for three days in the holy city in March that helped give the BJP 312 of the 403 seats, the biggest majority for any party in Uttar Pradesh since 1977.But after March this is the first visit by the PM, which makes people think that he only visits during election time. People in Varanasi were seen asking each other if there is any election planned for the up coming days. PMO has installed posters at every corner of the city assuring that there is no election in the upcoming days and PM’s visit is only for inaugurating many infrastructure projects in the pious town. Modi Ji has promised that he will not talk about his achievements in the past 3 years and will not ask for votes for which people were afraid of.

Yogi Adityanath has ordered the civic work department to carry out major cleanliness drive for the PM’s visit. He is even sure that just like the PM did in Gujarat, he may announce some big initiatives for U.P, something on the lines of Metro, or river front or a big factory. PMO has also kept its ears wide open about any new announcement of the PM in Varanasi as they are the ones who have to implement what the PM promises in his constituency.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/modi-varanasi-ap-story_647_030417072234.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/election-commission-checking-announced-election-banaras-hearing-pms-visit-city-23356,Election Commission checking if they announced an election in Banaras after hearing about PM's visit to the city,,1506065641.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

But Nitish Kumar is not the one who thinks negative about every situation. Even the Dam collapse has been seen in a positive light be him.

According to Nitish Kumar, the dam collapse happened at the right time as it will save the money which was to be wasted on the inauguration of the dam. Every year Crs of Rs is spent on events planned to launch those projects. According to Nitish, today’s incident will serve as a reminder to the ministers that even nature doesn’t want a politician to keep on inaugurating new projects and wasting money.

Faking News reporter spoke to Nitish ji and he had this to say,” Look media presents everything in bad light. What if the dam collapsed. Should we just start crying and passing on blame from one person to another? This is a time for introspection. This is the sign given to us by mother nature that please don’t spend money on the inauguration of projects, instead, that money should be used to feed the poor.

The Bihar government has immediately cancelled all events planned across the states to launch various schemes. The money saved will be used to implement more schemes for the poor.

Now it has five such pillars with fifth being the Social Media. In the 21st century, social media is playing a vital role in the formation of government. Political parties are now realizing its potential and are trying to spread their positive influence there.

Currently, BJP has the maximum number of supporters on social media and hence it is easily winning polls conducted on such platforms. In a press conference on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah urged election commissioner to conduct the next Loksabha elections on twitter.

Right from 2014 elections, BJP had a strong grip on Twitter and has maintained it till date. It was after losing the 2014 Lok Sabha election, that Congress realized the power of social media. Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has asked all the INC members to be active on various social media platforms. Rahul Gandhi himself doesn’t have any social media account and his office account @OfficeOfRG tweets his whereabouts.

Congress’s official handle has started a new hashtag, #KnowYourLegacy, under which it conducts polls. The aim of the poll is to make people aware about various good work that congress has done during its regime. What congress is trying to do is not going its way. People are not believing that congress has done any good work and in a majority of polls winner is usually someone linked with BJP.

Congress has alleged BJP supporters of booth capturing. Allegedly, a few anti-congress elements are manipulating the polls and making BJP people win the polls. This is not only creating a wrong impression of congress among youths but also showing people’s lack of trust in congress.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has blamed BJP for Congress’ poor performance in Twitter polls. Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi assembly said, “Ye BJP wale twitter polls hack kar lete hain.. aur kuch to logon se phone maang k poll karke phone wapis kar dete hain.. Maine dekha hai ji. Maine vote congress ko diya tha magar wo chala gaya BJP ko.. ye sab modi ji karwa rahe hain.“

Election commission has not reacted to Amit Shah’s request yet but it has certainly led to a lesson for Congress social media, which is now avoiding BJP members in its polls. But it seems Congress is not having acche din that’s why even when BJP members aren’t there in the poll people are making NOTA win.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GUJARAT-POLLS.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-asks-next-election-held-twitter-congress-loses-series-twitter-polls-23320,BJP asks next election be held on Twitter after Congress loses series of Twitter polls,,1505886580.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Volunteer present there along with minister had to literally run around to ‘arrange’ some garbage for the program to kick start.

Taking a clue from this piece of news, Manu Thomas an entrepreneur has started a new startup called, “Garbage India” which will provide healthy, dust free, clean garbage to the VIPs whenever they need.

While Talking to us Mr. Manu Thomas said, “Celebrities, Ministers, Bureaucrats whoever need it, we will provide within six hours. We will have different options which they can choose while ordering. Like if you have dust allergy and care for the ‘health’ of the people who will be with you during that event, we suggest to go for ‘dust free’ options. It’s little costly, but I would say it is value for money looking at the health benefits”.

Mr. Thomas added, “While putting the order, we request VIPs to fill a questionnaire where we will ask them to fill in which place the event will happen, what they are planning to wear for that event. Depending on that we suggest few color options. As you can see in our catalogue, we have more than 30 varieties of color options for garbage. In our webpage as well as apps, you can see some sample photographs of celebrities how they look during Swachhta campaign with our garbage in the backdrop”.

When we asked Mr. Thomas will the garbage they provide is ‘organic’. He said, “Of course, it is. For our high-profile customers, we will order it from places like Switzerland and New Zealand. From start to end we will use only ‘ecofriendly’ material”.

With PM Modi’s chances of coming back to power almost 100% in 2019, Swachh Bharat Mission will continue for some more years.

I won’t say that I will not join the BJP if I get the chance, but who is giving me the chance? I haven’t sent them any request letter either,” Mr Singh told reporters in Indore. But this has sent shivers down the BJP management who are worried about Amar Singh actually joining them.

Yesterday night BJP headquarters hosted a meeting where seniors members raised concerns about Amar Singh joining them any time soon. PM Modi who was busy in his birthday celebrations left every thing and reached the headquarters to resolve the matter. Decision was taken about sending a commitee of members to Amar Singh’s house and convincing him of not joining BJP.

The committee members include Arun Jaitley, Prakash Javadekar and Manoj Sinha. Amar SIngh joining BJP would be a major blow for the party which is doing very well in all major states. There is a Modi wave which is sweeping across oppositions and taking hold of nation’s politics. The last thing BJP would want is someone like Amar Singh joining him who was expelled from a big party like the Samajwadi party.

Arun Jaitley explained Amar Singh ji that joining BJP would end his career as BJP is not a well governed party as it seems from outside. “Every decision is taken by Modi, your views will not be counted, you will not be given any major role”, is what Jaitley conveyed to Amar Singh.

Mr. Alphons has advised Mumbaikars to use local trains for their daily commute instead of using their fuel guzzling scooters and cars.

Demolition man demolishing the arguments against high fuel prices

Last week, the honorable minister had said that people buying two-wheelers and four-wheelers aren’t starving and can afford to pay the high tax levied by the government.

Speaking to the media earlier today, Mr. Alphons said ,”If they think fuel is not affordable then they can always use the state of the art public transport system that is in place. All these local trains are running always empty and people are not using them. They will save fuel, traffic congestion on the roads will decrease, pollution will decrease, they will be doing a great public service by switching to local trains from automobiles.”

When someone mentioned that local trains are always jam packed and there is no space to add even 1 person to the number of people using locals, the minister said ,”What are you taking about? I have seen Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local, Abhay Deol is traveling in a totally empty local at the end of the film. I have done my research, locals run empty.”

Meanwhile, Finance Ministry is planning to introduce a new cess for scooters, motorcycles and small cars, this cess will be applied retrospectively and everyone already owning a vehicle will also have to pay it. “If they can afford to pay these fuel prices in this economy, surely they can afford to pay this cess amount as well”, a Finance Ministry official said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/60390221.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/use-empty-locals-cant-afford-80-rslitre-petrol-union-minister-kl-alphons-mumbaikars-23264,Use those empty locals if you can't afford 80 Rs/Liter petrol: Union Minister KL Alphons to Mumbaikars,,1505714366.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

On Indian dynasties, he said, “Actually, most parties in India have that problem, so don’t give us stick. Mr Akhilesh Yadav (Samajwadi Party) is a dynast. Mr Stalin (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) is a dynast… Even Abhishek Bachchan (Bollywood actor) is a dynast. The one person to benefit from his address is Laloo Preasad Yadav as he thinks that even Rahul Gandhi acknowledges the fact that RJD is far away from dynastic politics and people of Bihar have full power to choose which of his two sons will become CM.

Faking News reporter caught up with Laloo yadav and he had this to say,” Right from the day I introduced both of my sons to politics, I had told them that I won’t select either of them to become CM as that power completely rests with the people in a democracy. All I can do is provide equal opportunities to both my sons which I am doing, after that it is the people of Bihar who will use their democratic power to let us know which of my son deserves the CM post.”

Though elections in Bihar are sometime away, people at least feel that unlike some of the other parties RJD is giving them two options and thats the reason they are grateful to Laloo Prasad Yadav. Both Tejasvi and Tejasvini Yadav have promised Laloo that they will not waste this opportunity bestowed upon them and use their communication power to reach out to people.

Though only few hours are left before PM’s flight takes off towards Delhi, PMO officials have not lost hope.

“We are working on a mission critical project called ‘Chaubis Ghante’ which means 24 hours. That is the total time we had in our hand when PM’s personal secretary Mishra ji called us this afternoon. He told us to find at least two countries who will be ready to host our PM in quick time. If there is a need Indian high commission officials in those countries will help them to make the visit a smooth affair,” said a PMO official who is in charge of this project.

PMO official added, “When we contact the countries for state visit like PM’s they ask for ‘agenda’. When I asked Mishra Ji what I should put under agenda, he was upset with me.”

Mishra ji asked me, “More than three years have passed and you still do not know agenda for PM’s trip. Just go through his previous visits and you should be able to find them on your own.”

“The tentative agenda we are sending is like this. 1st is ceremonial welcome followed by meeting with head of the country, visit to nearby historic monuments including temples, last but not the least address to Indian diaspora. After that we keep 4 to 5 slots as TBD. If someone like Priyanka Chopra or Suresh Raina are visiting, they can meet PM there. They are not important ones, just fillers before he returns home,” official shared few secrets how the planning is done at the PMO.

When we asked on countries PMO is trying, the official said, “There are many countries around Myanmar like Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia. Malaysia & Singapore are not far either. We are trying for Laos, a neighboring country many of us did not know exist. If Laos accept, it would mean a new one gets added to PM’s never ending foreign trips list.

An AIADMK mla has set himself a post GST price to extend support for the government, it is learnt by Faking News. Since mla pricing is not part of the GST council, he has made an independent decision to set a price for himself, his close aides told Faking News.

“GST is changing everything in India. There are pretty much GST sales everywhere. My rate remains the same till GST is implemented on the midnight of 30th of June. If I were to vote for supporting anyone or anything after that, my rate comes with a 28% tax on my regular rate. Since my base price is always kept confidential, I can only reveal my CTG rate for a one time payment to gain support for one full year” the mla told Faking News.

“I have never seen or known such a thing called cash-for-vote. But then, my party men distributed gifts to the voters during my election for the legislative assembly. I tried to stop them and I could not. Similar thing happened when my own party asked for my support to vote for them in various policy matters. They offered me a variety of gifts. I tried to stop them too and I could not. Finally, I gave in and formalised the process by setting a base price for myself” he further added.

“I do not particularly like the television and the social media trending with #mlasforsale. How is this of any interest to a common man India? Instead run coverages on the hot new promotional sales in India like #iphoneforsale.

“Such a terrible week for us. First India lost to Pakistan in the champions trophy final on Sunday and now see what happened, Shiv Sena supported BJP’s presidential candidate,” said one bookie who told us not reveal his identity while speaking to us.

The bookie added, “I do not know the reason why Shiv Sena did a u-turn within twenty four hours. To start with there was heavy betting that Shiv Sena will definitely oppose whomsoever BJP propose as candidate. People put good amount of money because there is history to back this betting. In 2007, Shiv Sena went against NDA candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawt, supported Pratibha Patil. In 2012 again they repeated the same, supported Pranab Mukherjee instead of NDA’s P A Sangma.”

“In our circle, there are people who were saying if PM Modi selects someone from Shiv Sena for President, still the party will oppose him.”

The bookie said, “People like us who suffered huge losses due to reversal of India Pakistan match result, we thought this is an opportunity to recover some of our losses. We added more money after Uddhavji told press immediately after Ram Nath Kovind’s name was announced, that there are attempts being made to play politics over a Dalit presidential candidate. If that is so, we are not interested in backing him. Now see, what happened.”

When we asked the bookie, what is the next step you are planning, he said, “Like me, many people from Maharashtra have suffered because of such unexpected decision.

But other than that reason, one of the major reasons was given by HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. According to him, selecting an unknown name would help UPSC set tough questions when it comes to naming President of India, something which was prevelant when Pratibha Patil was the president.

Most of the presidential candidates up till now have been renowned faces right from Abdul Kalam to Pranab Mukherjee to K.R Narayanan. Although these were prominent faces, they made the GK questions in UPSC exams quite easy to crack for the students who knew about these famous personalities. With the selection of a surprise face like Ram Nath Kovind, BJP wants to make UPSC exams tough for the candidates. In fact the government is likely to increase the number of questions on President’s life, right from his birth place to the school he went etc. etc. This will test the real knowledge of the students as they have never read about Ram Nath.

BJP has promised that it will follow the same logic while naming the Vice-President candidate and other candidates for some prominent positions like the RBI Governor, the CAG and SEBI president. The selection will be based on the surprise quotient of any name. More unknown the person, more chances of him holding a prominent position. It is rumored that Lal Krishna Advani has deleted all his information on the internet to make himself eligible for any new position based on the new criteria set by the government.

Whether it makes it tough for the students or not, only time will tell, but we can appreciate the government to let go the age old process of selecting known faces for important positions.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/aa-Cover-rf432h6mkj121ccdinjn825mn4-20170620005820.Medi_.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gk-questions-presidents-upsc-exam-getting-easy-selected-ram-nath-kovind-bjp-21579,"The GK questions about presidents in UPSC exam were getting too easy, so we selected Ram Nath Kovind: BJP",,1497945564.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Venkaiah naidu has assured the nation that soon the BJP will hold a meeting to decide when to have a meeting to decide the Presidential Nominee

Attacking the BJP, Ghulam Nabi Azad said: “There is no question of consensus on the issue as BJP has not mentioned any name, instead they tried asking us the same.” But the BJP top brass has taken this accusation clearly and Venkaiah Naidu has been handed over the task to resolve the issue soon.

The first task for Naidu would be to announce the date of the meeting for ‘deciding the date of meeting to select the candidate’. Directly selecting the candidate would be very mainstream according to Naidu. So it is important to first have a meeting to decide when to have a meeting to decide the candidate. With most BJP members busy in different parts of the country promoting the initiatives taken by Modi government in the last 3 years, it dose make sense that Naidu first wants everyone to come for a meeting where they will sit and decide when will be the next time they would be free, so that the Presidential elections can be discussed in detail.

But with no such news in the last 2 months, citizens are worried if the assembly is functioning or not. In fact many have filed RTI to know about the working condition of the assembly.

Watching porn is a right to freedom for a human, but when a MLA watches it in public daylight, that too inside assembly, it is bound to create an uproar. But at least that uproar made citizens confident about the functioning of assembly. People were of the belief that as long as such news is published regularly, they can be rest assured about their chosen MLAs attending assembly regularly.

Our Faking News reporter spoke to one such angry citizen named Lohit Shetty and he had this to say,” We choose our MLAs for them to discuss issues in assembly and come out with solution for public grievances. But lately, I have a major doubt creeping in whether these people are attending the discussion sessions or not. Where is the proof. At least when they were caught watching porn, we were given the proof that the MLAs were present in the assembly. Is the assembly dissolved now? Which party is in power? We don’t know anything now. That’s why we feel watching porn in the assembly should be made mandatory for all MLAs. In fact if they want more porn we can send it to their WhatsApp groups.

Anuj is the RBI clerk who was asked to physically count all the notes deposited in the banks in old currency notes during demonetisation. Since 1st January 2017, Anuj spends 12 hrs a day counting notes, notes, and more notes. However, he has hit a bump, and may have to start counting again from the beginning. Anuj is confused whether his counting had reached 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores and looks like the only way out is to start from 1.

!000 Rupee note- You remember?

Speaking to Faking News about his problem, Anuj said , “I had clear instructions that I must get the amount deposited during demonetisation absolutely right. There was no deadline given to me to finish this task. In fact, I was told that it is preferable if I donˈt finish counting till May 2019. Accuracy was the only crucial thing here but now with my confusion, I fear I am going to make a mistake. Only option is to start the entire counting process again.”

When asked how did he get confused, Anuj said ,”It is all Hardik Pandyaˈs fault. I was working overtime that Sunday and was following the match on Radio. As Pandya hit those 3 back to back 6s, I started dancing and kept shouting SIX……SIX…….SIX. When I calmed down after 5 minutes and returned to counting, my mind kept repeating 6 only and I forgot about all the other numbers. After thinking long and hard, I have narrowed down the possibilities to these 2 numbers, 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores. However, since I cant be sure, only solution is to start from 1.”

Reacting to this development, a senior official at the finance ministry said ,”Oh, someone is still counting? Desh bhool gaya yaar, use bolo wo bhi bhool jaaye.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/money-rupee-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rbi-clerk-counting-money-deposited-demonetisation-confused-whether-12654-crores-14652-crores-21337,"RBI clerk counting money deposited during demonetisation confused whether he was at 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores",,1496738617.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/year-topper-scores-0-2-last-year-topper-govt-says-another-proof-no-impact-demonetization-21236,"New Delhi: This year CBSE class 12 board exam topper Raksha Gopal has scored 99.6% which is a good 0.2% higher than what last year topper Sukriti Gupta scored. When Raksha Gopal got 498, Sukriti could manage only 497 out of 500 total marks.

Citing this as another piece of clinching evidence, finance ministry officials have highlighted how demonetization had no impact on any matter in India, in certain cases like this one it has shown improvement in result.

“We have been saying this for long, demonetization had a lot of tangible benefits along with lot of intangible benefits like this year CBSE topper’s record breaking performance”, said one of the finance ministry official who wanted to remain anonymous while speaking to us.

When we asked the official when we will see a complete report on demonetization, because more than five months over, still RBI is not disclosing how much money got deposited in banks. Every time we ask the question to RBI governor, he says bank people are still counting and final figures will be arrived only when this is complete.

Official from Finance ministry said, “RBI is an autonomous organization. We cannot interfere in its matter. However, we have suggested Governor to give some tentative dates, it can simply say it might take somewhere between 2 months to 200 months. It’s like the way Microsoft displays while installing the patch, it will take anywhere between 2 mins to 2 hours. Advantage of putting such boundary condition is, no one can question you till 200 months”.

The official added, “My office has already compiled every benefit that has come from demonetization. Final report would have been ready this week, but then we got this news from Bihar, where more than 64% students have failed in 12th board exam. Initial reports say due to cash crunch because of demonetization, not many were able to attach currency notes to answer scripts like they did last year. It seems demonetization has still some steam left, no other option, we have to wait”.

Despite so many positives, there are skeptics who are saying because of demonetization they had less cash in their pocket. RBI has asked banks, track such people through their Aadhaar, when they withdraw money from ATM or banks, give them cash only in new 1 rupee notes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pune-cbse-topper-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/year-topper-scores-0-2-last-year-topper-govt-says-another-proof-no-impact-demonetization-21236,"This year topper scores 0.2% more than last year topper, Govt says another proof of impact of demonetization",,1496232538.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

As expected the channel started with a bang, making public tapes of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and gangster-politician Shahabuddin. After that he conducted a series of Exposes on ISIS, Shashi Taroor and many more. So much so that he made politicians and other news makers famous overnight by conducting the exposes. Recently a U.P politician who is out of power has requested Arnab to conduct an expose on him to gain such much needed publicity.

Congress MLA from U.P Mr. Shwetank Srivastava has been out of news since last 10 years as congress doesn’t have a subsequent base or a strong hold in U.P politics nowadays. Shwetank tried a lot of things like ‘burning Modi effigies, sitting on dharnas, creating violence in the name of caste but all in vain. Finally he realized the most effective way of self-promotion i.e to appear on Arnab’s expose. For this, he has sent a formal request to the channel and has even submitted evidence against himself to get exposed.

Faking News reporter caught up with Shwetank and he had this to say, ” Arnab is continuously exposing people who are of national importance. Where will people like me go who belong to a degrading party and a city no one bothers to care about. Even we should get some footage, at least once a week. I have also committed crimes, taken law into my own hands, then why am I not being exposed. This is my request to Arnab Goswami, if he has the guts to carry my expose and maintain his TRPs. I will provide him all my phone recordings, documents, my contact list which includes all the goondas of U.P, he just has to expose me. The task is simpler for him now.”

At a function in Assam, PM Modi released a book that listed all the acronyms introduced by PM Modi and his cabinet. The book titled ‘GITA- Governance Is Through Acronyms’ is written by acronym expert Venkaiah Naidu.

AAI- Acronyms Association of India

As per sources, initially the plan was to just release a list of the acronyms to showcase government’s achievements but when they started listing them, they found that there is enough material for a book. Along with the acronyms, there are also stories of how these acronyms were thought of and the colorful stories behind them.

“This GITA is our government’s Gita. This will inspire us to keep working without worrying about the results. The title also tells us that governance should be done through acronyms only and that is why we will spend more and more time on new acronyms. This book took 3 years but hopefully, we will have enough material for a 2nd book before the elections in 2019″, Mr. Naidu said.

Further, he added ,”Hopefully people will recognize our hard work after reading this book and it will pave the way for ‘Modi Again’, MODI- Maker of Developed India, AGAIN- Acronyms Grow An Indian’s Nationalism.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Venkaiah-Naidu-Narendra-Modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-releases-book-listing-acronyms-introduced-ministers-past-3-years-21104,Government releases a book listing all the acronyms introduced by ministers over past 3 years,,1495783096.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

But to everyone’s surprise, he has not come up with any new allegations in the last 5 days. Media agencies are worried about this and are not able to plan their holidays due to this. They have requested Kapil to let them know about any new allegations, if at all he has any, so that their staff can plan their leaves accordingly.

He first accused Kejriwal of accepting a Rs 2 crore ‘bribe’ from Health Minister Satyendra Jain in connection with a land deal. He then went to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and submitted some incriminating documents. Media was getting some continuous work due to Mishra’s allegations and most of its staff was kept occupied by his stories. But most of them are now waiting for his next allegation, which can pop up anytime, and due to this they are not able to apply for leave.

Faking News reporter caught up with the head of Delhi media association Mr. Harneet Ahuja and he had this to say,” As a politician one should know when to start and when to stop making allegations. You cannot just start building a story and then wait for 5 days and then change the story. 100s of people are working day and night in covering Kapil Mishra’s stories, no one has gone on leave since last 10 days thinking that Kapil ji will come up with some breaking news.

An AIADMK mla has set himself a post GST price to extend support for the government, it is learnt by Faking News. Since mla pricing is not part of the GST council, he has made an independent decision to set a price for himself, his close aides told Faking News.

“GST is changing everything in India. There are pretty much GST sales everywhere. My rate remains the same till GST is implemented on the midnight of 30th of June. If I were to vote for supporting anyone or anything after that, my rate comes with a 28% tax on my regular rate. Since my base price is always kept confidential, I can only reveal my CTG rate for a one time payment to gain support for one full year” the mla told Faking News.

“I have never seen or known such a thing called cash-for-vote. But then, my party men distributed gifts to the voters during my election for the legislative assembly. I tried to stop them and I could not. Similar thing happened when my own party asked for my support to vote for them in various policy matters. They offered me a variety of gifts. I tried to stop them too and I could not. Finally, I gave in and formalised the process by setting a base price for myself” he further added.

“I do not particularly like the television and the social media trending with #mlasforsale. How is this of any interest to a common man India? Instead run coverages on the hot new promotional sales in India like #iphoneforsale. The viewers can simply switch on the TV to find out what to buy on a given day” he offered free advice to the national channels to increase their TRP ratings and encouraged them to stay away from #mlasforsale.

“Such a terrible week for us. First India lost to Pakistan in the champions trophy final on Sunday and now see what happened, Shiv Sena supported BJP’s presidential candidate,” said one bookie who told us not reveal his identity while speaking to us.

The bookie added, “I do not know the reason why Shiv Sena did a u-turn within twenty four hours. To start with there was heavy betting that Shiv Sena will definitely oppose whomsoever BJP propose as candidate. People put good amount of money because there is history to back this betting. In 2007, Shiv Sena went against NDA candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawt, supported Pratibha Patil. In 2012 again they repeated the same, supported Pranab Mukherjee instead of NDA’s P A Sangma.”

“In our circle, there are people who were saying if PM Modi selects someone from Shiv Sena for President, still the party will oppose him.”

The bookie said, “People like us who suffered huge losses due to reversal of India Pakistan match result, we thought this is an opportunity to recover some of our losses. We added more money after Uddhavji told press immediately after Ram Nath Kovind’s name was announced, that there are attempts being made to play politics over a Dalit presidential candidate. If that is so, we are not interested in backing him. Now see, what happened.”

When we asked the bookie, what is the next step you are planning, he said, “Like me, many people from Maharashtra have suffered because of such unexpected decision.

But other than that reason, one of the major reasons was given by HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. According to him, selecting an unknown name would help UPSC set tough questions when it comes to naming President of India, something which was prevelant when Pratibha Patil was the president.

Most of the presidential candidates up till now have been renowned faces right from Abdul Kalam to Pranab Mukherjee to K.R Narayanan. Although these were prominent faces, they made the GK questions in UPSC exams quite easy to crack for the students who knew about these famous personalities. With the selection of a surprise face like Ram Nath Kovind, BJP wants to make UPSC exams tough for the candidates. In fact the government is likely to increase the number of questions on President’s life, right from his birth place to the school he went etc. etc. This will test the real knowledge of the students as they have never read about Ram Nath.

BJP has promised that it will follow the same logic while naming the Vice-President candidate and other candidates for some prominent positions like the RBI Governor, the CAG and SEBI president. The selection will be based on the surprise quotient of any name. More unknown the person, more chances of him holding a prominent position. It is rumored that Lal Krishna Advani has deleted all his information on the internet to make himself eligible for any new position based on the new criteria set by the government.

Whether it makes it tough for the students or not, only time will tell, but we can appreciate the government to let go the age old process of selecting known faces for important positions.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/aa-Cover-rf432h6mkj121ccdinjn825mn4-20170620005820.Medi_.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gk-questions-presidents-upsc-exam-getting-easy-selected-ram-nath-kovind-bjp-21579,"The GK questions about presidents in UPSC exam were getting too easy, so we selected Ram Nath Kovind: BJP",,1497945564.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Singh and Naidu arrived at Gandhi’s 10 Janpath residence to help evolve an agreement on the crucial elections scheduled for Saturday. But the surprising part is that the ruling party i.e. the BJP has still not announced its candidate. Venkaiah naidu has assured the nation that soon the BJP will hold a meeting to decide when to have a meeting to decide the Presidential Nominee

Attacking the BJP, Ghulam Nabi Azad said: “There is no question of consensus on the issue as BJP has not mentioned any name, instead they tried asking us the same.” But the BJP top brass has taken this accusation clearly and Venkaiah Naidu has been handed over the task to resolve the issue soon.

The first task for Naidu would be to announce the date of the meeting for ‘deciding the date of meeting to select the candidate’. Directly selecting the candidate would be very mainstream according to Naidu. So it is important to first have a meeting to decide when to have a meeting to decide the candidate. With most BJP members busy in different parts of the country promoting the initiatives taken by Modi government in the last 3 years, it dose make sense that Naidu first wants everyone to come for a meeting where they will sit and decide when will be the next time they would be free, so that the Presidential elections can be discussed in detail.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rbi-clerk-counting-money-deposited-demonetisation-confused-whether-12654-crores-14652-crores-21337,"New Delhi: While the rest of the country has moved on after the demonetisation shock late last year, life has stood still for 30 yrs old Anuj Kumar. Anuj is the RBI clerk who was asked to physically count all the notes deposited in the banks in old currency notes during demonetisation. Since 1st January 2017, Anuj spends 12 hrs a day counting notes, notes, and more notes. However, he has hit a bump, and may have to start counting again from the beginning. Anuj is confused whether his counting had reached 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores and looks like the only way out is to start from 1.

!000 Rupee note- You remember?

Speaking to Faking News about his problem, Anuj said , “I had clear instructions that I must get the amount deposited during demonetisation absolutely right. There was no deadline given to me to finish this task. In fact, I was told that it is preferable if I donˈt finish counting till May 2019. Accuracy was the only crucial thing here but now with my confusion, I fear I am going to make a mistake. Only option is to start the entire counting process again.”

When asked how did he get confused, Anuj said ,”It is all Hardik Pandyaˈs fault. I was working overtime that Sunday and was following the match on Radio. As Pandya hit those 3 back to back 6s, I started dancing and kept shouting SIX……SIX…….SIX. When I calmed down after 5 minutes and returned to counting, my mind kept repeating 6 only and I forgot about all the other numbers. After thinking long and hard, I have narrowed down the possibilities to these 2 numbers, 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores. However, since I cant be sure, only solution is to start from 1.”

Reacting to this development, a senior official at the finance ministry said ,”Oh, someone is still counting? Desh bhool gaya yaar, use bolo wo bhi bhool jaaye.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/money-rupee-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rbi-clerk-counting-money-deposited-demonetisation-confused-whether-12654-crores-14652-crores-21337,"RBI clerk counting money deposited during demonetisation confused whether he was at 12,654 Crores or 14,652 Crores",,1496738617.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/year-topper-scores-0-2-last-year-topper-govt-says-another-proof-no-impact-demonetization-21236,"New Delhi: This year CBSE class 12 board exam topper Raksha Gopal has scored 99.6% which is a good 0.2% higher than what last year topper Sukriti Gupta scored. When Raksha Gopal got 498, Sukriti could manage only 497 out of 500 total marks.

Citing this as another piece of clinching evidence, finance ministry officials have highlighted how demonetization had no impact on any matter in India, in certain cases like this one it has shown improvement in result.

“We have been saying this for long, demonetization had a lot of tangible benefits along with lot of intangible benefits like this year CBSE topper’s record breaking performance”, said one of the finance ministry official who wanted to remain anonymous while speaking to us.

When we asked the official when we will see a complete report on demonetization, because more than five months over, still RBI is not disclosing how much money got deposited in banks. Every time we ask the question to RBI governor, he says bank people are still counting and final figures will be arrived only when this is complete.

Official from Finance ministry said, “RBI is an autonomous organization. We cannot interfere in its matter. However, we have suggested Governor to give some tentative dates, it can simply say it might take somewhere between 2 months to 200 months. It’s like the way Microsoft displays while installing the patch, it will take anywhere between 2 mins to 2 hours. Advantage of putting such boundary condition is, no one can question you till 200 months”.

The official added, “My office has already compiled every benefit that has come from demonetization. Final report would have been ready this week, but then we got this news from Bihar, where more than 64% students have failed in 12th board exam. Initial reports say due to cash crunch because of demonetization, not many were able to attach currency notes to answer scripts like they did last year. It seems demonetization has still some steam left, no other option, we have to wait”.

Despite so many positives, there are skeptics who are saying because of demonetization they had less cash in their pocket. RBI has asked banks, track such people through their Aadhaar, when they withdraw money from ATM or banks, give them cash only in new 1 rupee notes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pune-cbse-topper-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/year-topper-scores-0-2-last-year-topper-govt-says-another-proof-no-impact-demonetization-21236,"This year topper scores 0.2% more than last year topper, Govt says another proof of impact of demonetization",,1496232538.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

As expected the channel started with a bang, making public tapes of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and gangster-politician Shahabuddin. After that he conducted a series of Exposes on ISIS, Shashi Taroor and many more. So much so that he made politicians and other news makers famous overnight by conducting the exposes. Recently a U.P politician who is out of power has requested Arnab to conduct an expose on him to gain such much needed publicity.

Congress MLA from U.P Mr. Shwetank Srivastava has been out of news since last 10 years as congress doesn’t have a subsequent base or a strong hold in U.P politics nowadays. Shwetank tried a lot of things like ‘burning Modi effigies, sitting on dharnas, creating violence in the name of caste but all in vain. Finally he realized the most effective way of self-promotion i.e to appear on Arnab’s expose. For this, he has sent a formal request to the channel and has even submitted evidence against himself to get exposed.

Faking News reporter caught up with Shwetank and he had this to say, ” Arnab is continuously exposing people who are of national importance. Where will people like me go who belong to a degrading party and a city no one bothers to care about. Even we should get some footage, at least once a week. I have also committed crimes, taken law into my own hands, then why am I not being exposed. This is my request to Arnab Goswami, if he has the guts to carry my expose and maintain his TRPs. I will provide him all my phone recordings, documents, my contact list which includes all the goondas of U.P, he just has to expose me. The task is simpler for him now.”

At a function in Assam, PM Modi released a book that listed all the acronyms introduced by PM Modi and his cabinet. The book titled ‘GITA- Governance Is Through Acronyms’ is written by acronym expert Venkaiah Naidu.

AAI- Acronyms Association of India

As per sources, initially the plan was to just release a list of the acronyms to showcase government’s achievements but when they started listing them, they found that there is enough material for a book. Along with the acronyms, there are also stories of how these acronyms were thought of and the colorful stories behind them.

“This GITA is our government’s Gita. This will inspire us to keep working without worrying about the results. The title also tells us that governance should be done through acronyms only and that is why we will spend more and more time on new acronyms. This book took 3 years but hopefully, we will have enough material for a 2nd book before the elections in 2019″, Mr. Naidu said.

Further, he added ,”Hopefully people will recognize our hard work after reading this book and it will pave the way for ‘Modi Again’, MODI- Maker of Developed India, AGAIN- Acronyms Grow An Indian’s Nationalism.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Venkaiah-Naidu-Narendra-Modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-releases-book-listing-acronyms-introduced-ministers-past-3-years-21104,Government releases a book listing all the acronyms introduced by ministers over past 3 years,,1495783096.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

But to everyone’s surprise, he has not come up with any new allegations in the last 5 days. Media agencies are worried about this and are not able to plan their holidays due to this. They have requested Kapil to let them know about any new allegations, if at all he has any, so that their staff can plan their leaves accordingly.

He first accused Kejriwal of accepting a Rs 2 crore ‘bribe’ from Health Minister Satyendra Jain in connection with a land deal. He then went to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and submitted some incriminating documents. Media was getting some continuous work due to Mishra’s allegations and most of its staff was kept occupied by his stories. But most of them are now waiting for his next allegation, which can pop up anytime, and due to this they are not able to apply for leave.

Faking News reporter caught up with the head of Delhi media association Mr. Harneet Ahuja and he had this to say,” As a politician one should know when to start and when to stop making allegations. You cannot just start building a story and then wait for 5 days and then change the story. 100s of people are working day and night in covering Kapil Mishra’s stories, no one has gone on leave since last 10 days thinking that Kapil ji will come up with some breaking news. Kapil ji should provide us a schedule of when he is going to break any news related to corruption and scams and we will allocate resources accordingly..”

Kejriwal, who is fed up of such allegations now wants a separate minister to look after such cases.

Arun Jaitley has been continuously accusing the Delhi CM of defaming him and Kejriwal has been seeking legal advice on all such cases. But the number of cases has increased leaps and bounds and it is difficult for the CM to focus on governance. That’s the reason he called a cabinet meeting on Monday and decided to have a cabinet ranked minister taking care of such allegations.

The new minister has not yet been finalized and there will be interview rounds to select the same. The criteria mainly would be a person’s ability to project a defamation as a brain fade moment of the CM. Kejriwal wants someone very close to him to become the DGM (Defamation governing minister). In fact now he has promised that he will start defaming more politicians with the burden of tracking all charges taken off him.

The role of the new minister will be well documented and he will get bureaucrats to work under him, lawyers will he hired to provide legal advice, and reports will be furnished every month in a cabinet meeting. Kejriwal will also set a target of number of defamation cases won and based on that he will decide the future course of actions. The decision might come as a strong blow to Mr Ram Jethmalani, who was charging consulting fees as well as court appearance fees from the Delhi government as now he will be able to charge only appearance fees from the government.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kejriwal_jaitley_759-e1495529880158.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-cabinet-will-special-minister-will-keep-track-defamation-cases-cm-kejriwal-21063,Delhi cabinet will have a special minister who will keep track of defamation cases against the CM: Kejriwal,,1495538429.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Super star Rajnikanth, in recent times, has been meeting his fans to check the pulse of the state on entering politics. As is his inimitable style, he has agreed to recognize the Election Commission of India on the day of announcing his brand-new political party, it is learnt by Faking News.

A few Rajnikanth fans claim that the Election Commission was founded on 25th Jan 1950, for the government body to be ready for welcoming their supreme leader on 12th Dec 1950, it is also learnt by Faking News. Amazed by the new learning, when our reporter asked a die-hard fan about the abundant Rajnikanth jokes in the internet, he laughed out loud and narrated a story.

“Will tell you a real life incident! A few of us visited Rajni Sir’s home to seek his blessings. Rajni sir appeared like lightning in front of us and right then we realized the thing about him and the lightning is true. There was a TV on and an English movie Twister something was running but nothing could disturb our focus on the star. Not even the reflection of the TV on the glass doors of the living room,” he said.

Our dialogue began and Rajni sir mostly listened to us and spoke very briefly in between. However, once in about 3 to 5 minutes he was saying ‘infinity’. In two hours, he would have said this too many times, we lost count. Later when we read in the net that ‘Rajni can count up to infinity twice’, we knew that the observer spent only less than 10 minutes with our Thalaivar.

“And the other thing. Sir is so simple. He does not wear a watch. Several times, his personal assistant intervened our conversation with questions to sir. Thalaivar always told him the definitive replies: tea time, lunch time and sleeping time etc. Somebody noticed this too and wrote that ‘Rajni does not wear a watch. He decides what time it is,” the fan said with affirmation.

“At the end of two hours, he changed the movie to a cartoon channel and finally switched everything off and left. The place became so dead. I guess on these observations also two facts were recorded that ‘Rajni can kill a living room’ and ‘Once a tornado came in his way and seeing him, it changed course’; they are mistaken. Rajni changed the course of a tornado in one button click by changing the movie channel running Twister to a cartoon channel. These things you are calling as jokes? You must be kidding. These are facts. Only a blessed few had witnessed these rare acts live and in person,” the fan completed the narration.

While IT companies, hospitals, government departments and other establishments were terrified hearing about this news, AAP’s Delhi office was buzzing with enthusiasm.

A volunteer tweeted – “That’s exactly what we have been trying to explain to EC, using technology is not safe. We would urge companies to go back to using paper books for maintaining accounts and doing business.”

Some volunteers took out crackers from party office store room and started bursting them. Something which was pending since 11th March, the day assembly elections results of Goa and Punjab were announced.

Manish Sisodia who was hard to be seen since Kapil Mishra’s allegations started coming thick and fast, came out of his home with a box of sweets and declared, “I want to thank ‘The Shadow Broker’, the hacker group who created WannaCry malware. They have vindicated our stand that irrespective of all the security deployed any machine can be hacked. And these guys didn’t even require change of the motherboard. Our party needs such bright people.”

AAP has reportedly reached out to ‘The Shadow Brokers’ inviting them for the hackathon. An elated Ashutosh told Shaitaan Khopdi™, “If EC is so confident that EVMs can’t be hacked why they are not allowing WannaCry creators to participate in EVM hackathon? Are they scared of getting exposed?” Soon after telling this Ashutosh started negotiating with hackers to participate in EVM Hackathon as AAP representative. Below are the excerpts from the chat between hackers and Ashutosh –

Ashutosh: URL? We don’t have URL or INR, we can only pay in Canadian Dollars through our contacts. Take it or leave it.

Hacker: Will take it. Meanwhile, give us EVM server address so that we can hack them

Ashutosh: Server address? AAP is against caste system. And we treat everyone as equal. No master, no server.

Hacker: Umm… Ok let me put it this way, can you give us VIP (Virtual IP Address)

Ashutosh: As I told you before, we are against VIP culture. Everyone is Aam Aadmi (other than few exceptions).

Hacker: Ok. Give us the Aam Aadmi address then. (whatever you mean by that) Ashutosh gives link of Aam Aadmi Party’s website address and next thing we knew was that it was hacked.

He thanked the party leadership for the action taken and took a promise in front of the media that he would take corrective measures and improve himself to earn the party’s membership again.

“Lalu ji is not an official part of the government, so he doesn’t have a day to day say on governance matters. But as he has been doing so since years, he wants to contribute towards clean governance.

This is his way of helping the government,”, said one of the RJD officials.

The official further added,” Once we come to know the exact number of criminals using cellphones inside the jail, we will furnish the list and the government will act according to the law. Credit should go to laluji for such an innovative method of tackling criminals in the state. If the survey would have been done my a non famous person no criminal would have undertaken the survey, but with Laluji conducting it, the criminals have to talk to him on phone and doesn’t have an option to say no.”

This is the 5th day on a trot when he has done so and that leaves the nation concerned.

M Venkaiah Naidu who is known for his catchphrases has given plenty of names for government schemes and other relevant entities. He proudly proclaimed that the country’s mission is MODI — Making Of a Developed India. Earlier, the minister had called the Prime Minister Modifier Of Developing India (Modi). There is also a parody account on twitter. The profile came into existence as recently as March, it makes reverse acronyms of names of political leaders, including Mr Naidu. Their Twitter bio spells out “NAIDU” as “National Acronym Innovation & Design University”

He has been given the task of spreading awareness about the government schemes and party leaders through the interesting medium of creating acronyms. And Mr. Naidu is very good at it. His opposition colleagues are also very interested while he rolls out acronym after acronyms. But, now that he has not produced or coined a new term in the last 5 days, the citizens are concerned. Most of them feel that the government has not launched any new scheme in the last few days.

There are rumors that PM Modi did call up Venkaiah ji as recently as yesterday and asked him to speed up the roll out of new acronyms.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been handling the Defense ministry as an additional charge. Now to finalize the name of the next Raksha Mantri, PM Modi called a meeting of his senior cabinet colleagues. We risked our lives and managed to get the details of the conversation held during the meeting.

Serious discussion in progress

Please read the detailed transcript below:

Narendra Modi- Mitron, as you know that the post of Raksha mantra has been lying vacant since Parrikar ji left to laugh at Digvijay Singh in Goa. Now we need to finalize a good candidate as soon as possible because we can’t keep it vacant for long. Any suggestions?

Piyush Goyal- Modi ji before we begin, one announcement. There are packs of LED bulbs outside for everyone. Please collect your pack while leaving.

Narendra Modi- Goyal ji kahin to bulb chhod do. Haan bhai, vacant Raksha Mantri post. Thoughts?

Arun Jaitley- Modi ji why are you repeatedly calling it vacant, Main Hoon Na. I didn’t get any salary hike with the added responsibility, at least don’t take away my credit. I am the Raksha Mantri

Rajnath Singh- We haven’t found a Raksha Mantri in the past 6 weeks? Hum is sarkaar ki is vifalta ki kadi ninda karte hain.

Venkaiah Naidu- Raksha- Rapid Action Keeping (us) Safe (and) Harm Away- Raksha Mantri

Narendra Modi- O nahin yaar Venkaiah, this is not the time. Keep these things for public. Right now tell me what to do about the vacant Raksha Mantri post

Arun Jaitley- (Sigh)

Ravi Shankar Prasad- Don’t worry about it Modi Ji. You just tell me ki resignation kiska maangna hai iske liye?

Venkaiah Naidu– Resignation- Ravi Expects Someone In Government Now Admits That..

Nitin Gadkari– O Venkaiah, Thamba Thamba… Yaar pehle samosa mangwa lein. Dimaag nahin chal raha aise.

Ram Vilas Paswan– Samose par koi service charge mat dena agar jaldi deliver nahin kiye to. Maine uska arrangement karwa diya hai. Aur agar aadha samosa khana ho to aadha hi mangwana.

Rajnath Singh- Hahaha kya Paswan Ji, Gadkari ji aur aadha samosa?

Narendra Modi- Arey samosa baad me kha lenge bhai, Raksha Mantri kise banayein? Raksha Mantri chahiye.

Vijay Goel- Modi ji, what I think is….

Narendra Modi- Ye kaun hai? Andar kaise aaya?

Vijay Goel- Main Sports Minister sir, wo Olympics bhi gaya tha selfie lene.

Narendra Modi- Selfie se yaad aaya, aao pehle ek group selfie le lein. Rajnath ji, aapke haath bahut lambe hain, phone aap handle karo.

Venkaiah Naidu- Selfie- Self Engagement Lovingly… Can I say F se Foto for the purpose of this acronym?

Narendra Modi- Venkaiah Ji, Lets Escape Audio Violence Everyone

Venkaiah Naidu- Hain? Matlab?

Narendra Modi– LEAVE!

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ec-cancels-rk-nagar-polls-citing-cash-votes-asks-parties-use-digital-transactions-20340,"By-elections in Chennai’s RK Nagar constituency – to be held on Wednesday – have been cancelled by the Election Commission citing the possibility of cash-for-votes used by politicians. EC has come down heavily on the political parties accusing them of taking India backwards by using such means. In fact it has directed parties to use only digital transactions-for-votes.

Income tax raids in Chennai found stashes of unaccounted money to be distributed among voters. In this age of digitization, it’s a pity that the politicians are not using digital mediums for such transactions.

Our Faking News reporter spoke to the EC spokesperson in Chennai and he had this to say, “Money is used in all parts of India to buy votes. But that is not a big issue. The issue really is that do we want to take our country forward or not. Since last 3-4 months the government is spreading awareness about digital money, but nothing has changed. The biggest use of cash is India is for voter incentives and if this cannot be digitized then God help the other services where digitization is required.”

Parties in Chennai have assured EC to at least do some percentage of the transactions in digital as doing it 100 % would be impossible at such a short notice. Party volunteers were seen installing various digital payment apps on the smartphones of the voters and the voters not having smartphones will be paid via cheque or demand drafts. There is a huge boom in the number of apps installed and digital companies are proving cashback incentives for voters to use their applications.

Voters are a bit confused because they are yet to use such mediums. The data of every transaction made will have to be submitted to the EC and EC will verify if voters got the due share. We should congratulate the Election Commission for putting its foot down and showing the political parties who the boss is.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/800x480_IMAGE66052886-e1491894248253.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ec-cancels-rk-nagar-polls-citing-cash-votes-asks-parties-use-digital-transactions-20340,"EC cancels the RK Nagar polls citing cash-for-votes, asks parties to use digital transactions",,1491894700.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/not-racist-eat-white-idli-black-ragi-dosa-tarun-vijay-20315,"New Delhi: While participating in a discussion on Al Jazeera channel, ex-BJP MP Tarun Vijay said that Indians cannot be called racists as they live with “black people” from the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Though he clarified later that this was just a misinterpretation of his badly framed sentence, the outrage over it is refusing to die down.

Now, to prove once and for all that he is not a racist, Tarun Vijay has made public the details of his breakfast. Tarun Vijay has said that how can he be a racist when he starts his day by eating a white idli, and a black ragi dosa every day.

Mr. Vijay said, “As you know idli and dosa are south Indian food items, but I like them more than a parantha or chhole-bhature. Please tell me if I have no affection for South Indian people, why would I do that? I can easily have half a dozen paranthas and go to sleep straight after breakfast but I don’t do that.”

When we asked why doesn’t he eat conventional dosa made from urad dal batter instead of ragi dosa, Mr. Vijay said, “For me, there is one clear criteria, for every white dish, I should have a black dish as well. If white idli, then dosa must be black. Some days ragi batter might not be ready, then I ask my cook to burn the conventional dosa, so that it becomes fully dark. I have no problem in eating a burnt dosa, for me color is important. That is why it hurt me so much when people alleged that I am racist.”

After that, we took our leave as Mr. Vijay returned to his fruit salad of white banana and black grapes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Instant-Ragi-dosa.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/not-racist-eat-white-idli-black-ragi-dosa-tarun-vijay-20315,"I am not racist, I eat ‘white’ idli and ‘black’ ragi dosa: Tarun Vijay",,1491719226.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Ever since Mr. Gaikwad beat up an Air India staff member with his chappal, all airlines have put a flight ban on him. Now with his own hot air balloon, Mr. Gaikwad will travel freely from Mumbai to Delhi.

Mr. Gaikwad on his way to Delhi

Being a member of the Parliament, Mr. Gaikwad was repeatedly required to go the national capital and he was finding it difficult to do that with his flight ban. Now he is confident that he can execute his duties with the help of his balloon.

Confirming his new purchase, Mr. Gaikwad said ,”Yes I have bought a new hot air balloon. I got the idea when I read somewhere that all Shiv Sena MPs are full of hot air. Now with my balloon, I will be able to fly, and will travel freely from Mumbai to Delhi so take that Air India! Now try and stop me from flying.”

“Traveling via train or road is very stressful over this distance so I needed to fly. Initially I thought about buying my own plane, taking flying lessons, and fly the plane myself. Nut then I gave up the idea when someone mentioned to me that the ground staff at airports is also pretty mad at me. I thought about working as a parliamentarian from a remote location, like Tendulkar and Rekha, but my conscience didn’t allow me to do that. Finally, I have found the perfect solution. I retain my ego, I don’t have to apologize, and I can keep executing my duties”, Mr. Gaikwad added.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sainiks who were headed to the Mumbai airport to dig up the runways, have been told to return by the party high command since they no longer need to fight with the aviation ministry.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/full-hot-air-balloons-near-arenal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/shiv-sena-mp-ravindra-gaikwad-buys-hot-air-balloon-20276,Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad buys a hot air balloon,,1491548079.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-cabinet-will-special-minister-will-keep-track-defamation-cases-cm-kejriwal-21063,"New Delhi: The Delhi High Court today sought the response of Arvind Kejriwal on a fresh Rs 10 crore defamation suit filed by Union Minister Arun Jaitley over the use of an objectionable word by the Chief Minister’s lawyer Ram Jethmalani recently. Kejriwal, who is fed up of such allegations now wants a separate minister to look after such cases.

Arun Jaitley has been continuously accusing the Delhi CM of defaming him and Kejriwal has been seeking legal advice on all such cases. But the number of cases has increased leaps and bounds and it is difficult for the CM to focus on governance. That’s the reason he called a cabinet meeting on Monday and decided to have a cabinet ranked minister taking care of such allegations.

The new minister has not yet been finalized and there will be interview rounds to select the same. The criteria mainly would be a person’s ability to project a defamation as a brain fade moment of the CM. Kejriwal wants someone very close to him to become the DGM (Defamation governing minister). In fact now he has promised that he will start defaming more politicians with the burden of tracking all charges taken off him.

The role of the new minister will be well documented and he will get bureaucrats to work under him, lawyers will he hired to provide legal advice, and reports will be furnished every month in a cabinet meeting. Kejriwal will also set a target of number of defamation cases won and based on that he will decide the future course of actions. The decision might come as a strong blow to Mr Ram Jethmalani, who was charging consulting fees as well as court appearance fees from the Delhi government as now he will be able to charge only appearance fees from the government.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kejriwal_jaitley_759-e1495529880158.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-cabinet-will-special-minister-will-keep-track-defamation-cases-cm-kejriwal-21063,Delhi cabinet will have a special minister who will keep track of defamation cases against the CM: Kejriwal,,1495538429.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajnikanth-agreed-recognise-election-commission-india-day-political-party-announcement-21060,"Chennai. Super star Rajnikanth, in recent times, has been meeting his fans to check the pulse of the state on entering politics. As is his inimitable style, he has agreed to recognize the Election Commission of India on the day of announcing his brand-new political party, it is learnt by Faking News.

A few Rajnikanth fans claim that the Election Commission was founded on 25th Jan 1950, for the government body to be ready for welcoming their supreme leader on 12th Dec 1950, it is also learnt by Faking News. Amazed by the new learning, when our reporter asked a die-hard fan about the abundant Rajnikanth jokes in the internet, he laughed out loud and narrated a story.

“Will tell you a real life incident! A few of us visited Rajni Sir’s home to seek his blessings. Rajni sir appeared like lightning in front of us and right then we realized the thing about him and the lightning is true. There was a TV on and an English movie Twister something was running but nothing could disturb our focus on the star. Not even the reflection of the TV on the glass doors of the living room,” he said.

Our dialogue began and Rajni sir mostly listened to us and spoke very briefly in between. However, once in about 3 to 5 minutes he was saying ‘infinity’. In two hours, he would have said this too many times, we lost count. Later when we read in the net that ‘Rajni can count up to infinity twice’, we knew that the observer spent only less than 10 minutes with our Thalaivar.

“And the other thing. Sir is so simple. He does not wear a watch. Several times, his personal assistant intervened our conversation with questions to sir. Thalaivar always told him the definitive replies: tea time, lunch time and sleeping time etc. Somebody noticed this too and wrote that ‘Rajni does not wear a watch. He decides what time it is,” the fan said with affirmation.

“At the end of two hours, he changed the movie to a cartoon channel and finally switched everything off and left. The place became so dead. I guess on these observations also two facts were recorded that ‘Rajni can kill a living room’ and ‘Once a tornado came in his way and seeing him, it changed course’; they are mistaken. Rajni changed the course of a tornado in one button click by changing the movie channel running Twister to a cartoon channel. These things you are calling as jokes? You must be kidding. These are facts. Only a blessed few had witnessed these rare acts live and in person,” the fan completed the narration.

While IT companies, hospitals, government departments and other establishments were terrified hearing about this news, AAP’s Delhi office was buzzing with enthusiasm.

A volunteer tweeted – “That’s exactly what we have been trying to explain to EC, using technology is not safe. We would urge companies to go back to using paper books for maintaining accounts and doing business.”

Some volunteers took out crackers from party office store room and started bursting them. Something which was pending since 11th March, the day assembly elections results of Goa and Punjab were announced.

Manish Sisodia who was hard to be seen since Kapil Mishra’s allegations started coming thick and fast, came out of his home with a box of sweets and declared, “I want to thank ‘The Shadow Broker’, the hacker group who created WannaCry malware. They have vindicated our stand that irrespective of all the security deployed any machine can be hacked. And these guys didn’t even require change of the motherboard. Our party needs such bright people.”

AAP has reportedly reached out to ‘The Shadow Brokers’ inviting them for the hackathon. An elated Ashutosh told Shaitaan Khopdi™, “If EC is so confident that EVMs can’t be hacked why they are not allowing WannaCry creators to participate in EVM hackathon? Are they scared of getting exposed?” Soon after telling this Ashutosh started negotiating with hackers to participate in EVM Hackathon as AAP representative. Below are the excerpts from the chat between hackers and Ashutosh –

Ashutosh: Hi, is this Shadow Boxer?

Hacker: No we are Shadow Broker

Ashutosh: Broker? You mean Agent? Modi’s agent?

Hacker: No dude we named our group ‘The Shadow Broker’

Ashutosh: Can you hack EVM?

Hacker: We can hack anything, just give us URL

Ashutosh: URL? We don’t have URL or INR, we can only pay in Canadian Dollars through our contacts. Take it or leave it.

Hacker: Will take it. Meanwhile, give us EVM server address so that we can hack them

Ashutosh: Server address? AAP is against caste system. And we treat everyone as equal. No master, no server.

Hacker: Umm… Ok let me put it this way, can you give us VIP (Virtual IP Address)

Ashutosh: As I told you before, we are against VIP culture. Everyone is Aam Aadmi (other than few exceptions).

Hacker: Ok. Give us the Aam Aadmi address then. (whatever you mean by that) Ashutosh gives link of Aam Aadmi Party’s website address and next thing we knew was that it was hacked.

A sacked party member called for a press conference in the capital city, immediately after the sacking. The media was on high alert and assembled in large numbers to listen to the accusations and big revelation. To everyone’s disappointment, the party-man was full of praise for the party leader. He thanked the party leadership for the action taken and took a promise in front of the media that he would take corrective measures and improve himself to earn the party’s membership again.

Opposition parties protesting outside Parliament

“I erred. It was a moment of weakness. My party leadership had time and again warned of strict action against any wrong doings. While I feel extremely shy to elaborate on the error perpetrated, I would like to simply admit it. I would have resigned even if my party has not sacked me,” Mapil Kishra told Faking News.

When some reporters relentlessly asked for any juicy information on big exposes, he said, “Are you kidding? How can a sacked person blame the party leadership? What credibility would that have? The ACB would throw away the documents as useless. I will become the laughing stock of the nation for a few days. I will be looked upon as a student reporting against principal for rewarding me with suspension for misbehavior.”

When a reporter pointed out that his behavior is totally out of the normal trend, “I know it is not normal. The obvious thing is to challenge the party high command, tell the media that they are corrupt, join opposition and become a member in one of their parties or start something new, how much ever useless the new outfit would become! No. I am not going to fall into any of these comical activities,” he further added.

“You will never get anything out of me. It is not even on the ‘Need-to-know’ basis.

But more worried are the retail counters of Patanjali products as the shampoo and oil sales have reached an all time low.

Rishabh Academy School in Sadar area had warned students they will not be allowed to attend school till they got the buzz haircut, akin to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s. Parents are worried that witha similar haircut, it will be difficult for them to distinguish between their children and their neighbor’s children. The Patanjali traders who were selling a lot of Shampoo and oil products will now face a slump in business and it is evident from the sales of past week as to how tough business will be in coming days.

Our Faking News reporter caught up with one such trader named Sanil Srivastava who had this to say, ” People have a great trust in Patanjali products because of its authenticity and purity. But with such decisions how will we sell our products to the school going kids. Ramdev ji is trying to inculcate the culture of Ayurveda in the modern Indian students, and these schools are going against Ramdev ji in working for a good cause. We condemn the decision and want to convey it to the schools that look at Einstein, his hairs were long and thick and he was a genious. It would be better if students get that haircut. That way, they will become genious and our sales will also increase.”

But if sources are to be believed, Lalu used this technique to do a survey on whether criminals are able to access phones inside the jail or not, so that government can cat accordingly.

“Lalu ji is not an official part of the government, so he doesn’t have a day to day say on governance matters. But as he has been doing so since years, he wants to contribute towards clean governance. In the past 2 weeks Laluji has called many criminals in jails just to confirm whether the use of cell phones in Bihar jails is rampant. This is his way of helping the government,”, said one of the RJD officials.

The official further added,” Once we come to know the exact number of criminals using cellphones inside the jail, we will furnish the list and the government will act according to the law. Credit should go to laluji for such an innovative method of tackling criminals in the state. If the survey would have been done my a non famous person no criminal would have undertaken the survey, but with Laluji conducting it, the criminals have to talk to him on phone and doesn’t have an option to say no.”

Lalu Prasad Yadav, as we speak has submitted his plan of action pertaining to the survey to Nitish Kumar. There is a list of criminals whom he will call in the next 1 month and wants full government support in this regards. He has asked the Nitish kumar government and also his own party members to not get bogged down by allegations from a TV channel or news reporters.

This is the 5th day on a trot when he has done so and that leaves the nation concerned.

M Venkaiah Naidu who is known for his catchphrases has given plenty of names for government schemes and other relevant entities. He proudly proclaimed that the country’s mission is MODI — Making Of a Developed India. Earlier, the minister had called the Prime Minister Modifier Of Developing India (Modi). There is also a parody account on twitter. The profile came into existence as recently as March, it makes reverse acronyms of names of political leaders, including Mr Naidu. Their Twitter bio spells out “NAIDU” as “National Acronym Innovation & Design University”

In fact the nation has been thinking that this is the sole job of Naidu in the cabinet. He has been given the task of spreading awareness about the government schemes and party leaders through the interesting medium of creating acronyms. And Mr. Naidu is very good at it. His opposition colleagues are also very interested while he rolls out acronym after acronyms. But, now that he has not produced or coined a new term in the last 5 days, the citizens are concerned. Most of them feel that the government has not launched any new scheme in the last few days.

There are rumors that PM Modi did call up Venkaiah ji as recently as yesterday and asked him to speed up the roll out of new acronyms. He has even suggested the minister to take help of college students on social media platform to come up with interesting suggestions.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been handling the Defense ministry as an additional charge. Now to finalize the name of the next Raksha Mantri, PM Modi called a meeting of his senior cabinet colleagues. We risked our lives and managed to get the details of the conversation held during the meeting.

Serious discussion in progress

Please read the detailed transcript below:

Narendra Modi- Mitron, as you know that the post of Raksha mantra has been lying vacant since Parrikar ji left to laugh at Digvijay Singh in Goa. Now we need to finalize a good candidate as soon as possible because we can’t keep it vacant for long. Any suggestions?

Piyush Goyal- Modi ji before we begin, one announcement. There are packs of LED bulbs outside for everyone. Please collect your pack while leaving.

Narendra Modi- Goyal ji kahin to bulb chhod do. Haan bhai, vacant Raksha Mantri post. Thoughts?

Arun Jaitley- Modi ji why are you repeatedly calling it vacant, Main Hoon Na. I didn’t get any salary hike with the added responsibility, at least don’t take away my credit. I am the Raksha Mantri

Rajnath Singh- We haven’t found a Raksha Mantri in the past 6 weeks? Hum is sarkaar ki is vifalta ki kadi ninda karte hain.

Venkaiah Naidu- Raksha- Rapid Action Keeping (us) Safe (and) Harm Away- Raksha Mantri

Narendra Modi- O nahin yaar Venkaiah, this is not the time. Keep these things for public. Right now tell me what to do about the vacant Raksha Mantri post

Arun Jaitley- (Sigh)

Ravi Shankar Prasad- Don’t worry about it Modi Ji. You just tell me ki resignation kiska maangna hai iske liye?

Venkaiah Naidu– Resignation- Ravi Expects Someone In Government Now Admits That..

Nitin Gadkari– O Venkaiah, Thamba Thamba… Yaar pehle samosa mangwa lein. Dimaag nahin chal raha aise.

Ram Vilas Paswan– Samose par koi service charge mat dena agar jaldi deliver nahin kiye to. Maine uska arrangement karwa diya hai. Aur agar aadha samosa khana ho to aadha hi mangwana.

Rajnath Singh- Hahaha kya Paswan Ji, Gadkari ji aur aadha samosa?

Narendra Modi- Arey samosa baad me kha lenge bhai, Raksha Mantri kise banayein? Raksha Mantri chahiye.

Vijay Goel- Modi ji, what I think is….

Narendra Modi- Ye kaun hai? Andar kaise aaya?

Vijay Goel- Main Sports Minister sir, wo Olympics bhi gaya tha selfie lene.

Narendra Modi- Selfie se yaad aaya, aao pehle ek group selfie le lein. Rajnath ji, aapke haath bahut lambe hain, phone aap handle karo.

Venkaiah Naidu- Selfie- Self Engagement Lovingly… Can I say F se Foto for the purpose of this acronym?

Narendra Modi- Venkaiah Ji, Lets Escape Audio Violence Everyone

Venkaiah Naidu- Hain? Matlab?

Narendra Modi– LEAVE!

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ec-cancels-rk-nagar-polls-citing-cash-votes-asks-parties-use-digital-transactions-20340,"By-elections in Chennai’s RK Nagar constituency – to be held on Wednesday – have been cancelled by the Election Commission citing the possibility of cash-for-votes used by politicians. EC has come down heavily on the political parties accusing them of taking India backwards by using such means. In fact it has directed parties to use only digital transactions-for-votes.

Income tax raids in Chennai found stashes of unaccounted money to be distributed among voters. In this age of digitization, it’s a pity that the politicians are not using digital mediums for such transactions.

Our Faking News reporter spoke to the EC spokesperson in Chennai and he had this to say, “Money is used in all parts of India to buy votes. But that is not a big issue. The issue really is that do we want to take our country forward or not. Since last 3-4 months the government is spreading awareness about digital money, but nothing has changed. The biggest use of cash is India is for voter incentives and if this cannot be digitized then God help the other services where digitization is required.”

Parties in Chennai have assured EC to at least do some percentage of the transactions in digital as doing it 100 % would be impossible at such a short notice. Party volunteers were seen installing various digital payment apps on the smartphones of the voters and the voters not having smartphones will be paid via cheque or demand drafts. There is a huge boom in the number of apps installed and digital companies are proving cashback incentives for voters to use their applications.

Voters are a bit confused because they are yet to use such mediums. The data of every transaction made will have to be submitted to the EC and EC will verify if voters got the due share. We should congratulate the Election Commission for putting its foot down and showing the political parties who the boss is.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/800x480_IMAGE66052886-e1491894248253.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ec-cancels-rk-nagar-polls-citing-cash-votes-asks-parties-use-digital-transactions-20340,"EC cancels the RK Nagar polls citing cash-for-votes, asks parties to use digital transactions",,1491894700.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/not-racist-eat-white-idli-black-ragi-dosa-tarun-vijay-20315,"New Delhi: While participating in a discussion on Al Jazeera channel, ex-BJP MP Tarun Vijay said that Indians cannot be called racists as they live with “black people” from the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Though he clarified later that this was just a misinterpretation of his badly framed sentence, the outrage over it is refusing to die down.

Now, to prove once and for all that he is not a racist, Tarun Vijay has made public the details of his breakfast. Tarun Vijay has said that how can he be a racist when he starts his day by eating a white idli, and a black ragi dosa every day.

Mr. Vijay said, “As you know idli and dosa are south Indian food items, but I like them more than a parantha or chhole-bhature. Please tell me if I have no affection for South Indian people, why would I do that? I can easily have half a dozen paranthas and go to sleep straight after breakfast but I don’t do that.”

When we asked why doesn’t he eat conventional dosa made from urad dal batter instead of ragi dosa, Mr. Vijay said, “For me, there is one clear criteria, for every white dish, I should have a black dish as well. If white idli, then dosa must be black. Some days ragi batter might not be ready, then I ask my cook to burn the conventional dosa, so that it becomes fully dark. I have no problem in eating a burnt dosa, for me color is important. That is why it hurt me so much when people alleged that I am racist.”

After that, we took our leave as Mr. Vijay returned to his fruit salad of white banana and black grapes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Instant-Ragi-dosa.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/not-racist-eat-white-idli-black-ragi-dosa-tarun-vijay-20315,"I am not racist, I eat ‘white’ idli and ‘black’ ragi dosa: Tarun Vijay",,1491719226.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Ever since Mr. Gaikwad beat up an Air India staff member with his chappal, all airlines have put a flight ban on him. Now with his own hot air balloon, Mr. Gaikwad will travel freely from Mumbai to Delhi.

Mr. Gaikwad on his way to Delhi

Being a member of the Parliament, Mr. Gaikwad was repeatedly required to go the national capital and he was finding it difficult to do that with his flight ban. Now he is confident that he can execute his duties with the help of his balloon.

Confirming his new purchase, Mr. Gaikwad said ,”Yes I have bought a new hot air balloon. I got the idea when I read somewhere that all Shiv Sena MPs are full of hot air. Now with my balloon, I will be able to fly, and will travel freely from Mumbai to Delhi so take that Air India! Now try and stop me from flying.”

“Traveling via train or road is very stressful over this distance so I needed to fly. Initially I thought about buying my own plane, taking flying lessons, and fly the plane myself. Nut then I gave up the idea when someone mentioned to me that the ground staff at airports is also pretty mad at me. I thought about working as a parliamentarian from a remote location, like Tendulkar and Rekha, but my conscience didn’t allow me to do that. Finally, I have found the perfect solution. I retain my ego, I don’t have to apologize, and I can keep executing my duties”, Mr. Gaikwad added.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sainiks who were headed to the Mumbai airport to dig up the runways, have been told to return by the party high command since they no longer need to fight with the aviation ministry.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/full-hot-air-balloons-near-arenal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/shiv-sena-mp-ravindra-gaikwad-buys-hot-air-balloon-20276,Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad buys a hot air balloon,,1491548079.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/growth-sons-company-turnover-year-technical-problem-amit-shah-23643,"After a news website broke the story that the turnover of Temple Enterprises, a company owned by Amit Shah’s son, Jay Shah, rose from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80 crores in a year after Narendra Modi got elected as the prime minister, BJP President Amit Shah has defended his son by saying that the sudden rise is a technical problem. Earlier this year, the leader had defended his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots by calling it a technical problem.

The rapid increase in the company’s turnover raised several eyebrows as the company which was making a meagre profit increased its turnover by an unbelievable 16,000 times in a period of one year.

Amit Shah, hailing the business strategy of Temple Enterprises, said, “This is exactly the kind of development Narendra bhai keeps talking about. If you think it’s a one-off company that has made profits, you can also check the accounts of any company owned by Mukesh bhai and see for yourself that it is overall development of the country. It’s pure hard work and nothing else.”

Interestingly, the company having Rs 80 crores as its turnover shut its operation just a month before demonetisation. Upon being questioned on the timely withdrawal from the market, Jay Shah said, “It’s all about prediction. If you are an entrepreneur, you have to do business keeping the uncertainty in mind. All thank to my dad’s sixth sense, we predicted demonetisation and stopped our business.”

Jay Shah further threatened that he would file a criminal defamation suit against our organisation if we asked him any more questions. Our reporter, who was in dire need to visit the washroom, refrained from asking him the way to the washroom after the threat to avoid getting sued.

When Amit Shah realised that the matter has reached Jay Shah’s washroom, he defended his son and said, “Getting the urge to pee is a technical problem of the journalist.” The All India Football Federation, after identifying Amit Shah’s ability of defending every accusation thrown at him since the 2014 Loksabha elections, announced that Amit Shah will be given the role of the defender in the Indian national football team.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/amit-shah-delhi-presser.jpg.image_.784.410.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/growth-sons-company-turnover-year-technical-problem-amit-shah-23643,Growth of my son’s company turnover in a year a technical problem: Amit Shah,,1507616521.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbaikars-protest-demanding-gst-reduction-vadapav-gst-khakra-reduced-5-23609,"NEW DELHI: On Friday , after 12 hour long meeting Arun Jaitely announced a slew of measures to ease the concerns of small business, traders and Gujarat elections. Finance Minister in his briefing announced GST reduction for 27 items.

One item that gathered maximum attention after GST reduction is Khakra. Khakra now has 5% GST, a reduction of 7% from earlier 12%. Soon after the news, Gujaratis were seen dancing on streets while many mumbaikars were seen protesting on streets with slogans and posters. Reportedly, a group of around 30 mumbaikars took to the roads Arun Jaitley’s announcement, demanding reduction of GST on Vada Pav and Misal Pav.

Faking News reporter spoke to one such mumbaikar, Santosh Khale, who was protesting at CM Fadnavis’ residence. Santosh said “Vada Pav is the basic necessity of every mumbaikar, if government can reduce GST on Khakra then why not on vadapav? Is government doing this only because Gujarat has elections coming?” Santosh further added “me tula sangto hai, Vada pav warcha GST kami kara, nahitar Bara honar nahi.” (I am telling you, reduce GST on vadapav else things won’t be good).

Though government has not yet reacted to the demand but seeing the momentum protest is gaining, the government has ordered Police to intervene and sources say that government may have to blink this time.

Reduction in GST on Khakra clearly indicates government’s priority. Gujarat election is scheduled for December hence steps to favour Gujaratis are not something unexpected. But at the same time government must consider needs of people from other states too and must reduce GST on items such as Poha in MP, Momos in Delhi, Vadapav in Mumbai and Idli sambhar in South India.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/d79dcf90-f7f2-4c04-98f0-3fcd269d6c6c.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbaikars-protest-demanding-gst-reduction-vadapav-gst-khakra-reduced-5-23609,Mumbaikars protest demanding GST reduction on vadapav after GST on Khakra reduced to 5%,,1507441087.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/people-speaking-bad-government-jobless-dont-pay-tax-bjp-minister-23496,"New Delhi: After Yashwant Sinha’s strong criticism about the way current NDA government is handling India’s economy, many ministers have come forward ‘proactively’ to defend the government.

While defending, the ministers use standard responses like how India is the fastest economy in the world. The problem India is facing today are the legacy problems from previous UPA government, three and half years is nothing but little more than 1200 days, not sufficient to reverse all the bad work of UPA.

Surprisingly these standard responses didn’t get sufficient empathy for the government. Taking a view of that, some ministers have changed their tactics. Now they have started questioning the ‘niyat’ of the people who are criticizing the government.

One such minister while talking to us he said, “The reaction is coming from people who are jobless. These are the same people who do not pay a single penny as income tax to the state exchequer for nation building. Taking advantage of the unlimited data plans some telecom providers have provided, these people’s only job is to criticize the government in social media.”

We pointed to him that the same jobless people though do not pay income tax, they pay GST for most of the products they buy or the services they use, he told us, “So, what’s great they are doing. They are only doing their job as the law of the land demands”. On our query does law of the land prohibits such bad ‘niyat’ people to criticize the government, the Minister got agitated and stood up to leave the interview in the middle.

Our reporter who was going to his hometown for Dussehra festival after paying a hefty price for a premium tatkal ticket, got a kick on his ass from railway TTE as he was sleeping after 6 AM. “Law of the land says you cannot sleep beyond 6 AM. Your Aadhaar is linked boss, we can track who is doing what in this country.

Though it is a big occasion for PM Modi, it has created havoc in the election commission office. Most of the officers are checking if there is an election anytime soon in Varanasi and whether they have missed out marking the dates in their calendar.

PM Modi, 67, had camped for three days in the holy city in March that helped give the BJP 312 of the 403 seats, the biggest majority for any party in Uttar Pradesh since 1977.But after March this is the first visit by the PM, which makes people think that he only visits during election time. People in Varanasi were seen asking each other if there is any election planned for the up coming days. PMO has installed posters at every corner of the city assuring that there is no election in the upcoming days and PM’s visit is only for inaugurating many infrastructure projects in the pious town. Modi Ji has promised that he will not talk about his achievements in the past 3 years and will not ask for votes for which people were afraid of.

Yogi Adityanath has ordered the civic work department to carry out major cleanliness drive for the PM’s visit. He is even sure that just like the PM did in Gujarat, he may announce some big initiatives for U.P, something on the lines of Metro, or river front or a big factory. PMO has also kept its ears wide open about any new announcement of the PM in Varanasi as they are the ones who have to implement what the PM promises in his constituency.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/modi-varanasi-ap-story_647_030417072234.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/election-commission-checking-announced-election-banaras-hearing-pms-visit-city-23356,Election Commission checking if they announced an election in Banaras after hearing about PM's visit to the city,,1506065641.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

But Nitish Kumar is not the one who thinks negative about every situation. Even the Dam collapse has been seen in a positive light be him.

According to Nitish Kumar, the dam collapse happened at the right time as it will save the money which was to be wasted on the inauguration of the dam. Every year Crs of Rs is spent on events planned to launch those projects. According to Nitish, today’s incident will serve as a reminder to the ministers that even nature doesn’t want a politician to keep on inaugurating new projects and wasting money.

Faking News reporter spoke to Nitish ji and he had this to say,” Look media presents everything in bad light. What if the dam collapsed. Should we just start crying and passing on blame from one person to another? This is a time for introspection. This is the sign given to us by mother nature that please don’t spend money on the inauguration of projects, instead, that money should be used to feed the poor.

The Bihar government has immediately cancelled all events planned across the states to launch various schemes. The money saved will be used to implement more schemes for the poor.

Now it has five such pillars with fifth being the Social Media. In the 21st century, social media is playing a vital role in the formation of government. Political parties are now realizing its potential and are trying to spread their positive influence there.

Currently, BJP has the maximum number of supporters on social media and hence it is easily winning polls conducted on such platforms. In a press conference on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah urged election commissioner to conduct the next Loksabha elections on twitter.

Right from 2014 elections, BJP had a strong grip on Twitter and has maintained it till date. It was after losing the 2014 Lok Sabha election, that Congress realized the power of social media. Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has asked all the INC members to be active on various social media platforms. Rahul Gandhi himself doesn’t have any social media account and his office account @OfficeOfRG tweets his whereabouts.

Congress’s official handle has started a new hashtag, #KnowYourLegacy, under which it conducts polls. The aim of the poll is to make people aware about various good work that congress has done during its regime. What congress is trying to do is not going its way. People are not believing that congress has done any good work and in a majority of polls winner is usually someone linked with BJP.

Congress has alleged BJP supporters of booth capturing. Allegedly, a few anti-congress elements are manipulating the polls and making BJP people win the polls. This is not only creating a wrong impression of congress among youths but also showing people’s lack of trust in congress.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has blamed BJP for Congress’ poor performance in Twitter polls. Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi assembly said, “Ye BJP wale twitter polls hack kar lete hain.. aur kuch to logon se phone maang k poll karke phone wapis kar dete hain.. Maine dekha hai ji. Maine vote congress ko diya tha magar wo chala gaya BJP ko.. ye sab modi ji karwa rahe hain.“

Election commission has not reacted to Amit Shah’s request yet but it has certainly led to a lesson for Congress social media, which is now avoiding BJP members in its polls. But it seems Congress is not having acche din that’s why even when BJP members aren’t there in the poll people are making NOTA win.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GUJARAT-POLLS.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-asks-next-election-held-twitter-congress-loses-series-twitter-polls-23320,BJP asks next election be held on Twitter after Congress loses series of Twitter polls,,1505886580.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Volunteer present there along with minister had to literally run around to ‘arrange’ some garbage for the program to kick start.

Taking a clue from this piece of news, Manu Thomas an entrepreneur has started a new startup called, “Garbage India” which will provide healthy, dust free, clean garbage to the VIPs whenever they need.

While Talking to us Mr. Manu Thomas said, “Celebrities, Ministers, Bureaucrats whoever need it, we will provide within six hours. We will have different options which they can choose while ordering. Like if you have dust allergy and care for the ‘health’ of the people who will be with you during that event, we suggest to go for ‘dust free’ options. It’s little costly, but I would say it is value for money looking at the health benefits”.

Mr. Thomas added, “While putting the order, we request VIPs to fill a questionnaire where we will ask them to fill in which place the event will happen, what they are planning to wear for that event. Depending on that we suggest few color options. As you can see in our catalogue, we have more than 30 varieties of color options for garbage. In our webpage as well as apps, you can see some sample photographs of celebrities how they look during Swachhta campaign with our garbage in the backdrop”.

When we asked Mr. Thomas will the garbage they provide is ‘organic’. He said, “Of course, it is. For our high-profile customers, we will order it from places like Switzerland and New Zealand. From start to end we will use only ‘ecofriendly’ material”.

With PM Modi’s chances of coming back to power almost 100% in 2019, Swachh Bharat Mission will continue for some more years.

I won’t say that I will not join the BJP if I get the chance, but who is giving me the chance? I haven’t sent them any request letter either,” Mr Singh told reporters in Indore. But this has sent shivers down the BJP management who are worried about Amar Singh actually joining them.

Yesterday night BJP headquarters hosted a meeting where seniors members raised concerns about Amar Singh joining them any time soon. PM Modi who was busy in his birthday celebrations left every thing and reached the headquarters to resolve the matter. Decision was taken about sending a commitee of members to Amar Singh’s house and convincing him of not joining BJP.

The committee members include Arun Jaitley, Prakash Javadekar and Manoj Sinha. Amar SIngh joining BJP would be a major blow for the party which is doing very well in all major states. There is a Modi wave which is sweeping across oppositions and taking hold of nation’s politics. The last thing BJP would want is someone like Amar Singh joining him who was expelled from a big party like the Samajwadi party.

Arun Jaitley explained Amar Singh ji that joining BJP would end his career as BJP is not a well governed party as it seems from outside. “Every decision is taken by Modi, your views will not be counted, you will not be given any major role”, is what Jaitley conveyed to Amar Singh.

Mr. Alphons has advised Mumbaikars to use local trains for their daily commute instead of using their fuel guzzling scooters and cars.

Demolition man demolishing the arguments against high fuel prices

Last week, the honorable minister had said that people buying two-wheelers and four-wheelers aren’t starving and can afford to pay the high tax levied by the government.

Speaking to the media earlier today, Mr. Alphons said ,”If they think fuel is not affordable then they can always use the state of the art public transport system that is in place. All these local trains are running always empty and people are not using them. They will save fuel, traffic congestion on the roads will decrease, pollution will decrease, they will be doing a great public service by switching to local trains from automobiles.”

On Indian dynasties, he said, “Actually, most parties in India have that problem, so don’t give us stick. Mr Akhilesh Yadav (Samajwadi Party) is a dynast. Mr Stalin (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) is a dynast… Even Abhishek Bachchan (Bollywood actor) is a dynast. The one person to benefit from his address is Laloo Preasad Yadav as he thinks that even Rahul Gandhi acknowledges the fact that RJD is far away from dynastic politics and people of Bihar have full power to choose which of his two sons will become CM.

Faking News reporter caught up with Laloo yadav and he had this to say,” Right from the day I introduced both of my sons to politics, I had told them that I won’t select either of them to become CM as that power completely rests with the people in a democracy. All I can do is provide equal opportunities to both my sons which I am doing, after that it is the people of Bihar who will use their democratic power to let us know which of my son deserves the CM post.”

Though elections in Bihar are sometime away, people at least feel that unlike some of the other parties RJD is giving them two options and thats the reason they are grateful to Laloo Prasad Yadav. Both Tejasvi and Tejasvini Yadav have promised Laloo that they will not waste this opportunity bestowed upon them and use their communication power to reach out to people. Taking clue from Laloo Yadav, Rahul Gandhi has requested Sonia Gandhi to project both him and Priyanka for the PM’s post and then let people decide their future.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bihar-lalu-prasad-yadav-tejaswi-tej-pratap-newsx_0.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/laloo-yadav-believe-democracy-not-dynastic-politics-let-people-bihar-decide-sons-will-become-cm-23183,Laloo Yadav: I believe in democracy and not dynastic politics so let people of Bihar decide which of my sons will become CM,,1505286414.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Though only few hours are left before PM’s flight takes off towards Delhi, PMO officials have not lost hope.

“We are working on a mission critical project called ‘Chaubis Ghante’ which means 24 hours. That is the total time we had in our hand when PM’s personal secretary Mishra ji called us this afternoon. He told us to find at least two countries who will be ready to host our PM in quick time. If there is a need Indian high commission officials in those countries will help them to make the visit a smooth affair,” said a PMO official who is in charge of this project.

PMO official added, “When we contact the countries for state visit like PM’s they ask for ‘agenda’. When I asked Mishra Ji what I should put under agenda, he was upset with me.”

Mishra ji asked me, “More than three years have passed and you still do not know agenda for PM’s trip. Just go through his previous visits and you should be able to find them on your own.”

“The tentative agenda we are sending is like this. 1st is ceremonial welcome followed by meeting with head of the country, visit to nearby historic monuments including temples, last but not the least address to Indian diaspora. After that we keep 4 to 5 slots as TBD. If someone like Priyanka Chopra or Suresh Raina are visiting, they can meet PM there. They are not important ones, just fillers before he returns home,” official shared few secrets how the planning is done at the PMO.

When we asked on countries PMO is trying, the official said, “There are many countries around Myanmar like Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia. Malaysia & Singapore are not far either. We are trying for Laos, a neighboring country many of us did not know exist. If Laos accept, it would mean a new one gets added to PM’s never ending foreign trips list.

From now on, staring at the cows will be a punishable offence, a law to that effect has been passed by the Gujarat assembly.

Cows will be safe in the state now!

Anyone caught staring at the cows will be detained by the newly formed ‘Pro-Bovine Squads’ in the state and will be prosecuted in accordance with the new law. Maximum punishment under this new law is 7 yrs imprisonment and 10 lakhs Rupees fine.

Confirming the new law, state CM Vijay Rupani said ,”We must aspire not only for a vegetarian Gujarat but also for a Gujarat where cows can roam freely without getting stared at. Cows should be free to go out at any time of the day or night without attracting stares from beef lovers. Protecting cows is our first and foremost duty and we are fully committed to that.”

When asked how will policemen know who is staring at a cow, Mr Rupani said ,”All members of our ‘Pro-Bovine Squad’ are veteran policemen. With all their experience, they can always tell who is just looking and who is staring. They can count feathers of a flying bird, distinguishing between looking and staring is easy for them.”

Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who trashed Air India staffer with this slipper for not providing a business class seat has been extended an offer to join anti-romeo squad.

Speaking to Faking News, Director General of Police Mr. Javed Ahmed said, “As you are aware that the anti-romeo squad in functional in UP and the results are positive in the first couple of days itself. The only problem we are facing is the shortage of man power. We are constantly of the look out for talent and that is the reason why we have sent across an request to Mr. Gaikwad asking him to join the squad.”

“Came to know from the media that he hit Air-India employee 25 times. I mean that is some skill in trashing people. I have no doubt that his skills can be put to good use if he joins our squad,” Mr. Ahmed added.

Sources say that UP CM Yogi Adityanath too seemed impressed with the Mr. Gaikwad and keeping aside the political differences between BJP and Shiv Sena agreed to have him in the squad.

“On an average we cathch around 30 to 50 romeos in a day. Trashing them is not an easy task. With the support of the Gaikwad sahab the task of beating up romeos will be child’s play,” said a source close to the CM.

Though UP CM may be impressed, Mr. Gaikwad’s own party wasn’t really pleased with the controversy surrounding the trashing of AI staffer.

“How could he use slipper to hit the staff. I mean we just got majority in BMC elections. At least he should have used some branded footwear like Woodland. It reflects so poorly on our party.

After this appointment, fans of Kapil Sharma show and Extraaa Innings were worried that they won’t get to see Sidhu again but the man has dismissed all these concerns now.

As per party leader Rajpal Yadav, if EVMs were not hacked, SSP would have formed a government with a clear majority.

“BJP hacked our majority away!”

Results for UP assembly were declared on the 11th of March and BJP won a landslide victory with Samajwadi party a distant 2nd, followed by BSP in 3rd place. SSP failed to win a single seat and Rajpal Yadav has alleged that it is only due to EVM hacking.

Speaking to media at a function in Lucknow, Mr. Yadav said ,”There is definitely some hacking involved else how did we fail to win clear majority? Forget majority, we didn’t even get a single seat. Despite our long and illustrious political career, why did we fail? SP was in power, everyone expected SSP to replace them but that didn’t happen. Election Commission must agree for an independent probe so that all these questions are answered.”

“We conducted an internal survey before the elections and it showed that we will win 260 out of 403 seats then we didn’t we? There can’t be anything wrong at our end, it is simply a conspiracy hatched by BJP and its allies. If BJP is confident that it won fair and square then they must conduct the polls again with paper ballots and we will see who emerges as the winner”, Yadav added.

The oath taking ceremony is scheduled for Thursday morning but Congress wants the ceremony to take place within the next few hours.

Time to take oath

Congress got more seats than BJP in both Manipur and Goa but BJP managed to stitch together alliances faster than Congress and beat them to the majority in both states. Now even though they have a clear majority in Punjab, they don’t want to risk anything.

Confirming the instructions sent to Captain Amarinder, a senior Congress politician said ,”You can’t trust Amit Shah at all. We have a comfortable majority today but who knows what he will do tomorrow. We were confident about forming governments in Manipur and Goa as well but look what happened. UP, Uttarakhand were fine but now BJP is forming governments even in states where we won comfortably more seats than them. What if Amit Shah and Modi decide that they want to form governments in all 5 states that went to poll? No need to give them any window to pull off any backroom deal.”

“We have full faith in our MLAs that they won’t leave us but we have no faith in Amit Shah and his team of managers, they may manage everything. They have no political decency, at least let us rule the states where we are winning more states yaar.

Parties that did not do well in the elections have raised concerns that the machines were manipulated to favor specific candidates.

BSP Chief Mayawati was vocal while raising doubts over BJP getting maximum votes in UP and even went ahead asking for an investigation into the matter.

The report that an independent candidate from Mumbai who go zero votes even after casting a vote in his favor has got the EC thinking. “We have always stood for free and fair elections and this time around too we’d like it to be it that way. So we have decided to send EVMs for narco test. Machines would be sent to labs in Hyderabad,” said a senior official from the commission.

When questioned if re-elections would take place if the machines were tampered with, the official refused to comment.

Our reporter also visited the lab where a few EVMs were already being tested. One such machine fitted with electrodes was found lying on the bed with an attendant asking, “EVM listen to me. Did anyone tamper with you?”

Sources say that the process will be completed in a week and a decision regarding re-elections if any will be announced soon.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi welcomed the move and raised doubts that some EVMs come fitted with Chinese parts and it is important to have them checked. “Accha hai ki EVM ki surgery ho rahi hai. Kya ye machine China se bankar aati hai? Waha ke log bhi khush hote honge jab unhe pata chalta hoga ki hum Made in China ke EVM istamal karte hain.

No more drama

Since the former CM, late J Jayalalitha unfortunately passed away, Tamil Nadu politics has seen more twists and turns than Pune’s cricket pitch. O Panneerselvam became the stand-in CM for few days. He resigned a few days later and everyone thought that Sasikala will become the next CM. But then OPS dramatically withdrew his resignation becoming the CM once again but Sasikala managed to keep the MLAs on her side through her excellent hospitality in Golden bay Resort.

However, just when Sasikala was preparing to take oath, the Supreme court sentenced her to four years of imprisonment. To everybody’s surprise, E Palanisamy was declared as the next CM. His elevation to the CM chair was so unexpected that there wasn’t even a Wikipedia page in his name when he took oath of office.

Mr. JJ Swamy, a common man from Chennai speaking to Faking News said, “Tamil Nadu politics was so enthralling over the past few weeks. You never knew who would become the CM. The uncertainty made the politics entertaining and exciting. But now, it is the same CM for 2 weeks in a row, there is no chance of him being replaced either. It has all become a bit boring.

“Aa raha hoon main…. Aapke campus me”

After commenting on the recent fracas between AISA and ABVP at Ramjas college in Delhi, Mr Rijiju has again commented on the stand taken by a Kargil martyr’s daughter on Twitter. Now, he wants to get more actively involved in student politics and campus fights, and is actively seeking these fights.

Since a minister of state for home affairs has precious little responsibility otherwise, Mr Rijiju has a lot of time on his hands to roam around all the colleges in the city.

Confirming the news, a home ministry official said, “It is not that he will get involved in every fight. If he starts doing that, he will be trapped in 100 fights in one college alone, Delhi hai bhai. He is only looking for those fights where student gangs groups like ABVP, AISA, NSUI, SFI etc are involved. Unless there is a ‘National-Anti-National’ angle involved, there is no point in honorable minister joining in.”

Working in home ministry, he is responsible for law and order inside the country. Colleges are a part of the country so he is just doing his job here.”

Elections in India are always stretched out over several weeks as they are very good for the economy. All the cash kept in the homes of politicians comes out in circulation, several small scale industries make money manufacturing flags and banners, unemployed youth get the job of attending political rallies for good amount of money.

In response, PM Narendra Modi said that donkeys are very good animals who keep working for their masters even when they are hungry and tired.

Donkeys association has condemned both the statements and has asked the politicians to leave them alone. Speaking to Faking News, a leading member of donkey protest march said ,”What was the need for Akhilesh Yadav to drag us into politics? We were quietly going about our work without disturbing anyone but he had to needle us. Why shouldn’t Amitabh Bachchan do an ad featuring us? He promotes every single product in the world but Akhilesh ji doesn’t have a problem, he promotes our brothers and suddenly there is an outrage? Why this discrimination against us?”

“We are also not happy with Modi Ji. What does he mean when he says donkeys will keep working even when they are hungry. Is he telling our masters that they don’t need to feed us? We also need lunch break like any other worker bhai. Modi ji is supporting people who make us work long hours without giving us a break. We don’t even get overtime. This practice must be condemned, not glorified”, the donkey said.

“I am not going anywhere”

In the Amarinder Singh led government, Navjot Singh Sidhu has been given the portfolios of Local Government and Tourism & Culture Affairs. After this appointment, fans of Kapil Sharma show and Extraaa Innings were worried that they won’t get to see Sidhu again but the man has dismissed all these concerns now.

Speaking to the press in Chandigarh, Mr. Sidhu said ,”My opponents are spreading all these nasty rumors about me that I will give up Kapil Sharma Show or that I won’t be a part of IPL this year. Let me tell all my fans that this is all rubbish and I will continue to work on television. After all, work is worship.”

“I can understand the concern that this ministry-vinistry may interfere in my work but I am professional enough to carry out my duties despite the burden this ministry has placed on me. My first and foremost priority will remain my TV work and I will look at this ministry only during my spare time, if any. I never compromised with my TV work when I was an MP in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha so why will I start compromising now when I am an MLA?” Mr Sidhu asked.

As per party leader Rajpal Yadav, if EVMs were not hacked, SSP would have formed a government with a clear majority.

“BJP hacked our majority away!”

Results for UP assembly were declared on the 11th of March and BJP won a landslide victory with Samajwadi party a distant 2nd, followed by BSP in 3rd place. SSP failed to win a single seat and Rajpal Yadav has alleged that it is only due to EVM hacking.

Speaking to media at a function in Lucknow, Mr. Yadav said ,”There is definitely some hacking involved else how did we fail to win clear majority? Forget majority, we didn’t even get a single seat. Despite our long and illustrious political career, why did we fail? SP was in power, everyone expected SSP to replace them but that didn’t happen. Election Commission must agree for an independent probe so that all these questions are answered.”

“We conducted an internal survey before the elections and it showed that we will win 260 out of 403 seats then we didn’t we? There can’t be anything wrong at our end, it is simply a conspiracy hatched by BJP and its allies. If BJP is confident that it won fair and square then they must conduct the polls again with paper ballots and we will see who emerges as the winner”, Yadav added.

Meanwhile, Election Commission is considering a proposal to hold elections again and again till every party doesn’t emerge with equal number of seats. “Only that will stop these people from charging us with favoritism, when everyone will get equal number of seats”, an election commission official said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Actor-Rajpal-_20161118_350_630.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/evms-not-hacked-sarv-sambhav-party-won-rajpal-yadav-19831,"If EVMs were not hacked, Sarv Sambhav Party would have won UP: Rajpal Yadav",,1489573308.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Concerned party high command has now instructed Captain Amarinder to take oath in Punjab as soon as possible to avoid any slip there as well despite getting a comfortable majority. The oath taking ceremony is scheduled for Thursday morning but Congress wants the ceremony to take place within the next few hours.

Time to take oath

Congress got more seats than BJP in both Manipur and Goa but BJP managed to stitch together alliances faster than Congress and beat them to the majority in both states. Now even though they have a clear majority in Punjab, they don’t want to risk anything.

Confirming the instructions sent to Captain Amarinder, a senior Congress politician said ,”You can’t trust Amit Shah at all. We have a comfortable majority today but who knows what he will do tomorrow. We were confident about forming governments in Manipur and Goa as well but look what happened. UP, Uttarakhand were fine but now BJP is forming governments even in states where we won comfortably more seats than them. What if Amit Shah and Modi decide that they want to form governments in all 5 states that went to poll? No need to give them any window to pull off any backroom deal.”

“We have full faith in our MLAs that they won’t leave us but we have no faith in Amit Shah and his team of managers, they may manage everything. They have no political decency, at least let us rule the states where we are winning more states yaar.

Parties that did not do well in the elections have raised concerns that the machines were manipulated to favor specific candidates.

BSP Chief Mayawati was vocal while raising doubts over BJP getting maximum votes in UP and even went ahead asking for an investigation into the matter.

The report that an independent candidate from Mumbai who go zero votes even after casting a vote in his favor has got the EC thinking. “We have always stood for free and fair elections and this time around too we’d like it to be it that way. So we have decided to send EVMs for narco test. Machines would be sent to labs in Hyderabad,” said a senior official from the commission.

When questioned if re-elections would take place if the machines were tampered with, the official refused to comment.

Our reporter also visited the lab where a few EVMs were already being tested. One such machine fitted with electrodes was found lying on the bed with an attendant asking, “EVM listen to me. Did anyone tamper with you?”

Sources say that the process will be completed in a week and a decision regarding re-elections if any will be announced soon.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi welcomed the move and raised doubts that some EVMs come fitted with Chinese parts and it is important to have them checked. “Accha hai ki EVM ki surgery ho rahi hai. Kya ye machine China se bankar aati hai? Waha ke log bhi khush hote honge jab unhe pata chalta hoga ki hum Made in China ke EVM istamal karte hain.

Not wanting to concede defeat, Congress Party is hoping that a similar envelope would emerge from somewhere that will declare the party winner in UP assembly elections.

For the past 3 days, virtually the entire Indian government is in the city so they have decided to move the entire PMO there till the results for UP are declared.

Justifying the relocation of the PMO, a senior BJP minister said ,”Well,we can’t let elections affect the day to day functioning of the government. Since Modi Ji can’t go to Delhi right now, his staff can come here and work from here. We have already set up porta cabins along the length of Ganga river where they will work.”

When we asked why isn’t PM Modi going back after campaigning ends today, the minister said ,”As you know, we are fully reliant on Modi Ji for every election. The campaigning part may be getting over but he also has to do booth management. He will need to drive voters to and from the polling booths on polling day. After that, he will stand outside EC offices to keep a watch on the EVMs to ensure nobody tampers with them. So you see, we can’t spare him before the 11th.

No more drama

Since the former CM, late J Jayalalitha unfortunately passed away, Tamil Nadu politics has seen more twists and turns than Pune’s cricket pitch. O Panneerselvam became the stand-in CM for few days. He resigned a few days later and everyone thought that Sasikala will become the next CM. But then OPS dramatically withdrew his resignation becoming the CM once again but Sasikala managed to keep the MLAs on her side through her excellent hospitality in Golden bay Resort.

However, just when Sasikala was preparing to take oath, the Supreme court sentenced her to four years of imprisonment. To everybody’s surprise, E Palanisamy was declared as the next CM. His elevation to the CM chair was so unexpected that there wasn’t even a Wikipedia page in his name when he took oath of office.

Mr. JJ Swamy, a common man from Chennai speaking to Faking News said, “Tamil Nadu politics was so enthralling over the past few weeks. You never knew who would become the CM. The uncertainty made the politics entertaining and exciting. But now, it is the same CM for 2 weeks in a row, there is no chance of him being replaced either. It has all become a bit boring. To add to the boredom, even the Indian team lost their match within 3 days, leaving such a long gap between 1st and 2nd tests. What should a common man do for entertainment now?”

Mr. Rijiju is going there to check whether any student groups are fighting so that he can also join in, verbally, if not physically.

“Aa raha hoon main…. Aapke campus me”

After commenting on the recent fracas between AISA and ABVP at Ramjas college in Delhi, Mr Rijiju has again commented on the stand taken by a Kargil martyr’s daughter on Twitter. Now, he wants to get more actively involved in student politics and campus fights, and is actively seeking these fights.

Since a minister of state for home affairs has precious little responsibility otherwise, Mr Rijiju has a lot of time on his hands to roam around all the colleges in the city.

Confirming the news, a home ministry official said, “It is not that he will get involved in every fight. If he starts doing that, he will be trapped in 100 fights in one college alone, Delhi hai bhai. He is only looking for those fights where student gangs groups like ABVP, AISA, NSUI, SFI etc are involved. Unless there is a ‘National-Anti-National’ angle involved, there is no point in honorable minister joining in.”

When we asked if it will affect Mr. Rijiju’s work in the ministry, the official said ,”Don’t spin this to show that the minister isn’t focusing on his responsibilities as a minister. Working in home ministry, he is responsible for law and order inside the country. Colleges are a part of the country so he is just doing his job here.”

Parties that did not do well in the elections have raised concerns that the machines were manipulated to favor specific candidates.

BSP Chief Mayawati was vocal while raising doubts over BJP getting maximum votes in UP and even went ahead asking for an investigation into the matter.

The report that an independent candidate from Mumbai who go zero votes even after casting a vote in his favor has got the EC thinking. “We have always stood for free and fair elections and this time around too we’d like it to be it that way. So we have decided to send EVMs for narco test. Machines would be sent to labs in Hyderabad,” said a senior official from the commission.

When questioned if re-elections would take place if the machines were tampered with, the official refused to comment.

Our reporter also visited the lab where a few EVMs were already being tested. One such machine fitted with electrodes was found lying on the bed with an attendant asking, “EVM listen to me. Did anyone tamper with you?”

Sources say that the process will be completed in a week and a decision regarding re-elections if any will be announced soon.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi welcomed the move and raised doubts that some EVMs come fitted with Chinese parts and it is important to have them checked. “Accha hai ki EVM ki surgery ho rahi hai. Kya ye machine China se bankar aati hai? Waha ke log bhi khush hote honge jab unhe pata chalta hoga ki hum Made in China ke EVM istamal karte hain.

Not wanting to concede defeat, Congress Party is hoping that a similar envelope would emerge from somewhere that will declare the party winner in UP assembly elections.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi himself was confident that his party would be declared winner after the correct envelope would be read out.

Many Congress workers were already seen distributing sweets in anticipation. “Humein aasha hai ki Rahulji ka Made in Jaunpur ka sapna zaroor poora hoga. Bas ab intezaar hai sahi lifafa aane ka,” said the party spokesperson.

There was a momentary panic in the BJP camp after news of such an envelope made the rounds. But the fears were allayed later after the counting concluded with no sign of any changes in the result.

For the past 3 days, virtually the entire Indian government is in the city so they have decided to move the entire PMO there till the results for UP are declared.

PM Modi during his road show, or Jan Milan, we don’t know

The results for this Ashutosh Gowarikar directed elections are just 5 days away now so this will be a temporary arrangement and entire PMO staff will move back to Delhi next week.

Justifying the relocation of the PMO, a senior BJP minister said ,”Well,we can’t let elections affect the day to day functioning of the government. Since Modi Ji can’t go to Delhi right now, his staff can come here and work from here. We have already set up porta cabins along the length of Ganga river where they will work.”

When we asked why isn’t PM Modi going back after campaigning ends today, the minister said ,”As you know, we are fully reliant on Modi Ji for every election. The campaigning part may be getting over but he also has to do booth management. He will need to drive voters to and from the polling booths on polling day. After that, he will stand outside EC offices to keep a watch on the EVMs to ensure nobody tampers with them. So you see, we can’t spare him before the 11th.

No more drama

Since the former CM, late J Jayalalitha unfortunately passed away, Tamil Nadu politics has seen more twists and turns than Pune’s cricket pitch. O Panneerselvam became the stand-in CM for few days. He resigned a few days later and everyone thought that Sasikala will become the next CM. But then OPS dramatically withdrew his resignation becoming the CM once again but Sasikala managed to keep the MLAs on her side through her excellent hospitality in Golden bay Resort.

However, just when Sasikala was preparing to take oath, the Supreme court sentenced her to four years of imprisonment. To everybody’s surprise, E Palanisamy was declared as the next CM. His elevation to the CM chair was so unexpected that there wasn’t even a Wikipedia page in his name when he took oath of office.

Mr. JJ Swamy, a common man from Chennai speaking to Faking News said, “Tamil Nadu politics was so enthralling over the past few weeks. You never knew who would become the CM. The uncertainty made the politics entertaining and exciting. But now, it is the same CM for 2 weeks in a row, there is no chance of him being replaced either. It has all become a bit boring. To add to the boredom, even the Indian team lost their match within 3 days, leaving such a long gap between 1st and 2nd tests. What should a common man do for entertainment now?”

Mr. Rijiju is going there to check whether any student groups are fighting so that he can also join in, verbally, if not physically.

“Aa raha hoon main…. Aapke campus me”

After commenting on the recent fracas between AISA and ABVP at Ramjas college in Delhi, Mr Rijiju has again commented on the stand taken by a Kargil martyr’s daughter on Twitter. Now, he wants to get more actively involved in student politics and campus fights, and is actively seeking these fights.

Since a minister of state for home affairs has precious little responsibility otherwise, Mr Rijiju has a lot of time on his hands to roam around all the colleges in the city.

Confirming the news, a home ministry official said, “It is not that he will get involved in every fight. If he starts doing that, he will be trapped in 100 fights in one college alone, Delhi hai bhai. He is only looking for those fights where student gangs groups like ABVP, AISA, NSUI, SFI etc are involved. Unless there is a ‘National-Anti-National’ angle involved, there is no point in honorable minister joining in.”

When we asked if it will affect Mr. Rijiju’s work in the ministry, the official said ,”Don’t spin this to show that the minister isn’t focusing on his responsibilities as a minister. Working in home ministry, he is responsible for law and order inside the country. Colleges are a part of the country so he is just doing his job here.”

When we asked if it is safe for him to go alone to all these colleges,. the official said ,”Mr Rijiju is not a female that he can’t go out alone in Delhi.

This election is still going on!

Elections in India are always stretched out over several weeks as they are very good for the economy. All the cash kept in the homes of politicians comes out in circulation, several small scale industries make money manufacturing flags and banners, unemployed youth get the job of attending political rallies for good amount of money. As per experts, longer the election, greater the benefit to the country. However, this time the elections have been stretched so much that kids born after the announcement, like Ramesh, have also managed to reach voting age before the last phase.

“I have not decided who will get my vote but I am definitely going to go out and exercise my right. I have attended a few rallies but they were all about CM blaming PM and PM blaming CM, nobody mentioned why I should vote for them so they were a waste. I am doing some reading of their manifestos to finally decide”, Ramesh said while speaking to a Faking News reporter.

When asked about the long elections, an Election Commission official said ,”What is your problem man. Election season is the best season. This is the only season when politicians work hard, law and order improves, people get free alcohol, no scams take place. In fact we should be pushing for even longer elections.

Thousands of donkeys in the state have taken to the streets of Lucknow to protest against politicization of their community during the ongoing state elections.

They are coming!

It all started with the incumbent CM Akhilesh Yadav asking Bollywood superstar to stop doing ads promotion ‘Gujarat Ke Gadhe’. We still don’t know why he chose to bring that up. In response, PM Narendra Modi said that donkeys are very good animals who keep working for their masters even when they are hungry and tired.

Donkeys association has condemned both the statements and has asked the politicians to leave them alone. Speaking to Faking News, a leading member of donkey protest march said ,”What was the need for Akhilesh Yadav to drag us into politics? We were quietly going about our work without disturbing anyone but he had to needle us. Why shouldn’t Amitabh Bachchan do an ad featuring us? He promotes every single product in the world but Akhilesh ji doesn’t have a problem, he promotes our brothers and suddenly there is an outrage? Why this discrimination against us?”

“We are also not happy with Modi Ji. What does he mean when he says donkeys will keep working even when they are hungry. Is he telling our masters that they don’t need to feed us? We also need lunch break like any other worker bhai. Modi ji is supporting people who make us work long hours without giving us a break. We don’t even get overtime. This practice must be condemned, not glorified”, the donkey said.

From now on, staring at the cows will be a punishable offence, a law to that effect has been passed by the Gujarat assembly.

Cows will be safe in the state now!

Anyone caught staring at the cows will be detained by the newly formed ‘Pro-Bovine Squads’ in the state and will be prosecuted in accordance with the new law. Maximum punishment under this new law is 7 yrs imprisonment and 10 lakhs Rupees fine.

Confirming the new law, state CM Vijay Rupani said ,”We must aspire not only for a vegetarian Gujarat but also for a Gujarat where cows can roam freely without getting stared at. Cows should be free to go out at any time of the day or night without attracting stares from beef lovers. Protecting cows is our first and foremost duty and we are fully committed to that.”

When asked how will policemen know who is staring at a cow, Mr Rupani said ,”All members of our ‘Pro-Bovine Squad’ are veteran policemen.

Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who trashed Air India staffer with this slipper for not providing a business class seat has been extended an offer to join anti-romeo squad.

Speaking to Faking News, Director General of Police Mr. Javed Ahmed said, “As you are aware that the anti-romeo squad in functional in UP and the results are positive in the first couple of days itself. The only problem we are facing is the shortage of man power. We are constantly of the look out for talent and that is the reason why we have sent across an request to Mr. Gaikwad asking him to join the squad.”

“We have full faith in our MLAs that they won’t leave us but we have no faith in Amit Shah and his team of managers, they may manage everything. They have no political decency, at least let us rule the states where we are winning more states yaar.

Parties that did not do well in the elections have raised concerns that the machines were manipulated to favor specific candidates.

BSP Chief Mayawati was vocal while raising doubts over BJP getting maximum votes in UP and even went ahead asking for an investigation into the matter.

The report that an independent candidate from Mumbai who go zero votes even after casting a vote in his favor has got the EC thinking. “We have always stood for free and fair elections and this time around too we’d like it to be it that way. So we have decided to send EVMs for narco test. Machines would be sent to labs in Hyderabad,” said a senior official from the commission.

When questioned if re-elections would take place if the machines were tampered with, the official refused to comment.

Our reporter also visited the lab where a few EVMs were already being tested. One such machine fitted with electrodes was found lying on the bed with an attendant asking, “EVM listen to me. Did anyone tamper with you?”

Sources say that the process will be completed in a week and a decision regarding re-elections if any will be announced soon.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi welcomed the move and raised doubts that some EVMs come fitted with Chinese parts and it is important to have them checked. “Accha hai ki EVM ki surgery ho rahi hai. Kya ye machine China se bankar aati hai? Waha ke log bhi khush hote honge jab unhe pata chalta hoga ki hum Made in China ke EVM istamal karte hain. Lekin mujhe vishwas hai ki jald hi sach ka pata chal jayega,” he said while addressing party workers.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/evm_story_650_041714013204.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/evm-machines-undergo-narco-test-rule-tampering-19753,EVM machines to undergo narco test to rule out tampering,,1489297482.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Academy awards saw the biggest embarrassment in its history after presenters read out the wrong envelope mentioning La La Land as the winner, which was later corrected to Moonlight.

Not wanting to concede defeat, Congress Party is hoping that a similar envelope would emerge from somewhere that will declare the party winner in UP assembly elections.

Congress VP Rahul Gandhi himself was confident that his party would be declared winner after the correct envelope would be read out.

Many Congress workers were already seen distributing sweets in anticipation. “Humein aasha hai ki Rahulji ka Made in Jaunpur ka sapna zaroor poora hoga. Bas ab intezaar hai sahi lifafa aane ka,” said the party spokesperson.

There was a momentary panic in the BJP camp after news of such an envelope made the rounds. But the fears were allayed later after the counting concluded with no sign of any changes in the result.

For the past 3 days, virtually the entire Indian government is in the city so they have decided to move the entire PMO there till the results for UP are declared.

PM Modi during his road show, or Jan Milan, we don’t know

The results for this Ashutosh Gowarikar directed elections are just 5 days away now so this will be a temporary arrangement and entire PMO staff will move back to Delhi next week. Along with UP, results for few other states will also be declared on the 11th but we have forgotten the names of those states, its been that long!

Justifying the relocation of the PMO, a senior BJP minister said ,”Well,we can’t let elections affect the day to day functioning of the government. Since Modi Ji can’t go to Delhi right now, his staff can come here and work from here. We have already set up porta cabins along the length of Ganga river where they will work.”

When we asked why isn’t PM Modi going back after campaigning ends today, the minister said ,”As you know, we are fully reliant on Modi Ji for every election. The campaigning part may be getting over but he also has to do booth management. He will need to drive voters to and from the polling booths on polling day. After that, he will stand outside EC offices to keep a watch on the EVMs to ensure nobody tampers with them. So you see, we can’t spare him before the 11th. Once results are announced, he can go and do whatever he needs to.”

No more drama

Since the former CM, late J Jayalalitha unfortunately passed away, Tamil Nadu politics has seen more twists and turns than Pune’s cricket pitch. O Panneerselvam became the stand-in CM for few days. He resigned a few days later and everyone thought that Sasikala will become the next CM. But then OPS dramatically withdrew his resignation becoming the CM once again but Sasikala managed to keep the MLAs on her side through her excellent hospitality in Golden bay Resort.

However, just when Sasikala was preparing to take oath, the Supreme court sentenced her to four years of imprisonment. To everybody’s surprise, E Palanisamy was declared as the next CM. His elevation to the CM chair was so unexpected that there wasn’t even a Wikipedia page in his name when he took oath of office.

Mr. JJ Swamy, a common man from Chennai speaking to Faking News said, “Tamil Nadu politics was so enthralling over the past few weeks. You never knew who would become the CM. The uncertainty made the politics entertaining and exciting. But now, it is the same CM for 2 weeks in a row, there is no chance of him being replaced either. It has all become a bit boring. To add to the boredom, even the Indian team lost their match within 3 days, leaving such a long gap between 1st and 2nd tests. What should a common man do for entertainment now?”

Mr. Rijiju is going there to check whether any student groups are fighting so that he can also join in, verbally, if not physically.

“Aa raha hoon main…. Aapke campus me”

After commenting on the recent fracas between AISA and ABVP at Ramjas college in Delhi, Mr Rijiju has again commented on the stand taken by a Kargil martyr’s daughter on Twitter. Now, he wants to get more actively involved in student politics and campus fights, and is actively seeking these fights.

Since a minister of state for home affairs has precious little responsibility otherwise, Mr Rijiju has a lot of time on his hands to roam around all the colleges in the city.

Confirming the news, a home ministry official said, “It is not that he will get involved in every fight. If he starts doing that, he will be trapped in 100 fights in one college alone, Delhi hai bhai. He is only looking for those fights where student gangs groups like ABVP, AISA, NSUI, SFI etc are involved. Unless there is a ‘National-Anti-National’ angle involved, there is no point in honorable minister joining in.”

When we asked if it will affect Mr. Rijiju’s work in the ministry, the official said ,”Don’t spin this to show that the minister isn’t focusing on his responsibilities as a minister. Working in home ministry, he is responsible for law and order inside the country. Colleges are a part of the country so he is just doing his job here.”

Ramesh, who was born on the day Election Commission announced the dates for the UP elections, has managed to get his voter ID during this long, unending election campaign.

This election is still going on!

Elections in India are always stretched out over several weeks as they are very good for the economy. All the cash kept in the homes of politicians comes out in circulation, several small scale industries make money manufacturing flags and banners, unemployed youth get the job of attending political rallies for good amount of money. As per experts, longer the election, greater the benefit to the country. However, this time the elections have been stretched so much that kids born after the announcement, like Ramesh, have also managed to reach voting age before the last phase.

“I have not decided who will get my vote but I am definitely going to go out and exercise my right. I have attended a few rallies but they were all about CM blaming PM and PM blaming CM, nobody mentioned why I should vote for them so they were a waste. I am doing some reading of their manifestos to finally decide”, Ramesh said while speaking to a Faking News reporter.

When asked about the long elections, an Election Commission official said ,”What is your problem man. Election season is the best season. This is the only season when politicians work hard, law and order improves, people get free alcohol, no scams take place. In fact we should be pushing for even longer elections.

Thousands of donkeys in the state have taken to the streets of Lucknow to protest against politicization of their community during the ongoing state elections.

They are coming!

It all started with the incumbent CM Akhilesh Yadav asking Bollywood superstar to stop doing ads promotion ‘Gujarat Ke Gadhe’. We still don’t know why he chose to bring that up. In response, PM Narendra Modi said that donkeys are very good animals who keep working for their masters even when they are hungry and tired.

Donkeys association has condemned both the statements and has asked the politicians to leave them alone. Speaking to Faking News, a leading member of donkey protest march said ,”What was the need for Akhilesh Yadav to drag us into politics? We were quietly going about our work without disturbing anyone but he had to needle us. Why shouldn’t Amitabh Bachchan do an ad featuring us? He promotes every single product in the world but Akhilesh ji doesn’t have a problem, he promotes our brothers and suddenly there is an outrage? Why this discrimination against us?”

“We are also not happy with Modi Ji. What does he mean when he says donkeys will keep working even when they are hungry. Is he telling our masters that they don’t need to feed us? We also need lunch break like any other worker bhai. Modi ji is supporting people who make us work long hours without giving us a break. We don’t even get overtime. This practice must be condemned, not glorified”, the donkey said.

“What is happening in Parliament bhai?”

“Do you think at this age I became an MP, just to come to Parliament, sit inside this central AC hall, get up and leave after an adjournment, come back, sit, stand again for the next adjournment, leave, repeat for a month. Is this the way to treat senior leaders? At least ensure that the house gets adjourned for the day right at the start”, said Mr. Advani while speaking to us.

“Of course throughout these adjournments, we aren’t doing anything productive at all. People of the country say that HR managers do the least amount of the work followed by HR executives but even they work during December bhai. All of them are busy putting up decorations inside offices for Christmas and New Year. We aren’t even doing that much work”, an upset Advani added.

“One guy is telling read from my lips, another guy says I am available for debates now, let’s start. It is like a street fight between 2 people but without actual fighting. It is so embarrassing to watch all this”, said Mr. Advani.

Further, he added,”I am so bored ever since they put me in that retirement home called Maargdarshak Mandal. I look forward to parliament sessions as they provide me with a break from my normal routine. Now even here there is nothing to do. Debate something bhai, anything.

Sanjay started wondering this when his father failed to get even a single bundle of the new 2000 Rs notes even after a month of demonetisation.

Do you have any?

There have been raids all across India where IT department has recovered Hundreds of Crores in new currency. However, neither IT department, nor new currency bundles have entered Sanjay’s house.

“Throughout my childhood I thought that my father is a very influential figure. No teacher in my school ever raised their voice in front of me because everyone knew mera baap kaun hai. I never lacked for money and always got all the expensive gifts I wanted. However, I am yet to see a bundle of new 2000 Rs notes at home. What use is this influence if we can’t force even a single bank manager to oblige us?” wondered Sanjay.

“Daily there are news of multiple raids across the country. IT department is catching people all over the place with the new notes so the really influential people are obviously getting them.

After introducing cheating time for students, government is now targeting alcohol lovers to push towards cashless economy.

Bottle lo, Quarter free

Starting at 8 PM tonight, everyone who buys a bottle of alcohol at any wine shop will get a quarter of the same brand free. Wine shop owners can submit a weekly list of all the purchases from their shops and they will be reimbursed by the government for the free quarters they will give out. This scheme is likely to motivate a large number of Indians to use digital wallets.

“A large number of people have already switched over to cashless transactions during the past month but we really want to accelerate this switch. We looked at the most popular commodity and decided to introduce this scheme there to reach the largest group of people. Hopefully, this will make more people move to digital wallets”, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.

However, opposition has lashed out at the government for this step. There have been allegations that government is pushing people towards alcohol in order to promote its digital wallets. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal even tweeted about it. In his tweet, he said,”Mallya made alcohol, government offering free alcohol, what is the deal Modi Ji?”

Senior CPM leader Sitaram Yechury has also criticized this move and said that Modi is using cashless transactions for his political gains. “By offering free alcohol, Modi wants to increase his popularity in Kerala. However, we will not let him do that.”

“Tourism industry has taken a great hit ever since the terrorist son of headmaster Burhan Wani was killed by the security forces. Even though we have been throwing stones in streets across the valley, no tourist has shown the inclination to come and enjoy our hospitality. Now we have realized that our approach was wrong. We were just waiting for the tourists to come when we should be taking the initiative and informing the world about the excitement we offer in these parts”, the Hurriyat statement read.

“Adrenaline junkies roam around the world looking for adventure and excitement and that is the niche market we want to appeal to. Once you are here as a tourist, you will be living on the edge throughout your stay. At any time, a stone may come from any direction and hit you smack in the head.

Do Not Try This At Home

The event was organized to check the debating skills of students as well as their knowledge of the current issues facing the country. The event was restricted for students from standard 10th only as the school assumed they will be mature enough to know how parliament functions. Unfortunately for the school, the students were a bit too aware of Parliament’s proceedings.

“Extracurricular activities are very important in the overall development of a child so we decided to conduct a debate for them. Then we thought that if we are going to conduct a debate, might as well make it a Parliamentary debate. After all, some of these students can grow up to be future leaders of this country. We also thought that the students will become more politically aware while watching proceedings from the parliament while preparing, that would have helped them become better citizens going forward”, School Principal Mrs. Ahuja said while explaining the rationale behind holding this event.

“However, we were in for a shock once the event started. I was sitting there as the speaker of the house and the moment we started, some students charged towards my seat raising some slogans. Even those still in their chairs were screaming something unintelligible. I tried to calm them down and even used the famous Baith jaiye, baith Jaiye but to no avail. After about 5 minutes of shouting, one student threw a piece of paper towards me and shouted ‘WALKOUT’. Following that, all the students left the room one by one leaving me alone inside”, she added.

When we contacted the boy who threw the paper, he said,”Sir I am a big Aamir Khan fan and I am a method actor just like him. I studied Parliament’s proceedings and followed them. I don’t know why Principal Madam got upset.”

She made this statement after some ships of the Indian Navy were spotted in Bay of Bengal.

Get out of Bay of Bengal

Earlier yesterday, TMC had alleged that Modi is imposing emergency and trying to overthrow the elected government in Bengal by using Indian Army. Army sources had clarified that it is a regular exercise they conduct every year but this explanation wasn’t accepted by Mamata Di and her party.

“We have been reliably informed that Indian ships are present in Bay of Bengal. This is an assault on the federal structure of the country. When the bay is Bengal’s then that means only state government has jurisdiction there. How can Modi send the Navy there? Has he declared emergency? Is he planning to invade Bengal? He must realize that we are also ready for war”, Mamata Di said angrily.

“If Modi wants war then we are also fully prepared. If he is just trying to intimidate us so that we stop protesting against demonetization then he must know that we won’t get scared. I ask him to call back the Naval ships from Bay of Bengal as soon as possible as people are panicking right now amid the uncertainty”, she added.

Senior TMC leader Derek O’Brien also joined in and said,”There has never been an instance of a PM trying to invade one of the states of the country. I should know, I know every bit of trivia thanks to my job experience. Modi should call back his Navy else we will show him what Bengalis are made of.”

Several Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh, RS Surjewala called this hacking a cheap trick by BJP to tarnish the amazing personality of Rahul Gandhi.

A letter submitted to the Home Minister Rajnath Singh by Rahul Gandhi demanded that Z+ category security should be given to Rahul’s twitter account considering the attack by hackers.

Ravi Shankar Prasad, the current Union Minister holding Ministry of Information Technology, decided to respond to the letter. “Was Rahul Gandhi’s account actually hacked? I thought he was tweeting the truth for the first time. Anyway, he should be more careful with his digital presence. He should install firewall at his home network. If his account still gets hacked, I will demand resignation of Twitter CEO”, Mr Prasad said.

However, this response made Rahul Gandhi very angry. Speaking to Faking News, he said, “Why is Ravi Shankar Prasad responding when it is none of his concern. This is not about information or technology. This is about security within the country and Home Minister must respond. Why does he want me to build a firewall in my house?

Mr. Parrikar had made several strong statements after the surgical strikes across LoC in which he repeatedly said that terrorists will not dare to attack India now. He had also promised that they will gouge out the eyes of anyone who looks at India with an evil eye. Evidently, those strong statements haven’t deterred anyone.

“We really thought that there won’t be any more terror attacks. After all, Mr Parrikar himself said that now even a mouse can’t come towards India and here we had 3 terrorists. Not just the Defence Minister, everyone in his ministry is in a state of deep shock. If strong statements can’t stop terror attacks then what will?” Faking News source inside Defence Ministry said.

“Just a day back he had clearly said that we will gouge out your eyes and place them on your palms if you try and attack India but apparently nobody is paying attention to what we say during rallies. Maybe it is because of the fact that Pakistan has stopped the broadcast of all Indian channels, terrorists residing there didn’t get the message. We will launch an enquiry to find out the reasons. We are also trying to get minister saab out of the shock so that he can go and explain to PM why his statements couldn’t stop terror attacks”, he added.

Meanwhile, some defence experts have advised Mr Parrikar to follow Rajnath template and just restrict himself to kadi ninda of terror attacks.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/16parrikar.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manohar-parrikar-shocked-strong-statements-didnt-stop-terrorists-attacking-army-camp-18422,Manohar Parrikar shocked that his strong statements didn’t stop terrorists from attacking Army camp,,1480499239.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-modi-not-attending-parliament-standing-bank-queue-exchange-money-bjp-18338,"New Delhi: Ever since Narendra Modi announced demonetization on national TV, opposition parties have been protesting over it. Now they are demanding the presence of the Prime Minister in the Parliament to debate this issue but so far PM Modi hasn’t been seen inside either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha during this session.

2,000 Rupye exchange karwa do

Now BJP has come out and clarified that PM Modi couldn’t make time to attend Parliament proceedings since he is standing in queues outside banks to get 2,000 Rs exchanged for his daily use. As per the rules, a person can get 2,000 Rs worth of old notes exchanged, a limit that was set at 4,000 Rs earlier.

“Modi Ji immediately left for Japan after demonetization and then he had to make several visits within India so he has had no opportunity to get to a bank to get his money exchanged. Only during the past few days he has had some personal time and he is using the opportunity to get some cash in hand. He is standing in the queue outside a bank just like any common man, he has even hired a makeover artist to ensure he doesn’t get recognized in the queue”, a BJP spokesperson told Faking News.

“We know what is going to happen when he comes to Parliament, opposition MPs will shout, storm the well of the house, house gets adjourned, and everyone goes home. At least let him get some money to eat samosa during the time when house stays adjourned”, the spokesperson added.

When we asked why can’t other MPs fund the samosa of Mr Modi since he is nation’s PM, the spokesperson replied ,”There is such shortage of cash that even Congressis refused to buy stuff for Rahul Ji, that is why he went to get 4,000 Rs exchanged.

While the opinion remains divided on the positives and negatives of the step, everyone agrees that it has had an impact on everyone. One such group that has been severely affected by this step is the group of paid political supporters who attend political rallies.

Alleged Biryani

The group which attends political rallies to show support for every politician is suffering since demonetization as they are being paid with vegetable Biryani instead of their usual payment of Mutton Biryani.

“We were expecting shortage of cash after this demonetization so we didn’t ask for any cash payment to attend political rallies. However, we made it clear that we will still need a plate of Biryani and a Whiskey quarter to attend a rally. Every political party’s representative agreed but we had no idea that we will be backstabbed like this. They gave us veg Biryani and a desi pauvva after the rally”, an angry rally enthusiast said.

“WTF is veg Biryani, we asked for Biryani and we must get it, we didn’t ask for Pulao or boiled rice. If you didn’t have the money to pay for mutton then you should not have organized a rally in the first place. If it was Chicken, we would have still accommodated but veg Biryani, COME ON”, he screamed in frustration.

Political parties have become very concerned after this news leaked and are worried that nobody will come to attend their future rallies if this news got out.

“So much cash has become worthless paper after this move by Narendra Modi. Now either we can afford to pay them on the day before elections or for attending a rally, can’t afford both”, a politician said on the condition of anonymity.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sweet-n-Namkin-Veg-Biryani-002.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/no-cash-pay-mutton-people-offered-veg-biryani-instead-mutton-biryani-attend-political-rallies-18295,"With no cash to pay for Mutton, People being offered Veg Biryani instead of Mutton Biryani to attend political rallies",,1479546642.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

This has given opposition BJP a chance to corner ruling congress which made a lot of hue and cry few years back when BJP ministers were caught doing the same inside assembly.

Just browsing TOI

Like the old BJP ministers, the Karnataka minister has denied the allegations strongly. “First of all, why I would watch such stuff on a 5-inch smartphone, when I have an iMac with 100 mbps dedicated internet line at home”, said the minister with an angry tone while speaking to us.

The minister added, “There is no time for people like me to read newspapers. While attending functions, if I get some time, instead of sleeping on the dais, I go through some online newspapers.”

“Probably when I was going through TOI (The Online India), some mischievous journalist took the video and shared with opposition and news channels. My question to all my detractors, where it is written, one cannot read a widely circulated daily like TOI when you are at public places. In fact, I would say it was an off day for the newspaper by its own high standard. There was hardly anything for excitement”, said the minister.

The minister said, “If these people are so concerned, what our kids are learning from this, then let them bring certain level of censorship. For some pages they can easily do an adult check in online version, through GPS they can track the place from where one is accessing and put a warning i.e. to watch such stuffs, go to your private area immediately. Even better, they can ask newspaper to bring a separate edition only for private viewing, oops sorry, private reading by adults only.”

This happened after several SBI employees were seen working today during their holy lunch time.

Lunch home

Banks reopened today after the old 500 Rs and 1000 Rs notes were taken out of circulation. People thronged all the banks to submit the cash they had in those denominations. With ATMs still closed, several people lined up to withdraw some cash as well. This created huge rush at all the branches and long queues were spotted everywhere.

To deal with such crowds, some of the SBI employees decided to miss lunch for a day, something that has never happened before.

“This is all happening due to Modi government’s decision. SBI employees are missing their lunch hours now, this is worse than emergency. These guys go to office to have lunch and if they can’t do that due to the situation Modi created then what else is left for them”, spokesperson of a national party said.

A leader of a regional party said, “BJP supporters keep calling others anarchist but this is true anarchy, SBI employees missing lunch. Modi government is answerable for this situation they have created.”

Earlier, Vijay Goel was threatened by Rio Olympics organizers that they will cancel his accreditation after repeated rude behavior by the minister and his entourage. This behavior of Vijay Goel brought a lot of embarrassment for the country and Mr. Modi has decided to rescue Indian athletes in Olympic village by airlifting Mr. Goel out of there.

“As it is the Olympic games aren’t going well for us with no medal till now. On top of that, our Sports Minister is going around with his entourage conducting himself shamefully. We simply can’t let this continue. We had hoped that Rio organizers will cancel his accreditation but they also only gave a warning. Therefore, PM has decided to interfere himself and instructed Sushma Ji to airlift him out”, a PMO official said.

Furthermore, he added,”Our ministers should know that we are above the rules only inside the country. Outside India, we aren’t likely to get any special favors. Mr. Goel’s behavior has embarrassed all the athletes as well and made them very uncomfortable. When they should be preparing for their events, they are posing for selfies with Mr. Goel and each member of his personal contingent. If you want selfies with Indian athletes then get it done at the National games na, why else do we organize them now, nobody watches them.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-vipassana-delhi-najeeb-jung-16921,"Delhi: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who returned from Dharamsala’s popular vipassana center earlier today, is believed to have secretly written a new constitution for the state of Delhi. As per sources, this was the real reason he went on vipassana, to write the Delhi constitution in peace.

“Ab maine sanvidhaan padha hi nahin, likha bhi hai”

Kejriwal’s continuous tussle with LG Najeeb Jung and the Central government is believed to be the reason behind him penning a new constitution. “The new constitution will be for the Republic of New Delhi, the future name of National Capital Region. We don’t want any more argument with Mr. jung and since that is unavoidable with the present constitution, we are writing a new one for Delhi. This constitution will be quite flexible and amendments will be passed through referendums”, an AAP insider told Faking News.

“After Pranab Da gave a copy of the constitution, Kejriwal ji read it cover to cover and realized that there are giant loopholes in it. To rectify those errors and to make it a people-friendly constitution, he rewrote it. Since he wasn’t getting any free time in Delhi thanks to Modi ji, he took the cover of this vipassana”, he added.

We spoke to Ashutosh to check if he has any details about Kejriwal’s new constitution. “I can’t disclose any details right now but can confirm that Delhi constitution will be separate from that of the country. The biggest thing is that Arvind’s constitution will report to him, and LG will report to the constitution. We will present our constitution to the people of Delhi on the 15th of August.”

“What you guys should notice is my integrity and consistency. I opposed this bill in the Parliament during UPA Government and opposed it during NDA Government as well.

Every major city in the country is crying out for better drain management and finally, the government has decided to do something about it.

Mohenjo Daro, Coming soon to a CM Office near you

Union minister for urban development, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu has announced that government will be using the upcoming Hrithik Roshan starrer Mohenjo Daro to teach drain management to Indian states. The ancient settlement of Mohenjo Daro is known for its excellent drainage system and government is hoping that present day administrators learn something from it.

Addressing the media persons in Delhi, Mr. Naidu said, “You can see the state of our infrastructure today. It rains for 1 hour and roads are flooded. Whether it is North India or South India, this problem unites us all. Some people are swimming to work, some are catching fish in the streets, this situation is unacceptable. Therefore, we needed to take drastic measures. Sometimes you have to look back, to move forward and we decided to look at Mohenjo daro. We have spoken to Ashutosh Gowarikar and asked him to organize a special screening of Mohenjo Daro for all state CMs so that they can observe their infrastructure and learn a thing or two about drain management.”

“We all know Mohenjo Daro had one of the best water management systems and was one of the best planned cities of ancient times. Our politicians will watch the movie and will learn some insight into the techniques used by them in the movie. This should help prepare us better for next year’s Monsoons”, Mr. Naidu added.

When contacted for his reaction, Mr. Ashutosh Gowarikar expressed his happiness at this decision. He said, “I think it is good that government is using my films for education purposes. Next, they should show Lagaan to our cricket team to teach them a thing or two about beating England, test series against them is coming up soon.”

Prime Minister’s office has requested entries on MyGov website for the best possible way to eliminate Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. Best idea will be rewarded and implemented by the government.

Arvind Kejriwal waiting for an assassination attempt

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is well known for his penchant for mass marketing of his ideas. For one of his famous initiatives – Mann Ki Baat (a popular monthly radio program) – he often invites ideas from his countrymen and names some of them in the program. He is following the same model to deal with political opponents.

Earlier yesterday, a Viral Youtube video was uploaded by Mr. Arvind Kejriwal in which he claimed that the Prime Minister of India was trying to kill him. Upon watching the video, Narendra Modi decided that there is no need for secrecy anymore and he should involve his fellow countrymen in his task. After this, PMO started inviting entries on creative ways to provide ‘shaheedi’ to a modern day ‘krantikari’. Reportedly, the servers of the MyGov Website on which people were to present their ideas crashed within hours.

While the crash of the website is certainly due to heavy traffic surge but the success has predictably been interpreted differently by various political parties. While the BJP claims that the surge is due to Prime Minister’s popularity and receptiveness of his call among the countrymen, the Congress party has claimed credit for the entire idea saying the website and the crash would not have been possible if Rajiv Gandhi hadn’t brought Computers to India. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party has claimed that website crashed because every Indian logged on to plead for Arvind Ji’s life.

Although the countrymen have to wait for the PM’s program on Sunday to find out the innovative ideas that stood out, your reporter through his highly placed sources in the PMO found out the top ranked idea has been handpicked by the PM personally. The submission came from a certain Balman Khan who proposed the idea of running a person over with a driverless car while shooting from a bulletless rifle.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/52742605.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-invites-entries-mygov-website-ideas-eliminating-kejriwal-16703,Narendra Modi invites entries on MyGov website on ideas for eliminating Kejriwal,,1469700022.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Government will install a wax statue of Arnab Goswami at all major toll booths to make the politicians behave themselves.

One of the most dangerous places to work in India

Earlier, BJP’s Bahadur Singh Koli was caught on camera slapping a toll attendant in Rajasthan. Mr. Koli is a member of Lok Sabha from Bharatpur, Rajasthan. This is not the first incident of a politician slapping toll attendants after an argument and government has decided that they must put a stop to this now.

“We looked at various options. Removing tolls completely from India, arming toll attendants with AK47s, forming special toll attendants’ protection squads etc. We even thought about asking the politicians to avoid behaving like goons but none of them seemed very practical. Then we were watching an episode of The Newshour on YouTube and observed how every politician was meekly listening to Arnab scolding them. Eureka! We had our solution”, a senior official at Road Transport and Highway ministry said.

“Now we knew that politicians can behave when faced with Arnab but our next challenge was getting Arnab on every toll booth. We thought about putting up his posters but we ourselves have written there that no posters allowed. Then our minister saw some pics from Madame Tussauds museum on someone’s FB profile and we had our solution. We will make wax statues of Arnab and place them outside every toll booth. There will be a pre-recorded tape inside the wax statue and if an attendant is facing a threat from a politician, he can press a button and the statue will say ‘NEVER EVER EVER EVER NEVER EVER NEVER EVER’. If someone is still throwing his weight around, attendants can press the second button, then the statue will start screaming about VVIP RACISM”, the official explained.

When we asked a politician if this plan will work, he said,”What plan? Now we have to slap twice instead of once. One slap for the toll attendant, one for that statue.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/138866427.G8CXD80a.PunjabOct111108.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/toll-booths-wax-statue-arnab-goswami-save-attendants-getting-beaten-politicians-16686,Toll booths to have a wax statue of Arnab Goswami to save attendants from getting beaten up by politicians,,1469608548.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Once elections are done here, politicians will move on

Elections in UP are due early next year and all the major players have started working for it. Dalits form a significant percentage of the votes in the state and are considered crucial for victory.

Dalits have suddenly become the focus of every political party and every media outlet as the elections in UP draw close. Not used to people caring for them, several Dalits were feeling a bit uncomfortable but they have been assured now that this is not a long term situation.

“We know that this sudden attention may be daunting and some people may be nervous. Some people may even start thinking that we are actually going to work seriously towards social equality. We want to dispel all those notions at this early stage and assure our Dalit brothers that we will once again forget about them once elections in UP end. They can have 2 years away from the spotlight then till we remember them again during Lok Sabha 2019 elections. There is no secret plan to actually work for them”, a leading politician from a party fighting elections in UP said at a dinner in Delhi.

Adding his voice to the politician’s view, a senior news editor said,”Oh yes, even our interest is going to last as long as the interest of politicians. Once elections are over, we will stop writing articles on Dalit plight and move on to other important stories, like Virat-Anushka affair or SRK’s son’s cheeks or some other important news. This is just a temporary arrangement.”

Politicians have also dispelled the idea that UP elections will be decided on caste alone and have assured everyone that they will start religion based politics as well during the next quarter.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/up.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politicians-assure-dalits-will-forgotten-elections-16681,Politicians assure Dalits that they will be forgotten again after UP elections,,1469598449.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mulayam-scolds-party-men-falling-behind-bjp-bsp-making-controversial-statements-16671,"Lucknow: Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has lashed out at his own party’s leaders today for falling behind rivals BSP and BJP in making controversial statements. As UP elections approach fast, Mulayam Singh is not happy at all with this lethargy among his cadre. Elections in India’s most populous state are likely to happen in 1st quarter of 2017.

Where are our controversial statements bhai?

Speaking at a party meet in Lucknow, Mulayam Singh scolded every leader present and asked them to work hard to embarrass the party during their speeches. Earlier, a BJP leader Dayashankar Singh had made objectionable comments about BSP supremo Mayawati which led to his expulsion from BJP. BSP leaders responded by making objectionable comments about Dayashankar’s family. This has hurt Mr. Mulayam that Samajwadi party wasn’t named at all during this entire event.

“Elections are just a few months away and all our leaders are sleeping? BJP leader made stupid statement, BSP responded with stupid comments, where is SP? Aise aayega Samajwad? Our leaders must understand that if we are not audible now, nobody will hear our plea for votes on the Election Day. Samajwadi Party had led everyone else for 2 decades in the race to make controversial statements, we are not going to fall behind now”, Mulayam Singh told our reporter.

“We have the best players in the game. Azam Khan is there, Beni Prasad is there, Shivpal can also deliver. Amar Singh can always come up with a googly and where is that Totaram Yadav. Earlier I could have managed myself but now I am too old for this. I have to act like a statesman but all these other leaders should play on the front foot. We can’t be seen as more sensible than the other parties”, Mulayam added.

After Mulayam Singh’s scolding, both Azam Khan and Beni Prasad Verma have called their press conferences to make statements which are likely to keep the news channels busy for at elast the next fortnight.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mulayam.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mulayam-scolds-party-men-falling-behind-bjp-bsp-making-controversial-statements-16671,Mulayam scolds his party men for falling behind BJP and BSP in making controversial statements,,1469519272.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While Sidhu did say that he resigned from Rajya Sabha seat because he was unhappy, he didn’t reveal his future plans and instead unleashed some shayari.

Sidhu with his translator

Now to make sense of his statements, Political parties have approached Kapil Sharma, a man who always seems to understand what Sidhu is saying during his TV show. A panel comprising members from BJP, AAP and Congress has approached Kapil and asked him to translate Sidhu’s statements for common people.

“Why couldn’t Sidhu say in a simple sentence what he is going to do? Khata-Wafa-Maza-Saza, what was all that man. He said he was unhappy, that we all knew anyway. Of course he was unhappy that is why he resigned. Now what next? Whether he is joining AAP or accepting Amarinder’s invitation to join Congress or staying with BJP, who will clarify all that? Hopefully Kapil can make some sense of all those shers”, a senior Punjab politician said.

Not everyone wants Sidhu to join their party though. A leader speaking on the condition of anonymity said,”If he starts speaking in public rallies like that, it may really hurt our chances. People will think they have come to a Mushaira and not a political rally. How will we get our point across that public has to vote for our candidate and not select the best sher from Sidhu’s collection? Na baba, hum uske bina hi ache.”

Meanwhile, Kapil Sharma has agreed to help out the politicians on the condition that they let him shoot the next season of ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’ inside the Punjab assembly. “Our show needs some strange characters in the audience. If we shoot it in Punjab assembly, we will get plenty of them and Sidhu Paaji will still remain our chief guest”, Kapil said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/57927baa7559c.image_.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-parties-request-kapil-sharma-explain-exactly-sidhu-said-press-conference-16666,Political parties request Kapil Sharma to explain what exactly Sidhu said in his Press Conference,,1469513178.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“What is happening in Parliament bhai?”

“Do you think at this age I became an MP, just to come to Parliament, sit inside this central AC hall, get up and leave after an adjournment, come back, sit, stand again for the next adjournment, leave, repeat for a month. Is this the way to treat senior leaders? At least ensure that the house gets adjourned for the day right at the start”, said Mr. Advani while speaking to us.

“Of course throughout these adjournments, we aren’t doing anything productive at all. People of the country say that HR managers do the least amount of the work followed by HR executives but even they work during December bhai. All of them are busy putting up decorations inside offices for Christmas and New Year. We aren’t even doing that much work”, an upset Advani added.

“One guy is telling read from my lips, another guy says I am available for debates now, let’s start. It is like a street fight between 2 people but without actual fighting. It is so embarrassing to watch all this”, said Mr. Advani.

Further, he added,”I am so bored ever since they put me in that retirement home called Maargdarshak Mandal. I look forward to parliament sessions as they provide me with a break from my normal routine. Now even here there is nothing to do. Debate something bhai, anything. If nothing else, debate the quality of the new Humma song and compare it with Remo’s version but do something man.”

Sanjay started wondering this when his father failed to get even a single bundle of the new 2000 Rs notes even after a month of demonetisation.

Do you have any?

There have been raids all across India where IT department has recovered Hundreds of Crores in new currency. However, neither IT department, nor new currency bundles have entered Sanjay’s house.

“Throughout my childhood I thought that my father is a very influential figure. No teacher in my school ever raised their voice in front of me because everyone knew mera baap kaun hai. I never lacked for money and always got all the expensive gifts I wanted. However, I am yet to see a bundle of new 2000 Rs notes at home. What use is this influence if we can’t force even a single bank manager to oblige us?” wondered Sanjay.

“Daily there are news of multiple raids across the country. IT department is catching people all over the place with the new notes so the really influential people are obviously getting them. I have raised this point with my dad but since 8th November, he is too shocked to react to anything”, Sanjay added.

After introducing cheating time for students, government is now targeting alcohol lovers to push towards cashless economy.

Bottle lo, Quarter free

Starting at 8 PM tonight, everyone who buys a bottle of alcohol at any wine shop will get a quarter of the same brand free. Wine shop owners can submit a weekly list of all the purchases from their shops and they will be reimbursed by the government for the free quarters they will give out. This scheme is likely to motivate a large number of Indians to use digital wallets.

“A large number of people have already switched over to cashless transactions during the past month but we really want to accelerate this switch. We looked at the most popular commodity and decided to introduce this scheme there to reach the largest group of people. Hopefully, this will make more people move to digital wallets”, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.

However, opposition has lashed out at the government for this step. There have been allegations that government is pushing people towards alcohol in order to promote its digital wallets. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal even tweeted about it. In his tweet, he said,”Mallya made alcohol, government offering free alcohol, what is the deal Modi Ji?”

Senior CPM leader Sitaram Yechury has also criticized this move and said that Modi is using cashless transactions for his political gains. “By offering free alcohol, Modi wants to increase his popularity in Kerala. However, we will not let him do that.”

Meanwhile, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar who has support demonetization so far, has asked all newspapers in Bihar to avoid carrying this news lest it creates a situation of civil unrest. “Inhe paise me nahi mil rahi, log baahar free me le rahe hain, dange na ho jaayein”, he reportedly said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/signature-whisky.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/governments-digital-push-quarter-free-every-whiskey-bottle-use-digital-wallets-payment-18551,Government’s Digital Push: Quarter free with every Whiskey bottle if you use digital wallets for payment,,1481283387.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The statement urges lovers of adventure tourism to visit the valley and enjoy the stones of various sizes thrown towards them.

Kuch din to guzaariye Kashmir me

“Tourism industry has taken a great hit ever since the terrorist son of headmaster Burhan Wani was killed by the security forces. Even though we have been throwing stones in streets across the valley, no tourist has shown the inclination to come and enjoy our hospitality. Now we have realized that our approach was wrong. We were just waiting for the tourists to come when we should be taking the initiative and informing the world about the excitement we offer in these parts”, the Hurriyat statement read.

“Adrenaline junkies roam around the world looking for adventure and excitement and that is the niche market we want to appeal to. Once you are here as a tourist, you will be living on the edge throughout your stay. At any time, a stone may come from any direction and hit you smack in the head. You will be on the edge throughout wondering where the next stone is coming from. If that doesn’t excite you enough, you can do role reversal and join the stone pelters. That is double the excitement, you feel the rush of throwing stones and at the same time, you never know when a security official takes aim at you with a pellet gun. Even they seem to come from all sides like our stones”, the statement further added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/school-organizes-mock-parliament-students-students-throw-paper-principal-walk-18502,"Panchkula: A mock Parliament organized in a local school became a bit too realistic today when the students just threw paper at the Principal (who was acting as the speaker) and walked out of the room.

Do Not Try This At Home

The event was organized to check the debating skills of students as well as their knowledge of the current issues facing the country. The event was restricted for students from standard 10th only as the school assumed they will be mature enough to know how parliament functions. Unfortunately for the school, the students were a bit too aware of Parliament’s proceedings.

“Extracurricular activities are very important in the overall development of a child so we decided to conduct a debate for them. Then we thought that if we are going to conduct a debate, might as well make it a Parliamentary debate. After all, some of these students can grow up to be future leaders of this country. We also thought that the students will become more politically aware while watching proceedings from the parliament while preparing, that would have helped them become better citizens going forward”, School Principal Mrs. Ahuja said while explaining the rationale behind holding this event.

“However, we were in for a shock once the event started. I was sitting there as the speaker of the house and the moment we started, some students charged towards my seat raising some slogans. Even those still in their chairs were screaming something unintelligible. I tried to calm them down and even used the famous Baith jaiye, baith Jaiye but to no avail. After about 5 minutes of shouting, one student threw a piece of paper towards me and shouted ‘WALKOUT’. Following that, all the students left the room one by one leaving me alone inside”, she added.

When we contacted the boy who threw the paper, he said,”Sir I am a big Aamir Khan fan and I am a method actor just like him. I studied Parliament’s proceedings and followed them. I don’t know why Principal Madam got upset.”

Meanwhile, the school has decided not to hold any more events like this in future.

She made this statement after some ships of the Indian Navy were spotted in Bay of Bengal.

Get out of Bay of Bengal

Earlier yesterday, TMC had alleged that Modi is imposing emergency and trying to overthrow the elected government in Bengal by using Indian Army. Army sources had clarified that it is a regular exercise they conduct every year but this explanation wasn’t accepted by Mamata Di and her party.

“We have been reliably informed that Indian ships are present in Bay of Bengal. This is an assault on the federal structure of the country. When the bay is Bengal’s then that means only state government has jurisdiction there. How can Modi send the Navy there? Has he declared emergency? Is he planning to invade Bengal? He must realize that we are also ready for war”, Mamata Di said angrily.

“If Modi wants war then we are also fully prepared. If he is just trying to intimidate us so that we stop protesting against demonetization then he must know that we won’t get scared. I ask him to call back the Naval ships from Bay of Bengal as soon as possible as people are panicking right now amid the uncertainty”, she added.

Senior TMC leader Derek O’Brien also joined in and said,”There has never been an instance of a PM trying to invade one of the states of the country. I should know, I know every bit of trivia thanks to my job experience. Modi should call back his Navy else we will show him what Bengalis are made of.”

Soon after Mamata Di made the allegations, Faking News spoke to an Indian Navy spokesperson for a reaction to her statements, he said ,”Yaar….

Though the abusive tweets were taken down hours later, the screenshots of these tweets will live forever like LK Advani. Several Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh, RS Surjewala called this hacking a cheap trick by BJP to tarnish the amazing personality of Rahul Gandhi.

A letter submitted to the Home Minister Rajnath Singh by Rahul Gandhi demanded that Z+ category security should be given to Rahul’s twitter account considering the attack by hackers.

Ravi Shankar Prasad, the current Union Minister holding Ministry of Information Technology, decided to respond to the letter. “Was Rahul Gandhi’s account actually hacked? I thought he was tweeting the truth for the first time. Anyway, he should be more careful with his digital presence. He should install firewall at his home network. If his account still gets hacked, I will demand resignation of Twitter CEO”, Mr Prasad said.

However, this response made Rahul Gandhi very angry. Speaking to Faking News, he said, “Why is Ravi Shankar Prasad responding when it is none of his concern. This is not about information or technology. This is about security within the country and Home Minister must respond. Why does he want me to build a firewall in my house? Does he want to burn my house?”

Seven soldiers were martyred in Nagrota after it was attacked by 3 terrorists wearing police uniforms.

“Did they not hear what I said?”

Mr. Parrikar had made several strong statements after the surgical strikes across LoC in which he repeatedly said that terrorists will not dare to attack India now. He had also promised that they will gouge out the eyes of anyone who looks at India with an evil eye. Evidently, those strong statements haven’t deterred anyone.

“We really thought that there won’t be any more terror attacks. After all, Mr Parrikar himself said that now even a mouse can’t come towards India and here we had 3 terrorists. Not just the Defence Minister, everyone in his ministry is in a state of deep shock. If strong statements can’t stop terror attacks then what will?” Faking News source inside Defence Ministry said.

“Just a day back he had clearly said that we will gouge out your eyes and place them on your palms if you try and attack India but apparently nobody is paying attention to what we say during rallies. Maybe it is because of the fact that Pakistan has stopped the broadcast of all Indian channels, terrorists residing there didn’t get the message. We will launch an enquiry to find out the reasons. We are also trying to get minister saab out of the shock so that he can go and explain to PM why his statements couldn’t stop terror attacks”, he added.

Now they are demanding the presence of the Prime Minister in the Parliament to debate this issue but so far PM Modi hasn’t been seen inside either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha during this session.

2,000 Rupye exchange karwa do

Now BJP has come out and clarified that PM Modi couldn’t make time to attend Parliament proceedings since he is standing in queues outside banks to get 2,000 Rs exchanged for his daily use. As per the rules, a person can get 2,000 Rs worth of old notes exchanged, a limit that was set at 4,000 Rs earlier.

“Modi Ji immediately left for Japan after demonetization and then he had to make several visits within India so he has had no opportunity to get to a bank to get his money exchanged. Only during the past few days he has had some personal time and he is using the opportunity to get some cash in hand. He is standing in the queue outside a bank just like any common man, he has even hired a makeover artist to ensure he doesn’t get recognized in the queue”, a BJP spokesperson told Faking News.

“We know what is going to happen when he comes to Parliament, opposition MPs will shout, storm the well of the house, house gets adjourned, and everyone goes home. At least let him get some money to eat samosa during the time when house stays adjourned”, the spokesperson added.

When we asked why can’t other MPs fund the samosa of Mr Modi since he is nation’s PM, the spokesperson replied ,”There is such shortage of cash that even Congressis refused to buy stuff for Rahul Ji, that is why he went to get 4,000 Rs exchanged.

While the opinion remains divided on the positives and negatives of the step, everyone agrees that it has had an impact on everyone. One such group that has been severely affected by this step is the group of paid political supporters who attend political rallies.

Alleged Biryani

The group which attends political rallies to show support for every politician is suffering since demonetization as they are being paid with vegetable Biryani instead of their usual payment of Mutton Biryani.

“We were expecting shortage of cash after this demonetization so we didn’t ask for any cash payment to attend political rallies. However, we made it clear that we will still need a plate of Biryani and a Whiskey quarter to attend a rally. Every political party’s representative agreed but we had no idea that we will be backstabbed like this. They gave us veg Biryani and a desi pauvva after the rally”, an angry rally enthusiast said.

“WTF is veg Biryani, we asked for Biryani and we must get it, we didn’t ask for Pulao or boiled rice. If you didn’t have the money to pay for mutton then you should not have organized a rally in the first place. If it was Chicken, we would have still accommodated but veg Biryani, COME ON”, he screamed in frustration.

Political parties have become very concerned after this news leaked and are worried that nobody will come to attend their future rallies if this news got out.

Banks reopened today after the old 500 Rs and 1000 Rs notes were taken out of circulation. People thronged all the banks to submit the cash they had in those denominations. With ATMs still closed, several people lined up to withdraw some cash as well. This created huge rush at all the branches and long queues were spotted everywhere.

To deal with such crowds, some of the SBI employees decided to miss lunch for a day, something that has never happened before.

“This is all happening due to Modi government’s decision. SBI employees are missing their lunch hours now, this is worse than emergency. These guys go to office to have lunch and if they can’t do that due to the situation Modi created then what else is left for them”, spokesperson of a national party said.

A leader of a regional party said, “BJP supporters keep calling others anarchist but this is true anarchy, SBI employees missing lunch. Modi government is answerable for this situation they have created.”

When we asked an SBI employee to check whether some of his colleagues are indeed skipping lunch, he said ,”Baad me aana, abhi lunch time hai.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sbi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sbi-employee-spotted-working-lunch-today-opposition-alleges-emergency-18187,"SBI employee spotted working during lunch today, opposition alleges emergency",,1478766013.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/popular-personalities-views-on-how-the-next-rbi-governor-should-be-after-raghuram-rajan-10121,"As the exit of Raghuram Rajan has attracted attention of people and media across the countries, speculation about the next governor is at all time high. Some popular personalities have shared views on the next RBI governor to a media house. Their views are as follows

Trupti Desai:

She says “A woman should be the next RBI governor, as no woman has been made the governor after Independence”. She accused govt. of being misogynist, and further said “Govt. doesn’t allows women to enter in governor’s office, they think women as a curse for Indian economy, if they don’t make a woman as a RBI governor, then I will trespass governor’s office and sit in its chair.”

Mayawati:

She said, “Govt. of india doesn’t elect a dalit as a RBI governor”. She accused govt. as anti dalit and said, “There must a reservation in RBI governor’s post to uplift backward and minority sections”. She said she is planning to make this as an election issue in the next UP election.

Subramaniam Swamy:

He said that he is demanding govt. to make a “Kattar hindu” as the next RBI governor. He further added, “India has always lacked a kattar hindu in governor’s position. A kattar hindu will only understand Indian economy, as India is an hindu dominant country and all Indians have hindu DNA.”

Rahul Gandhi:

He said, “We need a governor who has Gandhi as a last name to uplift Indian economy. If Gandhi’s can rule India for 60 years, then why cannot a Gandhi be the next RBI governor.” He accused current government as anti-gandhi.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Raghuram-Rajan1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/popular-personalities-views-on-how-the-next-rbi-governor-should-be-after-raghuram-rajan-10121,Popular personalities views on how the next RBI governor should be after Raghuram Rajan,,1466835021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-offered-lead-role-in-conjuring-3-after-he-repeatedly-declared-that-modi-is-scared-of-him-10088,"New Delhi: Nation’s most talented actor and seasoned politician Mr. Arvind Kejriwal has been offered a lead role in Hollywood horror movie Conjuring (part 3) after he repeatedly declared that Modi and several other politicians in the country were quite scared of him.

Proposed poster for Conjuring 3

“Mr. Kejriwal has been talking about his scary persona in his weekly press conferences for a very long time now”, Said Nelly Stevenson, executive casting director for Conjuring 3. “The other day, I actually paused my TV, and looked at his angry face and realized that he indeed can look very scary, even without any makeup or VFX. We had a quick meeting and decided to extend him the role for deadliest evil spirit in the movie. This spirit will, as usual, scare the folks in the family, and will immediately flee the scene if it senses any attempt at exorcism by the lead ghostbuster which will be played by Irrfan Khan. Some portions of Conjuring 3 would be shot in India, so Mr. Kejriwal’s accent and way of speaking will be well suited. Especially the way he points a finger towards the screen while making an angry face, damn scary”, Nelly said.

Rumors have it that Mr. Kejriwal has not only accepted the role but also has started preparing for it. Addressing a mass rally of 29 volunteers, 13 on-lookers and 137 reporters, he said, “Yaar aaj ki date me, honest movie makers are not getting the right traction, as you all can see from Udta Punjab fiasco. This is the reason why I have decided to enter this industry and clean it up from within. You guys might have heard that I have accepted a horror movie role. I have accepted the role only because of Modi. I know Modi is scared of me and I want to scare him even more. Modi ji ko CD bhejunga movie ki, jab ban jayegi, na darein to mera naam badal dena.” He then pointed his finger towards media and stuck an angry pose for 15 seconds to emphasize how scary he can actually be.

Veteran AAP leader Ashutosh who was present at the rally also commented on Kejriwal ji’s acceptance of the role. He said, “I was really happy about Arvind expecting the role offer. Just that in his speech just now, he said ‘accepted the role’, but the correct phrase here is ‘expected the role’. Indian politics is cool about language, but now when he is going to Hollywood, his grammar and dictation (diction) should be perfect.”

While opposition leaders have declined to comment on this incident, Kejriwal ji has gone a step further and announced that he also plans to write the movie review for Conjuring 3,much in advance,even before this film is released, as he would know the whole story upfront. The film will be released in United States as Conjuring 3:The Evil Awakens and in India as Udta Pishaach : Meri Jung.

Censor board however has already indicated that most of Kejriwal’s scenes will be edited out of the film due to possible scary impact on voters in all future elections. Pahlaj Nihalani has denied reports that he is doing it as they may scare Narendra Modi.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-arvind-raid.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-offered-lead-role-in-conjuring-3-after-he-repeatedly-declared-that-modi-is-scared-of-him-10088,Kejriwal offered lead role in Conjuring 3 after he repeatedly declared that Modi is scared of him,,1466590701.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/no-interest-in-2nd-term-as-they-send-me-to-papua-new-guinea-while-pm-visits-us-pranab-mukherjee-10045,"New Delhi: According to our reliable sources, the exact reason President Pranab Mukherjee is not opting for 2nd term is the kind of countries the current NDA government is making him visit. The President visited Papua New Guinea and Ghana recently while PM Narendra Modi just visited Switzerland and USA among other countries.

Bored Pranab Mukherjee speaking to flowers to kill time

One of the senior officials of Rashtrapati Bhavan speaking on the condition of anonymity said, “First of all, our constitution does not allow a President to do much work in the first place. Apart from posing with the tulips, there really isn’t much to do. Little bit of work President is supposed to do is to sign the bills once they pass in both houses of Parliament. Both houses of Parliament working at the same time is as rare an event as the sighting of Halley’s comet, where is the question of bills getting passed and coming to him for signature?”

The official added, “The President is bored of staying inside Rashtrapati Bhavan. I agree it has 340 rooms and some large gardens, but we have a President who is a veteran politician. He has worked as a senior minister in so many previous governments; he has visited Rashtrapati Bhavan multiple times and has seen it all. When he does get a chance to visit abroad, he doesn’t quite get the type of cool countries that PM Modi gets. ”

Further explaining it, he said,”I mean look at it. He went to China, no freedom. Papua New Guinea, 95% of Indians don’t even know where it is. Then there is Ghana, right after the tensions with African representatives and he had to go to Palestine, Israel and Jordan, every moment he was wondering whether he is about to become the headline of a major incident.”

“In comparison, you have Modi Ji visiting US multiple times, visiting Switzerland, why can’t he let Pranab Da visit a few of those countries. Pratibha Ji had shown during her tenure that a President can travel more than the PM if supported by the government. Unless the government supports this demand, don’t think Pranab da is going to seek another term”, the official said.

Akhilesh made this request after journalists started blaming BJP MP Hema Malini for violence in Mathura.

Blame me once yaar

“We really appreciate the fact that journalists never blame Akhilesh Ji for any incident. Be it Muzzafarnagar or Dadri or Mathura, Akhilesh Ji is never held responsible for poor state of law and order. But now the elections are approaching and we do want people to remember who is their CM. They must remember that it was Akhilesh Ji who gave them all those free laptops and cycles so we request our friends in media to blame Akhilesh Ji for at least one incident to remind janta that Akhilesh Ji is the CM”, a spokesperson for Samajwadi Party said.

When we asked Akhilesh Yadav about it, he did confirm that he has made this request. “All my uncles opposed my elevation as CM and now when I don’t get blame for any violent incident, they come and tell Papa that I am totally irrelevant. This is not good in election year so I have asked media to do their job honestly and blame me for deteriorating law and order situation in the state”, the UP Chief Minister said.

When we asked Akhilesh whether it won’t bring negative attention, he smiled and said ,”Are you new to UP? Since when did law and order become an election issue here? We just need this news to remind people that I am the Chief Minister and I was the one who donated all those laptops with the screensaver of Neta Ji.”

Meanwhile, serious discussions were taking place across news channels to decide the issue on which Akhilesh can be criticised. “We are thinking about blaming him for a cycle theft in Ghaziabad. His party symbol will also get promoted”, said a senior editor at a news channel.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/283863-akhilesh-yadav-pc-700.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/akhilesh-yadav-requests-media-to-blame-him-too-once-in-a-while-so-that-people-dont-forget-he-is-cm-9986,Akhilesh Yadav requests media to blame him too once in a while so that people don't forget he is CM,,1465107311.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-to-introduce-pradhan-mantri-hawai-yatra-cess-during-next-mann-ki-baat-by-the-pm-9984,"New Delhi: In yet another taxing move to get more tax revenue from the taxpayers, Government of India has decided to introduce a 0.5% Pradhan Mantri Hawai Yatra Cess on all services and serviceable goods. It is being rumored that this tax will be announced during next “Mann ki baat” by PM on radio.

As per sources, this is Government’s way of making people feel less bad about paying Income Tax. “We will add so many additional cess that people will start thinking ‘Isse achha to Income Tax hi tha‘, it might help us in broadening the tax base as well in the long run”, said a senior officer at the Finance ministry.

Say Hello to another cess

Sanjeet Somesh, a veteran chartered accountant and an expert on Governmental Taxation policies commented on this move and said, “All the foreign trips and tours are actually very costly to the country. Air-tickets, hotels, food, luggage, parties, site-seeing and what not, all this costs log of money, and this particular “Pradhan Mantri hawai Yatra Cess” will fund all those crucial foreign trips at a very minor additional cost to the exchequer. And let me clarify what I mean by “costly trips” here. When people imagine our PM traveling they think of it as one person traveling in one Boeing 747. But it is actually a kafila of planes with security personnel, diplomats, and also all the bureaucrats who are due for a foreign holiday. We have to fund all of them as well.”

While people who are already paying 400 rupees of taxes, charges and cess on every 1000 rupee restaurant bill are revolting because of this additional tax implication, it is also being rumored that this tax may be one of the first in the list of innovative taxes government is planning. According to sources, few other taxes that may get announced in next Mann Ki Baat are:

1) Dr Swamy Court Yatra cess – Cess to cover the legal fees for numerous court cases Dr. Swamy has filed against celebrity politicians

2) Dawood Ibrahim dharpakad yojna cess – Millions of dollars being spent on intelligence agencies to locate and capture Dawood Ibrahim outside Pakistan, while he is in Pakistan

3) Sir Barack Obama Swagat Sussajja cess – Lakhs of rupees spent on celebrations and decorations when Sir Barack Obama (or Trump next year) visits India in capacity of US President

Taking a cue from these central government taxes, even Aam Aadmi party is planning to levy some specific state taxes in Delhi such as “Mukhyamantri Punjab Yatra cess”, “Mukhyamantri Telecalling Namashkar ji cess”, “Odd-even Safalta Inaam Yojna cess” and “Swachh Degree Jaanchpadtaal cess”.

Can Chhota Bheem make it to the Congress Party

Senior leaders however dismissed the rumors saying that Chhota Bheem lacks what it takes to be the vice president of Congress party.

Speaking to Faking News Digvijay Singh spoke on the issue and said, “Let me start by congratulating Rahulji for becoming the President of the party. He truly deserves the place. I believe there are some rumors flying around that Chhota Bheem would take over from Rahul, but all this is just speculation. Congress party has not issued any official statement on it.”

“Forget vice president, Chhota Bheem wouldn’t make it as party worker. To tell you honestly, he lacks what it takes to be at top in the Congress party. Chhota Bheem is not from Gandhi family. It would be foolish to expect him to lead the party. Besides it seems he has done a lot of work for the kingdom of Dholakpur, which goes against the unwritten rule of our party,” he added

Other Congress leaders too expressed their displeasure at Bheem’s name being proposed for a party post. “Even if these are rumors, I’d be very upset. How can a cartoon character be elevated as second in command to Rahul Gandhi. I mean what has Chhota Bheem done to deserve that post. I have spent 30 years in the party picking chappals of senior leaders, it would be unfair if the party doesn’t consider my contribution,” said a Congress Party veteran who didn’t wish to be named, looking visibly upset with the rumors.

Rajya Sabha MP Subramaniam Swamy said that he wouldn’t be amused even if this speculation turned out to be true. “Honestly I won’t be surprised. Rahul is a cartoon, so it would be apt if we have two cartoon characters holding top positions of the party. Let them make it official,” said Mr. Swamy with a snigger.

Meanwhile, BJP welcomed Rahul Gandhi’s elevation. Party workers were seen distributing sweets and bursting crackers at party headquarters. “We are already celebrating our victory in 2019 elections.

Gurgaon City’s name was changed to Gurugram recently.

Gurugram at night

Residents of Gurugram are facing severe power cuts these days. In some cases, the power supply was off throughout the night as well. However, CM has now assured everyone that there is no shortage of power.

“We understand that some residents are facing a bit of an inconvenience but we seek their support during this transition to Gurugram. When we are renaming Gurgaon city to Gurugram, we must ensure that power supply here mirrors the power supply that people in other grams (villages) receive. Opposition parties will try to raise this issue as one of power shortage but rest assured, we have enough power to not only meet our own needs but to supply it to other states as well”, said CM Khattar.

When we asked why they don’t improve power supply situation in other villages instead of reducing power supply in Gurugram, Mr. Khattar said, “Our villagers are very hard working people. It is mostly because they don’t sit around TV or Laptop wasting their time like the urban people. Now if we start providing them 24 hrs power, they will also become lazy. Then how will we feed our population of 125 Crores?”

Faking News tried to speak to some of the residents of Gurugram who were very upset with the power situation. “During the day it is fine. I go to a Multiplex to watch a film or spend time in Metro where there is always air-conditioning. Problem begins at night when there is no power and I can’t go out also. At least give us power then. Din me basa lo apna gram”, said Vijay Beniwal, a resident of sector 46, Gurgaon.

However, CM Khattar dismissed the suggestion of providing uninterrupted power supply at night. “By cutting power at night, we are making sure that people sleep in the open under the beautiful view of starry skies. They should be thanking us for this service”, said the CM before going to sit in his AC car as there was no power in his office.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/and-cousin-business-is.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/daily-power-cuts-part-of-gurgaon-citys-rebranding-as-gurugram-ml-khattar-9937,Daily power cuts part of Gurgaon city's rebranding as Gurugram- ML Khattar,,1464598664.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The government is contemplating this to stop Sidhu from unleashing his commentary on the suffering nation (The real one, India not Arnab Goswami).

Rare photo of Sidhu with his mouth closed

As per Faking News sources in PMO, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah heard Sidhu’s commentary during the last match featuring Gujarat Lions and immediately decided that they must protect Indian ears from this assault.

“They spent best part of an hour trying to link what Sidhu was saying to what was happening on the field but failed to do so. Sidhu talked about sugarcanes, hell, heaven, airplane, Bollywood, Delhi, Punjab, capitalism, socialism but didn’t say one line on the actual action happening. Both Modi and Shah sat in stunned silence for a while before changing the channel to listen to Danny Morrison’s commentary. That is when they decided that they have to get Sidhu out of the commentators’ box”, said our source.

“They made him Rajya Sabha MP so that he gets less time for commentary but forgot that Rajya Sabha MPs have little work to do anyway. Now they have decided to give him a place in Modi cabinet during the next reshuffle to keep him engaged. After that, we can tell cricket watching public that ache din have arrived”, the source added.

Even though almost everyone, including the drummer in extra innings t20, is welcoming the move, the members of the Modi govt and the opposition are terrorized. One was quoted as saying, “If Sidhu becomes a cabinet minister then we can’t ask any question related to that ministry. Sihu will start answering the question and we will have to listen to that!”

Tim Cook assuring an AIADMK supporter that he will meet Amma during his next visit

The AIADMK supporters are threatening boycott of all Apple products including even the apple fruit as a response to Tim Cook’s gross negligence. They are also planning to change the content in Tamil Nadu textbooks which would state that an orange fell on Newton’s head that made him think about gravity.

Speaking to Faking News, a senior party member of AIADMK said, “Now first of all many congratulations to Amma on her fantastic victory. Now coming to the matter of Tim Cook, we are very disappointed with him. He has been touring the whole country visiting almost everything in his way but he couldn’t find the time to come and visit Amma to bow down to her like all respectable people!”

“He had time to watch an IPL match, who watches IPL after CSK’s suspension? He could have easily visited Chennai on that day, touched Amma’s feet for a second and then be gone. We would have normally excused him had he not been in India, like we have excused Donald Trump or Obama or King Tommen and Cersei Lannister for not visiting Amma but he was right here. This is really offensive to us”, said the leader.

Meanwhile, supporters of AIADMK across Tamil Nadu were seen burning Apple fruit to register their protest against Tim Cook.

Apple shareholders have taken note of this protest and have asked Tim Cook to replace Apple logo with Jayalalitha’s face for the products to be shipped to Tamil Nadu. “We sent him to India to increase our sales and he closed down a major market for us?

While members of all parties figuratively bow down before high command, at AIADMK they do it literally and it is starting to take its toll.

Due to the pain in the back, now they need assistance to bend down

After AIADMK’s victory in Tamil Nadu assembly polls, every leader once again rushed to bow down before Jayalalitha. After this, many of them rushed to see a doctor to address the pain in their backs.

“Well they have been coming to me for a while to address the pain in their back but yesterday, almost hundreds of AIADMK workers came at once. That is when I found out that AIADMK has won the elections and Amma will be Chief Minister again”, a senior doctor who regularly treats AIADMK workers said.

“I advised them to avoid bending down repeatedly but they told me that if they don’t bend down, their political careers will so that is not an option. We are trying various methods to reduce their pain and also make their backs more resilient against repeated bending. Hopefully, in coming days they will be able to bend without any pain”, the doctor said.

When we tried to get in touch with some AIADMK leaders, we found them deep in a strategic meeting. After the meeting, when we asked what they were discussing, a leader said, “We are trying to remember who was the first AIADMK member to bow down to Amma and start this tradition. If we can find him, we will beat the hell out of him for giving us back problems.”

Meanwhile, leading spinner from Tamil Nadu, R. Ashwin has recommended the use of Moov to AIADMK leaders to reduce their pain but looking at the injury record of Rising Pune Supergiants, this idea didn’t find much takers.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ci4Rp0RVAAENKbN.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aiadmk-leaders-develop-back-ache-after-repeatedly-bowing-down-before-jayalalitha-9840,AIADMK leaders develop back ache after repeatedly bowing down before Jayalalitha,,1463729525.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bangladesh-demands-re-election-in-assam-after-bjps-win-says-they-didnt-get-to-vote-9838,"Dhaka: Stunned by the thumping victory of BJP in the Assam state elections, Bangladesh has today demanded that elections should be held again in the state.

These images shocked Bangladeshi people this morning

Though the statement hasn’t come directly from PM Sheikh Hasina, our sources have told us that she is in agreement with the demand.

A Bangladesh government spokesperson slammed Indian Election Commission for holding Assam and West Bengal elections so close to one another. “We just checked today’s newspapers and found out that BJP has formed government in Assam. A lot of our people thought they were only allowed one vote and ended up voting in West Bengal and missed out on voting in Assam. This is against the spirit of democracy. In fact, we want to put it on record that this is the murder of democracy,” he cried.

BJP leaders have already hinted that they will come down hard on the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam. CM elect Sarbananda Sonowal has already said that his first priority will be to cancel voter ids of illegal immigrants and sealing India-Bangladesh border. This statement hasn’t gone down well in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh Exports Minister Gaffar Khan came down hard on Rahul Gandhi for the poor performance in the state they held for so long. “We were assured by Congress and AUDF that they will comfortably beat BJP in Assam, therefore we didn’t focus on Assam and concentrated on Bengal elections. Now this BJP victory has come as a huge shock to us. BJP will only encourage xenophobia against Bangladesh and badly affect our export of Bangladeshis to India. We never trusted Congress that much but now we suspect even AUDF is hand in glove with the BJP”, he thundered.

When we asked the esteemed minister what actions will they take if Election Commission of India didn’t accept their demand, he said,”India will see strong reaction if they don’t agree to our demands. We will recall all the maids working in the Indian capital Delhi and then we will see how they manage without them.”

On being asked whether there is anything else India can do if they are unable to hold re-elections, the minister said, “Well, they can always accept that THAT was not a no ball.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/462152-sarbanand-sonowal-pti-assam-polls.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bangladesh-demands-re-election-in-assam-after-bjps-win-says-they-didnt-get-to-vote-9838,"Bangladesh demands re-election in Assam after BJP's win, says they didn’t get to vote",,1463723337.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

He also announced that his son and designated successor, MK Stalin, will continue as the leader of DMK youth wing will continue to be a youth leader till then.

I am going to be the CM again!

This was widely expected to be the last election of Mr. Karunanidhi who turns 92 on 3rd of June. His designated successor and DMK youth leader Stalin is only 63.

These announcements were made by Mr. Karunanidhi after losing the 2016 assembly elections to Jayalaitha led AIADMK in a keenly contest battle. Kalaignar, as he is affectionately called, has served as Tamil Nadu CM on 5 precious occasions and he dearly wants to become CM one more time.

“I was hoping to become the Chief Minister this time as it was my turn. Tamil Nadu voters always elect AIADMK and DMK alternatively but it seems some of them got confused this time and ended up voting for AIADMK once again. However, I am sure that next time they will return to their regular voting pattern and DMK will come to power with a thumping majority”, Mr. Karunanidhi said.

“I was hoping to let Stalin become the CM contender in 2021 after winning this year but we will have to delay his elevation. He has got time on his side; he is only 63 so he can continue to be the youth leader of DMK. After I leave the CM chair in 2026, he can start thinking about the CM post”, Mr. Karunanidhi added detailing his succession plan.

When we contacted AIADMK supremo Jayalitha for her comments on this development, she said, “I think we should celebrate 2021 victory today as well. Thank him on my behalf.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-govt-introduces-freebie-tax-to-fulfill-freebie-promises-9801,"Chennai: Political parties that announced freebies in a bid to lure voters are apparently in a quagmire now after news of most political parties unable to fulfill poll promises due to ‘funds crunch’ was reported in the media.

One tax to fund them all

An article in a local daily with the headline ‘There is no free lunjj’, threw light on how most political parties in TN, who promised a plethora of freebies, are now busy wondering how on earth are they going to fulfill it when they have no party funds.

Apparently the situation is so messed up that most parties have set aside their differences and agreed to join hands to deal with the situation. “I have not seen such camaraderie ever in my entire political career. Even during floods ruling and opposition were involved in blame game. But looks like they have found a common enemy now. Like Lalu-Nitish coming together to defeat Modi,” said a source from DMK who didn’t wish to be named.

An all party meeting that saw attendance of the top cadre of every political party, was conducted at a secret venue. Sources say that the discussion focused on how parties could contribute to the ‘freebie fund’ and tide over the situation. A few ideas suggested by members were ‘money from Amma pictures’, ‘Captain Vijaykanth doing standup comedy’, ‘Karunanidhi as the brand ambassador for Rayban’ and so on.

“Yes, we did indeed discuss all these ideas in our meeting. But then we thought why should we work so hard. This election is not being fight on education, job or health but on which party gives more freebies. Who cares once the vote is cast,” said the source.

“The best way to deal with this would be to introduce a ‘Freebie tax’. A tax on the common man so that the Govt. can dole out freebies for votes. To do so they have to introduce 1% freebie tax or they have to cut 30% budget of both health and education sector. It will not only help us raise money, but also help us expand our freebie portfolio,” added our source with confidence.

With ‘freebie tax’ to fall back on, most parties have now introduced new items in their list. AIADMK has moved beyond mixer-grinder and is now giving VR headsets, with 360 deg. Videos of Amma’s rallies.

People of the state have already started to feel the pinch of the newly introduced tax. Many of them are left with a feeling of being cheated.

“I had gone to the restaurant with my family and was shocked to see ‘freebie tax’ on my bill. This restaurant owner is a cheat. His kitchen is filled with mixer-grinder and utensils given by Amma for free and now he is collecting tax from us. Adho paaru kaaka (A very intelligent way to trick people and make a fool of them),” screamed Sendhil Coomar Murdhee, a software engineer, clearly not happy with the tax.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/One-tax-to-fund-them-all.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-govt-introduces-freebie-tax-to-fulfill-freebie-promises-9801,Tamil Nadu Govt. introduces 'Freebie Tax' to fulfill freebie promises,,1463470726.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajya-sabha-to-introduce-swamy-hour-for-mps-to-outrage-and-fight-over-subramanian-swamys-comments-9794,"New Delhi: Fed up with Rajya Sabha MPs incessantly outraging over one or the other comment/act of the newest member of the house Subramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari has today announced the introduction of ‘Swamy Hour’ to Rajya Sabha’s proceedings.

1 hour to discuss me, full 1 hour

This ‘Swamy Hour’ will be part of the house proceedings from next session onwards.

This will precede the Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha and will begin at 10AM. The ‘Swamy Hour’ will exclusively be for the MPs to raise issues, slam tables, charge the well of the house or do whatever they want in reaction to Swamy’s comments or acts.

“This was the only solution. First the opposition MPs ran into the well of the house, then they got the house adjourned, then they wanted Privilege Motion against Swamy, then they wanted to even have Short Duration Discussion on even his comments on RBI Governor Rajan, tomorrow they will ask for discussion on his hairdye or his dogs. That’s when Deputy Chairman Kurien suggested this brilliant idea of Swamy Hour, “said a visibly exasperated Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari.

All comments/actions during ‘Swamy Hour’ will be deemed expunged, in line with most of Swamy’s comments in Rajya Sabha during his first few days getting expunged.

Industry experts say that the viewership ratings of Swamy Hour are expected to be off-the-charts. However, this isn’t expected to attract many children as Chairman Ansari strictly forbade any form of physical violence during the Swamy Hour.

When reached for a comment, Subramanian Swamy said, “They can have Swamy Hour if they want. I am not bothered. But what we really need is ‘Sonia Hour’ to discuss all the scams committed during UPA rule.” This immediately set the cat among the pigeons in Congress camp and they got into a huddle to strategize for the most severe attack on Swamy during the first Swamy Hour.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/subramanian-swamy-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajya-sabha-to-introduce-swamy-hour-for-mps-to-outrage-and-fight-over-subramanian-swamys-comments-9794,Rajya Sabha to introduce 'Swamy Hour' for MPs to outrage and fight over Subramanian Swamy's comments,,1463375827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/now-bjp-asks-kejriwal-to-solve-irodovs-problems-to-prove-he-cleared-jee-9773,"New Delhi: While the controversy over Narendra Modi’s degree was yet to die down, BJP has responded by raising questions over Arvind Kejriwal’s admission to IIT. Arvind Kejriwal was a student of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur from 1985 to 1989.

Solve it to prove you went to IIT

BJP has claimed that Arvind kejriwal entered IIT through some abnormal means and didn’t clear the Joint Entrance Exam required to get admission in IITs. Citing RTI response from IIT Kharagpur that showed Kejriwal’s JEE rank is unavailable, BJP has raised this question.

Speaking to the press, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Before he asks for degree of any of our leaders, he must prove that he did clear JEE and got a good enough rank to enter IIT. Everyone knows that nobody can enter IITs without being able to solve every problem in Irodov’s Physics book, Problems in General Physics. Let him come on camera and solve the problems we give him from the book and we will find out whether he did go to IIT.”

“We are not going to be too strict about it. We will give him 10 problems out of the book and he can solve any 5. That is enough to satisfy us. If he finds it too tough, we can give him maths questions to solve from the books by S.L. Loney and the book by Hall and Knight but in that case, he will have to solve 8 out of 10 questions. We are reasonable people”, Mr. patra added.

When we asked whether Mr. Patra can solve these questions, he replied, “Bhai irodov ke dar se main doctor ban gaya. Entire MBBS was easier than questions in that book. We will get some experts to evaluate.”

When we contacted Arvind Kejriwal for his response to this challenge, he said, “I am ready to take up this challenge provided center government gives control of the invigilator to Delhi Government. We suspect Modi Government will appoint their agent to deliberately fail me.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/centre-to-bring-in-a-mental-bankruptcy-bill-in-parliament-sources-9769,"New Delhi: Central Government has decided to bring in a Mental Bankruptcy Law to provide a framework for the quicker resolution of cases of shamelessness in public life. This bill would help in catching such offenders early, before they mount up the unfelt shame and bring them to book, making them pay for their shamelessness and relieving the society’s stress, sources said.

After introduction of mental bankruptcy bill, this will be a common sight.

This bill envisages setting up of a Shamelessness Index for individuals, making it a cognizable offence, making changes in Cr. PC for stringent actions for willful defaulters and launching a Guilt Restructuring Plan for genuine failures.

The Shamelessness Index would track the individual’s utterances, actions, self promotions and release a quarterly score of shamelessness called a SIBIL score. In case anyone’s SIBIL score falls below 50, on a scale of 100, he or she would be disallowed in public forums, media appearances, social media etc. Even the surrogate promotion by showing one’s back to camera, to circumvent the law, would not be allowed.

The changes in CrPC would allow for public slapping of individuals, hitting the individual with shoes, garlanding with slippers, tattooing ‘I am Shamed Person’ (मैं हूँ शर्मिंदा आदमी) on his or her forehead etc. There are plans that government may adopt a pay per hit scheme to garner revenues which can be used on setting up infrastructure like providing free wifi, setting up schools & hospitals, de-addiction centres etc. The enhanced sale of footwear would also boost the economy, sources said.

Guilt Restructuring Plan would be for those who accept the responsibility & implications of their shameful actions and are willing to make amends, ready to pay for it, but, over a period of time. They would be given options to redeem themselves like cleaning public places on odd days and promoting nationalism in JNU on even days. The restructuring plans would be flexible with exemptions like parole based on good behavior during the restructuring period.

Faking News reporter met a social scientist, Mr. Pralap Pani Behta to for better understanding of this issue. He agreed for the half an hour interview during the time he would be in his bathtub.

“The failures in public life can be caused by many reasons; a character defining tendency of shirking work, a predisposition to blame other people all the time, penchant to be visible on media around the clock or thwarted political ambitions, defined as cases of mental bankruptcy. Other reasons could also be a dynastic imbecility, a thorough incapability to understand the complications of public life or imperialistic belief of being the lord of everything, defined as intellectual bankruptcy. Both are treated at par.”Mr. Behta explained, while soaping his back.

“In all such cases, failed individual is required to pay for the failure by feeling the guilt & shame associated with or arising out of his or her actions but does not do so as he or she feels that all the people can be fooled all the time. Also, absence of a credible societal mechanism causes delays in identifying the mental or intellectual bankruptcy of the individual early.” Said Mr Behta, stopping to turn the tap to full flow.

“This unfelt guilt, a kind of unpaid debt, mounts up as Non Felt Shame (NFS), affecting the mental health of the society and putting an additional burden on other, healthy individuals who now have to feel the additional quota of guilt, unfelt by these individuals. Just like the farmers in Maharashtra are facing the water shortage due to our bad habits of wasting water in our religious practices of offering water to Sun.” Continued Mr. Behta, as we moved slightly away from bathtub as it was overflowing now.

“This law would enable the society to identify the failed individuals before they mount up the guilt to higher proportions and make them pay for it.”

“This, in my view, is the biggest social reform, undertaken by any society, anywhere in the world, anytime.”Concluded Mr. Behta, draining out the bathtub.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/y1B6TKmb.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/centre-to-bring-in-a-mental-bankruptcy-bill-in-parliament-sources-9769,Centre to bring in a Mental Bankruptcy bill in Parliament: Sources,,1463050614.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The elections for the Tamil Nadu assembly are scheduled to be held on the 16th of this month.

All of them should become CM

The man, identified as Mr. Ganeshan, is a first time voter having turned 18 last year. Leading political parties across Tamil Nadu have offered plenty of freebies and subsidies to attract voters and Ganeshan wants to get hold of all the freebies offered.

“I am a responsible citizen and want to exercise my right to vote. However, I do not like the present politics and the politicians in the state, you see! So, I decided to vote for NOTA to express my pain to the EC and aversion towards hopeless democracy in our state. But then, I read the manifestos of all the political parties and saw the freebies all of them are offering. If I can get all that then I am set to start my new life as an adult”, Said Ganeshan.

Furthermore he said, “There is free laptop, free wifi, free rice, free Gold, free power, free water, cheap home loans, free clothes, free cow, free goat, free fans, free kitchen appliances, everything is free. We just have to find a way to ensure everyone is elected so that we don’t lose out on any freebies and AOTA is the best way to do it.”

“It is not just the freebies that will come after the elections; I have already taken money from every party’s campaign team to vote for them. Now I am an honest man and I don’t want to cheat anyone. Unlike a politician, we have to keep our promises so election commission should add that AOTA button to get me out of my current predicament”, Ganeshan added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-comparing-kerala-to-somalia-modi-offends-keralites-by-saying-singapore-is-better-than-dubai-9757,"Kochi: A day after raising a political storm by saying that infant mortality rate among STs in Kerala was worse than Somalia, Indian PM Narendra Modi has offended many Keralites again by saying that Singapore is better than Dubai.

Dubai district of Kerala

Speaking at a political rally in the state, PM Modi remarked that Keralites keep heading towards Dubai when Singapore is a much better option. Modi went a step ahead and asked Keralites to learn from Tamils who prefer Singapore to Dubai.

There are nearly 3 Million Keralites in the Gulf with the largest number of them living in Dubai. As per experts, Modi may have ended BJP’s hopes in Kerala by implying that some other city is better than Dubai.

During his speech, Narendra Modi mentioned that Singapore has a better airport, better buildings, better planning, has greater social equality and is generally cleaner than Dubai. These comments haven’t gone down well with the Keralites who have long considered Dubai a holy place.

“First he says infant mortality rate in Kerala is higher than Somalia, which was ok, who knows it could be true. But then he said that our Dubai isn’t the best city in the world and then he asks us to learn from Tamil people? Why is he hell bent on offending us?” asked an irate Ratheesh, a resident of Kochi.

Another local resident Lijo John joined in and told this Faking News reporter, “What is Modi even talking about? Look at Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Atlantis, Palm Jumeirah, how can Singapore match all these things? Malayalis have built Dubai through their sweat and blood and you can’t come here and start saying that some other city is better. Not if you want to win an election.”

“Since he doesn’t understand Malayalam, let me tell him in Hindi. Modi Ji, Singapore zindabad hoga usse humein koi aitraaz nahin lekin hamara Dubai Zindabad tha, Zindabad hai aur Zindabad rahega!” Lijo added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-congress-and-aap-start-their-own-universities-to-ensure-every-leader-has-a-degree-9751,"New Delhi: After the recent controversy over Narendra Modi’s degrees, political parties in India have decided to start their very own Universities to ensure that every leader has a degree that is easily verifiable. BJP, Congress and AAP have already opened their universities and other parties are expected to follow suit. In an exclusive, Faking News managed to get details of these Universities.

The VCs of these Universities

BJP University: This is the only university which is jack of all trades, but master of none. It has a couple of hardworking alumnus, who don’t know how to communicate. The top management of the university is always at loggerheads with the middle management. However, it has assorted specialisations. Professor Gadkari teaches organic farming, without wasting any water. Diplomacy skills of Sakshi Maharaj and Adityanath are world famous. If there is anyone in the world who understands importance of social media, it is Professor Shah. Arun Jaitley, who is known to be more favourite with the opposition camp, can be called the modern day Dale Carnegie. Admission Criteria: 25000+ followers on twitter. Noted Professors:

Narendra Modi: World geography Nitin Gadkari :- Organic farming Sakshi Maharaj and Yogi Adityanath:- Political correctness and creative writing Amit Shah :- Social Media management Arun Jaitley :- Diplomacy and HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE

Congress University: – This University can put any big B-school to shame, only university in India that teaches students how to make money quickly. Entrepreneur Robert Vadra is not only a noted alumnus of this university but also a guest lecturer here. He can teach students a thing or two about property management and farming. If you can’t learn the art of making money from this university, most probably you can’t learn it anywhere. Admission criteria: Naming everyone in Nehru-Gandhi family tree correctly. Noted Professors: Rahul Gandhi: – Professor of long term strategy Sonia Gandhi: – Hindi language and diction Robert Vadra :- Guest lecturer on farming and property management Abhishek Manu Singhvi :- Audio Visual Communications Manmohan Singh: – Oratory and the art of silent communication Chidambaram: – Accounting and financial (mis)management

AAP University: This University specialises in mass communication, activism and advertising. It might be better than most C-schools (communication schools please don’t misunderstand). AAP’s personal Wren and Martin THE ASHUTOSH will teach English at the university, making it the best place to learn the language. Professor Kejriwal’s expertise in advertising can put world’s best media planners to shame. Somnath Bharti’s work in the field of women empowerment is well known; hence his lecturers on women’s rights will be enlightening for students. University also has guest lectures by Vishal Dadlani, Vishal will teach students how to be a part time activist while trying to manage full time work. Admission Criteria: Ability to blame Modi maximum times during the interview Noted Professors: THE ASHUTOSH: Professor for English and Communication Shri Kejriwal: Dharna Management , activism, and use of Social Media, advertising and mass communication Somnath Bharti: Women’s rights Vishal Dadlani: Guest lecturer on how to manage activism along with a full-time job.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1312605_Wallpaper1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-congress-and-aap-start-their-own-universities-to-ensure-every-leader-has-a-degree-9751,"BJP, Congress and AAP start their own universities to ensure every leader has a degree",,1462861161.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-politicians-admit-that-they-have-run-out-of-free-things-they-can-promise-to-voters-9747,"Chennai: With a week remaining for the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, the politicians are really worried these days. The reason behind their concern is that they have run of free stuff they can promise to voters and are no longer sure what to say over the next week.

What else can they promise the voters

“There is absolutely nothing else we can promise them. We have already covered free mixer, free grinder, free gold, free electricity, free water, free goat, free cow, free laptop, free wifi, free fan, free food and free clothes, what is left? We can’t just tell the voters that this is all we have to offer and now wait for the polling day. We must keep on promising them more free stuff”, said a senior leader of a political party on the condition of anonymity.

When we asked whether they are effectively buying votes by promising all these freebies, the concerned leader got offended and said, “No, not at all. This is knowledgeable Chennai crowd; they can’t be swayed by freebies. In fact, we aren’t giving anything free to them. This is the reward they deserve for coming to the polling booth on the day of the election and saving democracy through their vote.”

As per sources, all the major parties in Tamil Nadu are going to meet at a secret location to come up with a list of things they can still promise for free to the voters. While some have proposed free tickets to Kabali, others have mentioned free trip to Singapore for every Tamil. Free tickets to all matches involving CSK was also proposed but later dropped when they were reminded that CSK is currently serving its suspension.

Meanwhile, AIADMK politicians have also expressed concern that they are running out of places to put Jayalalitha’s posters. “We will hire small airplanes to display Amma’s banners in the sky as there is no space left on the ground”, said a senior party functionary.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tamil-nadu-polls-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-politicians-admit-that-they-have-run-out-of-free-things-they-can-promise-to-voters-9747,Tamil Nadu politicians admit that they have run out of free things they can promise to voters,,1462787773.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/big-mncs-approach-kejriwal-for-degree-verification-and-background-checks-of-new-hires-9739,"Mumbai: Several major MNCs operating in India have approached Delhi CM Mr. Arvind Kejriwal to provide his services for background checks and degree verification of potential recruits.

This has happened after Kejriwal took up the initiative to verify educational credentials of PM of India Narendra Modi and created a stir in media by stating that PM Modi degree is fake without even looking at it. Even FBI sleuths struggle to verify documents at this speed and Kejriwal’s reputation has grown by leaps and bounds after this.

Kejriwal checking Modi’s degree

Not just educational qualifications, MNCs are looking at Mr. Kejriwal to provide character certificates of the applicants as well. Earlier, he used to inform Indians who is corrupt and who is not just by looking at the face of the person. Corrupt politicians still takes solace in the fact that Kejriwal never called them corrupt although legal courts of India have declared them corrupt based on the available evidence. Now it seems verifying documents and degrees is Kejriwal’s latest venture.

Anita Rai, HR head of a leading software firm which has asked for Kejriwal’s services, is optimistic that Kejriwal will come on board to assist them. “We hire thousands every year and we are not sure who has a real degree and experience letter. Once our newly hired CEO was later found out to be just 10th pass. We need people such as Kejriwal who are passionate about degrees.”

Ashutosh, who left all important work and went to Delhi University to find PM Bachelor’s degree, spoke to us over phone and said, “Sometimes Arvind Ji is unable to tell by looking at someone’s face if degree is genuine or not so we have to go to the University to check. Very soon I will be heading to Yale as well to look for Smriti Irani’s degree.”

When Ashutosh was asked why they didn’t check Jitender Tomar’s degree with such diligence, he disconnected the phone.

It is still not clear whether Kejriwal will be able to provide his services to these firms considering his busy schedule of tweeting about PM, watching new movies, protesting at Jantar-Mantar, holding Press conferences and eulogizing AAP government in Delhi on FM Radio.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BA-Pass-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/big-mncs-approach-kejriwal-for-degree-verification-and-background-checks-of-new-hires-9739,Big MNCs approach Kejriwal for degree verification and background checks of new hires,,1462695061.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/65-african-researchers-write-to-kanhaiya-kumar-to-do-a-tour-of-africa-for-his-phd-in-african-studies-9734,"Nairobi: 65 African researchers have written a letter to AISF student leader and ‘darling of media’ Kanhaiya Kumar.

What is the use of doing a PhD in African studies, when you are roaming across India and not Africa?” wondered an African researcher who is one of the 65 signatories

In that letter, they have requested the emerging leader Kanhaiya to do a tour of Africa, which can help in having a deeper understanding of his African studies. They have also revealed that Africa has more poor people than India and has even attached a few photos to show how Africa is suffering from poverty.

After going through the letter, we tried to contact a few of the signatories. Ablablabla Rabler, one such Researcher from the University of Nairobi, was humble enough to respond to us via a phone call.

When asked about the reason for sending a letter to the ‘messiah of media’, Ablablabla said, “Look! When we were trying to find out the ways to bring Africa out of poverty, we tried to look into all possible theories on economics and how to make sure that money reaches to the bottom. All our economic experiments met their dead-end. It was at this time, we read in online news websites from India that there is a new guy called Kanhaiya who has vowed to get poor people to be free from poverty. We listened to his speeches and were convinced that he is the guy we are looking for.”

“Not only his speeches, he also claimed that he is from a poor family and is living on stipends. But he is having an iPhone and travels in business class in flights. Even, well paid researchers like me cannot do it. So, if a poor in India has got access to this much luxury, Kanhaiya can definitely repeat the magic in Africa,” said Ablablabla who has done a PhD in African Economics.

“It is like a ‘one stone-two oranges’ for him too. Not only we will be benefited by his revolutionary ideas, he can also spend his time to work on his PhD thesis. If I’m right, he is doing his PhD in African studies and it will be good if he could visit Africa at least once, which can help him get more ideas for his research,” said Mobango from Harare, who claims that he also has a PhD.

When asked whether they would meet and invite Kanhaiya in person, his voice grew shrill, “We would have flown down to India, but he is in Delhi and we will be forced to urinate on roads there by their Common Man Party. So, we are scared to go there.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kanhaiya.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/65-african-researchers-write-to-kanhaiya-kumar-to-do-a-tour-of-africa-for-his-phd-in-african-studies-9734,65 African researchers write to Kanhaiya Kumar to do a tour of Africa for his PhD in African Studies,,1462593617.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-slams-sonia-gandhi-for-getting-caught-up-in-scams-asks-her-to-come-clean-9659,"New Delhi. Country’s favorite Son-in-law Robert Vadra today stunned the Congress party and the whole nation by slamming Sonia Gandhi for getting caught up in scams.

Faking News has learnt that Vadra was very upset after seeing the name of “Signora Gandhi” figuring in the Italian court judgment on AgustaWestland bribery case. He was particularly upset after seeing “fam” in handwritten note with list of those who were paid kickbacks.

Vadra is not ready to listen

“This is very unprofessional on the part of Mrs. Gandhi. How can she allow the family’s name to appear in the bribery scandal? It hurts the image of honest farmers like me who are part of the family,” thundered Mr. Vadra.

The statement has shocked entire India as Vadra was not expected to name Sonia Gandhi. “I had still not recovered from the shock of Arvind Kejriwal mentioning Sonia Gandhi’s name, and now this! May god give me strength,” a political observer said.

Vadra, who of late has been commenting on many issues, especially those of corruption, is rumored to be eyeing the space vacated by Arvind Kejriwal, who once used to be an anti-corruption crusader before he joined Twitter and subsequently politics.

Vadra had only recently said that he was willing to join politics and serve people if that’s what people wanted.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-asks-center-to-run-vayudoot-trains-for-bringing-fresh-air-from-other-states-to-delhi-9653,"New Delhi. In a scathing attack against the Center and the Prime Minister, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded Modi to work with other states and make them send “Vayudoot” trains to Delhi i.e. trains carrying fresh air from scenic parts of the country, in order to fight the state’s pollution which seems unaffected by the odd-even rule.

Kejriwal started with a question as he spoke to Faking News. “When Modi can send water to the drought-affected areas, why can’t he send fresh air from serene places like Uttarakhand, Ooty and Kodaikanal?” he asked the PM in what seemed like a direct attack on him.

“Look at these people breathing fresh air, can’t they help Delhi people?”

“Those trains can directly run around Delhi and pump fresh air in the atmosphere, and thereby, sustain Delhi’s biosphere,” said Kejriwal as he continued to explain the reason behind his suggestion.

The demand by the AAP supremo and Delhi CM is reported to be inspired by Jaldoot trains run by the center, which ferries water to drought hit areas.

Neutral experts say that the demand is not absurd and the center should think about it.

“Don’t we have oxygen cylinders?” a neutral expert cum independent commentator explained, “The idea of carrying air for breathing where it is in scarcity is perfectly scientific, and so is the idea to have Vayudoot trains. Delhi is not too far away from places like Shimla and Nainital, which are well connected with railways, so execution shouldn’t be a problem.”

Delhi CM praised the independent commentator and re-tweeted the neutral expert before revealing that the massive ads given by the Delhi government were actually a part of this plan to demand Vayudoot trains.

“Our ads about odd-even have been aired on national television channels and we have even given print ads in local newspapers of many states. Now all these states know our problem. They must come together and help us. If they don’t do it, we’ve to conclude that woh sab mile huye hain,” Kejriwal said, appealing for help.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kejriwal-pointing.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-asks-center-to-run-vayudoot-trains-for-bringing-fresh-air-from-other-states-to-delhi-9653,"Kejriwal asks Center to run ""Vayudoot"" trains for bringing fresh air from other states to Delhi",,1461832640.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-govt-introduces-freebie-tax-to-fulfill-freebie-promises-9801,"Chennai: Political parties that announced freebies in a bid to lure voters are apparently in a quagmire now after news of most political parties unable to fulfill poll promises due to ‘funds crunch’ was reported in the media.

One tax to fund them all

An article in a local daily with the headline ‘There is no free lunjj’, threw light on how most political parties in TN, who promised a plethora of freebies, are now busy wondering how on earth are they going to fulfill it when they have no party funds.

Apparently the situation is so messed up that most parties have set aside their differences and agreed to join hands to deal with the situation. “I have not seen such camaraderie ever in my entire political career. Even during floods ruling and opposition were involved in blame game. But looks like they have found a common enemy now. Like Lalu-Nitish coming together to defeat Modi,” said a source from DMK who didn’t wish to be named.

An all party meeting that saw attendance of the top cadre of every political party, was conducted at a secret venue. Sources say that the discussion focused on how parties could contribute to the ‘freebie fund’ and tide over the situation. A few ideas suggested by members were ‘money from Amma pictures’, ‘Captain Vijaykanth doing standup comedy’, ‘Karunanidhi as the brand ambassador for Rayban’ and so on.

“Yes, we did indeed discuss all these ideas in our meeting. But then we thought why should we work so hard. This election is not being fight on education, job or health but on which party gives more freebies. Who cares once the vote is cast,” said the source.

“The best way to deal with this would be to introduce a ‘Freebie tax’. A tax on the common man so that the Govt. can dole out freebies for votes. To do so they have to introduce 1% freebie tax or they have to cut 30% budget of both health and education sector. It will not only help us raise money, but also help us expand our freebie portfolio,” added our source with confidence.

With ‘freebie tax’ to fall back on, most parties have now introduced new items in their list. AIADMK has moved beyond mixer-grinder and is now giving VR headsets, with 360 deg. Videos of Amma’s rallies.

People of the state have already started to feel the pinch of the newly introduced tax. Many of them are left with a feeling of being cheated.

“I had gone to the restaurant with my family and was shocked to see ‘freebie tax’ on my bill. This restaurant owner is a cheat. His kitchen is filled with mixer-grinder and utensils given by Amma for free and now he is collecting tax from us. Adho paaru kaaka (A very intelligent way to trick people and make a fool of them),” screamed Sendhil Coomar Murdhee, a software engineer, clearly not happy with the tax.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/One-tax-to-fund-them-all.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-govt-introduces-freebie-tax-to-fulfill-freebie-promises-9801,Tamil Nadu Govt. introduces 'Freebie Tax' to fulfill freebie promises,,1463470726.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajya-sabha-to-introduce-swamy-hour-for-mps-to-outrage-and-fight-over-subramanian-swamys-comments-9794,"New Delhi: Fed up with Rajya Sabha MPs incessantly outraging over one or the other comment/act of the newest member of the house Subramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari has today announced the introduction of ‘Swamy Hour’ to Rajya Sabha’s proceedings.

1 hour to discuss me, full 1 hour

This ‘Swamy Hour’ will be part of the house proceedings from next session onwards.

This will precede the Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha and will begin at 10AM. The ‘Swamy Hour’ will exclusively be for the MPs to raise issues, slam tables, charge the well of the house or do whatever they want in reaction to Swamy’s comments or acts.

“This was the only solution. First the opposition MPs ran into the well of the house, then they got the house adjourned, then they wanted Privilege Motion against Swamy, then they wanted to even have Short Duration Discussion on even his comments on RBI Governor Rajan, tomorrow they will ask for discussion on his hairdye or his dogs. That’s when Deputy Chairman Kurien suggested this brilliant idea of Swamy Hour, “said a visibly exasperated Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari.

All comments/actions during ‘Swamy Hour’ will be deemed expunged, in line with most of Swamy’s comments in Rajya Sabha during his first few days getting expunged.

Industry experts say that the viewership ratings of Swamy Hour are expected to be off-the-charts. However, this isn’t expected to attract many children as Chairman Ansari strictly forbade any form of physical violence during the Swamy Hour.

When reached for a comment, Subramanian Swamy said, “They can have Swamy Hour if they want. I am not bothered. But what we really need is ‘Sonia Hour’ to discuss all the scams committed during UPA rule.” This immediately set the cat among the pigeons in Congress camp and they got into a huddle to strategize for the most severe attack on Swamy during the first Swamy Hour.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/subramanian-swamy-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajya-sabha-to-introduce-swamy-hour-for-mps-to-outrage-and-fight-over-subramanian-swamys-comments-9794,Rajya Sabha to introduce 'Swamy Hour' for MPs to outrage and fight over Subramanian Swamy's comments,,1463375827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/now-bjp-asks-kejriwal-to-solve-irodovs-problems-to-prove-he-cleared-jee-9773,"New Delhi: While the controversy over Narendra Modi’s degree was yet to die down, BJP has responded by raising questions over Arvind Kejriwal’s admission to IIT. Arvind Kejriwal was a student of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur from 1985 to 1989.

Solve it to prove you went to IIT

BJP has claimed that Arvind kejriwal entered IIT through some abnormal means and didn’t clear the Joint Entrance Exam required to get admission in IITs. Citing RTI response from IIT Kharagpur that showed Kejriwal’s JEE rank is unavailable, BJP has raised this question.

Speaking to the press, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Before he asks for degree of any of our leaders, he must prove that he did clear JEE and got a good enough rank to enter IIT. Everyone knows that nobody can enter IITs without being able to solve every problem in Irodov’s Physics book, Problems in General Physics. Let him come on camera and solve the problems we give him from the book and we will find out whether he did go to IIT.”

“We are not going to be too strict about it. We will give him 10 problems out of the book and he can solve any 5. That is enough to satisfy us. If he finds it too tough, we can give him maths questions to solve from the books by S.L. Loney and the book by Hall and Knight but in that case, he will have to solve 8 out of 10 questions. We are reasonable people”, Mr. patra added.

When we asked whether Mr. Patra can solve these questions, he replied, “Bhai irodov ke dar se main doctor ban gaya. Entire MBBS was easier than questions in that book. We will get some experts to evaluate.”

When we contacted Arvind Kejriwal for his response to this challenge, he said, “I am ready to take up this challenge provided center government gives control of the invigilator to Delhi Government. We suspect Modi Government will appoint their agent to deliberately fail me.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/centre-to-bring-in-a-mental-bankruptcy-bill-in-parliament-sources-9769,"New Delhi: Central Government has decided to bring in a Mental Bankruptcy Law to provide a framework for the quicker resolution of cases of shamelessness in public life. This bill would help in catching such offenders early, before they mount up the unfelt shame and bring them to book, making them pay for their shamelessness and relieving the society’s stress, sources said.

After introduction of mental bankruptcy bill, this will be a common sight.

This bill envisages setting up of a Shamelessness Index for individuals, making it a cognizable offence, making changes in Cr. PC for stringent actions for willful defaulters and launching a Guilt Restructuring Plan for genuine failures.

The Shamelessness Index would track the individual’s utterances, actions, self promotions and release a quarterly score of shamelessness called a SIBIL score. In case anyone’s SIBIL score falls below 50, on a scale of 100, he or she would be disallowed in public forums, media appearances, social media etc. Even the surrogate promotion by showing one’s back to camera, to circumvent the law, would not be allowed.

The changes in CrPC would allow for public slapping of individuals, hitting the individual with shoes, garlanding with slippers, tattooing ‘I am Shamed Person’ (मैं हूँ शर्मिंदा आदमी) on his or her forehead etc. There are plans that government may adopt a pay per hit scheme to garner revenues which can be used on setting up infrastructure like providing free wifi, setting up schools & hospitals, de-addiction centres etc. The enhanced sale of footwear would also boost the economy, sources said.

Guilt Restructuring Plan would be for those who accept the responsibility & implications of their shameful actions and are willing to make amends, ready to pay for it, but, over a period of time. They would be given options to redeem themselves like cleaning public places on odd days and promoting nationalism in JNU on even days. The restructuring plans would be flexible with exemptions like parole based on good behavior during the restructuring period.

Faking News reporter met a social scientist, Mr. Pralap Pani Behta to for better understanding of this issue. He agreed for the half an hour interview during the time he would be in his bathtub.

“The failures in public life can be caused by many reasons; a character defining tendency of shirking work, a predisposition to blame other people all the time, penchant to be visible on media around the clock or thwarted political ambitions, defined as cases of mental bankruptcy. Other reasons could also be a dynastic imbecility, a thorough incapability to understand the complications of public life or imperialistic belief of being the lord of everything, defined as intellectual bankruptcy. Both are treated at par.”Mr. Behta explained, while soaping his back.

“In all such cases, failed individual is required to pay for the failure by feeling the guilt & shame associated with or arising out of his or her actions but does not do so as he or she feels that all the people can be fooled all the time. Also, absence of a credible societal mechanism causes delays in identifying the mental or intellectual bankruptcy of the individual early.” Said Mr Behta, stopping to turn the tap to full flow.

“This unfelt guilt, a kind of unpaid debt, mounts up as Non Felt Shame (NFS), affecting the mental health of the society and putting an additional burden on other, healthy individuals who now have to feel the additional quota of guilt, unfelt by these individuals. Just like the farmers in Maharashtra are facing the water shortage due to our bad habits of wasting water in our religious practices of offering water to Sun.” Continued Mr. Behta, as we moved slightly away from bathtub as it was overflowing now.

“This law would enable the society to identify the failed individuals before they mount up the guilt to higher proportions and make them pay for it.”

“This, in my view, is the biggest social reform, undertaken by any society, anywhere in the world, anytime.”Concluded Mr. Behta, draining out the bathtub.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/y1B6TKmb.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/centre-to-bring-in-a-mental-bankruptcy-bill-in-parliament-sources-9769,Centre to bring in a Mental Bankruptcy bill in Parliament: Sources,,1463050614.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The elections for the Tamil Nadu assembly are scheduled to be held on the 16th of this month.

All of them should become CM

The man, identified as Mr. Ganeshan, is a first time voter having turned 18 last year. Leading political parties across Tamil Nadu have offered plenty of freebies and subsidies to attract voters and Ganeshan wants to get hold of all the freebies offered.

“I am a responsible citizen and want to exercise my right to vote. However, I do not like the present politics and the politicians in the state, you see! So, I decided to vote for NOTA to express my pain to the EC and aversion towards hopeless democracy in our state. But then, I read the manifestos of all the political parties and saw the freebies all of them are offering. If I can get all that then I am set to start my new life as an adult”, Said Ganeshan.

Furthermore he said, “There is free laptop, free wifi, free rice, free Gold, free power, free water, cheap home loans, free clothes, free cow, free goat, free fans, free kitchen appliances, everything is free. We just have to find a way to ensure everyone is elected so that we don’t lose out on any freebies and AOTA is the best way to do it.”

“It is not just the freebies that will come after the elections; I have already taken money from every party’s campaign team to vote for them. Now I am an honest man and I don’t want to cheat anyone. Unlike a politician, we have to keep our promises so election commission should add that AOTA button to get me out of my current predicament”, Ganeshan added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-comparing-kerala-to-somalia-modi-offends-keralites-by-saying-singapore-is-better-than-dubai-9757,"Kochi: A day after raising a political storm by saying that infant mortality rate among STs in Kerala was worse than Somalia, Indian PM Narendra Modi has offended many Keralites again by saying that Singapore is better than Dubai.

Dubai district of Kerala

Speaking at a political rally in the state, PM Modi remarked that Keralites keep heading towards Dubai when Singapore is a much better option. Modi went a step ahead and asked Keralites to learn from Tamils who prefer Singapore to Dubai.

There are nearly 3 Million Keralites in the Gulf with the largest number of them living in Dubai. As per experts, Modi may have ended BJP’s hopes in Kerala by implying that some other city is better than Dubai.

During his speech, Narendra Modi mentioned that Singapore has a better airport, better buildings, better planning, has greater social equality and is generally cleaner than Dubai. These comments haven’t gone down well with the Keralites who have long considered Dubai a holy place.

“First he says infant mortality rate in Kerala is higher than Somalia, which was ok, who knows it could be true. But then he said that our Dubai isn’t the best city in the world and then he asks us to learn from Tamil people? Why is he hell bent on offending us?” asked an irate Ratheesh, a resident of Kochi.

Another local resident Lijo John joined in and told this Faking News reporter, “What is Modi even talking about? Look at Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Atlantis, Palm Jumeirah, how can Singapore match all these things? Malayalis have built Dubai through their sweat and blood and you can’t come here and start saying that some other city is better. Not if you want to win an election.”

“Since he doesn’t understand Malayalam, let me tell him in Hindi. Modi Ji, Singapore zindabad hoga usse humein koi aitraaz nahin lekin hamara Dubai Zindabad tha, Zindabad hai aur Zindabad rahega!” Lijo added.

BJP, Congress and AAP have already opened their universities and other parties are expected to follow suit. In an exclusive, Faking News managed to get details of these Universities.

The VCs of these Universities

BJP University: This is the only university which is jack of all trades, but master of none. It has a couple of hardworking alumnus, who don’t know how to communicate. The top management of the university is always at loggerheads with the middle management. However, it has assorted specialisations. Professor Gadkari teaches organic farming, without wasting any water. Diplomacy skills of Sakshi Maharaj and Adityanath are world famous. If there is anyone in the world who understands importance of social media, it is Professor Shah. Arun Jaitley, who is known to be more favourite with the opposition camp, can be called the modern day Dale Carnegie. Admission Criteria: 25000+ followers on twitter. Noted Professors:

Narendra Modi: World geography Nitin Gadkari :- Organic farming Sakshi Maharaj and Yogi Adityanath:- Political correctness and creative writing Amit Shah :- Social Media management Arun Jaitley :- Diplomacy and HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE

Congress University: – This University can put any big B-school to shame, only university in India that teaches students how to make money quickly. Entrepreneur Robert Vadra is not only a noted alumnus of this university but also a guest lecturer here. He can teach students a thing or two about property management and farming. If you can’t learn the art of making money from this university, most probably you can’t learn it anywhere. Admission criteria: Naming everyone in Nehru-Gandhi family tree correctly. Noted Professors: Rahul Gandhi: – Professor of long term strategy Sonia Gandhi: – Hindi language and diction Robert Vadra :- Guest lecturer on farming and property management Abhishek Manu Singhvi :- Audio Visual Communications Manmohan Singh: – Oratory and the art of silent communication Chidambaram: – Accounting and financial (mis)management

AAP University: This University specialises in mass communication, activism and advertising. It might be better than most C-schools (communication schools please don’t misunderstand). AAP’s personal Wren and Martin THE ASHUTOSH will teach English at the university, making it the best place to learn the language. Professor Kejriwal’s expertise in advertising can put world’s best media planners to shame. Somnath Bharti’s work in the field of women empowerment is well known; hence his lecturers on women’s rights will be enlightening for students. University also has guest lectures by Vishal Dadlani, Vishal will teach students how to be a part time activist while trying to manage full time work. Admission Criteria: Ability to blame Modi maximum times during the interview Noted Professors: THE ASHUTOSH: Professor for English and Communication Shri Kejriwal: Dharna Management , activism, and use of Social Media, advertising and mass communication Somnath Bharti: Women’s rights Vishal Dadlani: Guest lecturer on how to manage activism along with a full-time job.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1312605_Wallpaper1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-congress-and-aap-start-their-own-universities-to-ensure-every-leader-has-a-degree-9751,"BJP, Congress and AAP start their own universities to ensure every leader has a degree",,1462861161.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-politicians-admit-that-they-have-run-out-of-free-things-they-can-promise-to-voters-9747,"Chennai: With a week remaining for the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, the politicians are really worried these days. The reason behind their concern is that they have run of free stuff they can promise to voters and are no longer sure what to say over the next week.

What else can they promise the voters

“There is absolutely nothing else we can promise them. We have already covered free mixer, free grinder, free gold, free electricity, free water, free goat, free cow, free laptop, free wifi, free fan, free food and free clothes, what is left? We can’t just tell the voters that this is all we have to offer and now wait for the polling day. We must keep on promising them more free stuff”, said a senior leader of a political party on the condition of anonymity.

When we asked whether they are effectively buying votes by promising all these freebies, the concerned leader got offended and said, “No, not at all. This is knowledgeable Chennai crowd; they can’t be swayed by freebies. In fact, we aren’t giving anything free to them. This is the reward they deserve for coming to the polling booth on the day of the election and saving democracy through their vote.”

As per sources, all the major parties in Tamil Nadu are going to meet at a secret location to come up with a list of things they can still promise for free to the voters. While some have proposed free tickets to Kabali, others have mentioned free trip to Singapore for every Tamil. Free tickets to all matches involving CSK was also proposed but later dropped when they were reminded that CSK is currently serving its suspension.

Meanwhile, AIADMK politicians have also expressed concern that they are running out of places to put Jayalalitha’s posters. “We will hire small airplanes to display Amma’s banners in the sky as there is no space left on the ground”, said a senior party functionary.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tamil-nadu-polls-759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tamil-nadu-politicians-admit-that-they-have-run-out-of-free-things-they-can-promise-to-voters-9747,Tamil Nadu politicians admit that they have run out of free things they can promise to voters,,1462787773.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/big-mncs-approach-kejriwal-for-degree-verification-and-background-checks-of-new-hires-9739,"Mumbai: Several major MNCs operating in India have approached Delhi CM Mr. Arvind Kejriwal to provide his services for background checks and degree verification of potential recruits.

This has happened after Kejriwal took up the initiative to verify educational credentials of PM of India Narendra Modi and created a stir in media by stating that PM Modi degree is fake without even looking at it. Even FBI sleuths struggle to verify documents at this speed and Kejriwal’s reputation has grown by leaps and bounds after this.

Kejriwal checking Modi’s degree

Not just educational qualifications, MNCs are looking at Mr. Kejriwal to provide character certificates of the applicants as well. Earlier, he used to inform Indians who is corrupt and who is not just by looking at the face of the person. Corrupt politicians still takes solace in the fact that Kejriwal never called them corrupt although legal courts of India have declared them corrupt based on the available evidence. Now it seems verifying documents and degrees is Kejriwal’s latest venture.

Anita Rai, HR head of a leading software firm which has asked for Kejriwal’s services, is optimistic that Kejriwal will come on board to assist them. “We hire thousands every year and we are not sure who has a real degree and experience letter. Once our newly hired CEO was later found out to be just 10th pass. We need people such as Kejriwal who are passionate about degrees.”

Ashutosh, who left all important work and went to Delhi University to find PM Bachelor’s degree, spoke to us over phone and said, “Sometimes Arvind Ji is unable to tell by looking at someone’s face if degree is genuine or not so we have to go to the University to check. Very soon I will be heading to Yale as well to look for Smriti Irani’s degree.”

When Ashutosh was asked why they didn’t check Jitender Tomar’s degree with such diligence, he disconnected the phone.

It is still not clear whether Kejriwal will be able to provide his services to these firms considering his busy schedule of tweeting about PM, watching new movies, protesting at Jantar-Mantar, holding Press conferences and eulogizing AAP government in Delhi on FM Radio.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BA-Pass-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/big-mncs-approach-kejriwal-for-degree-verification-and-background-checks-of-new-hires-9739,Big MNCs approach Kejriwal for degree verification and background checks of new hires,,1462695061.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/65-african-researchers-write-to-kanhaiya-kumar-to-do-a-tour-of-africa-for-his-phd-in-african-studies-9734,"Nairobi: 65 African researchers have written a letter to AISF student leader and ‘darling of media’ Kanhaiya Kumar.

What is the use of doing a PhD in African studies, when you are roaming across India and not Africa?” wondered an African researcher who is one of the 65 signatories

In that letter, they have requested the emerging leader Kanhaiya to do a tour of Africa, which can help in having a deeper understanding of his African studies. They have also revealed that Africa has more poor people than India and has even attached a few photos to show how Africa is suffering from poverty.

After going through the letter, we tried to contact a few of the signatories. Ablablabla Rabler, one such Researcher from the University of Nairobi, was humble enough to respond to us via a phone call.

When asked about the reason for sending a letter to the ‘messiah of media’, Ablablabla said, “Look! When we were trying to find out the ways to bring Africa out of poverty, we tried to look into all possible theories on economics and how to make sure that money reaches to the bottom. All our economic experiments met their dead-end. It was at this time, we read in online news websites from India that there is a new guy called Kanhaiya who has vowed to get poor people to be free from poverty. We listened to his speeches and were convinced that he is the guy we are looking for.”

“Not only his speeches, he also claimed that he is from a poor family and is living on stipends. But he is having an iPhone and travels in business class in flights. Even, well paid researchers like me cannot do it. So, if a poor in India has got access to this much luxury, Kanhaiya can definitely repeat the magic in Africa,” said Ablablabla who has done a PhD in African Economics.

“It is like a ‘one stone-two oranges’ for him too. Not only we will be benefited by his revolutionary ideas, he can also spend his time to work on his PhD thesis.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-slams-sonia-gandhi-for-getting-caught-up-in-scams-asks-her-to-come-clean-9659,"New Delhi. Country’s favorite Son-in-law Robert Vadra today stunned the Congress party and the whole nation by slamming Sonia Gandhi for getting caught up in scams.

Faking News has learnt that Vadra was very upset after seeing the name of “Signora Gandhi” figuring in the Italian court judgment on AgustaWestland bribery case. He was particularly upset after seeing “fam” in handwritten note with list of those who were paid kickbacks.

Vadra is not ready to listen

“This is very unprofessional on the part of Mrs. Gandhi. How can she allow the family’s name to appear in the bribery scandal? It hurts the image of honest farmers like me who are part of the family,” thundered Mr. Vadra.

The statement has shocked entire India as Vadra was not expected to name Sonia Gandhi. “I had still not recovered from the shock of Arvind Kejriwal mentioning Sonia Gandhi’s name, and now this! May god give me strength,” a political observer said.

Vadra, who of late has been commenting on many issues, especially those of corruption, is rumored to be eyeing the space vacated by Arvind Kejriwal, who once used to be an anti-corruption crusader before he joined Twitter and subsequently politics.

Vadra had only recently said that he was willing to join politics and serve people if that’s what people wanted.

“This helicopter scam is a big blot on my image by mere association with the family now. Now I’ll have to needlessly face questions about corruption by my family. The timing of this corruption coming out is suspect as I was just about to start serving people,” he said.

When Priyanka Vadra tried to confront Vadra, he slammed her too for getting caught up in alleged land scam in Himachal Pradesh.

“I demand that Sonia ji and her whole family come clean from these corruption allegations,” he added.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vadra-gandhis.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-slams-sonia-gandhi-for-getting-caught-up-in-scams-asks-her-to-come-clean-9659,"Robert Vadra slams Sonia Gandhi for getting caught up in scams, asks her to come clean",,1461913262.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a scathing attack against the Center and the Prime Minister, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded Modi to work with other states and make them send “Vayudoot” trains to Delhi i.e. trains carrying fresh air from scenic parts of the country, in order to fight the state’s pollution which seems unaffected by the odd-even rule.

Kejriwal started with a question as he spoke to Faking News. “When Modi can send water to the drought-affected areas, why can’t he send fresh air from serene places like Uttarakhand, Ooty and Kodaikanal?” he asked the PM in what seemed like a direct attack on him.

“Look at these people breathing fresh air, can’t they help Delhi people?”

“Those trains can directly run around Delhi and pump fresh air in the atmosphere, and thereby, sustain Delhi’s biosphere,” said Kejriwal as he continued to explain the reason behind his suggestion.

The demand by the AAP supremo and Delhi CM is reported to be inspired by Jaldoot trains run by the center, which ferries water to drought hit areas.

Neutral experts say that the demand is not absurd and the center should think about it.

“Don’t we have oxygen cylinders?” a neutral expert cum independent commentator explained, “The idea of carrying air for breathing where it is in scarcity is perfectly scientific, and so is the idea to have Vayudoot trains. Delhi is not too far away from places like Shimla and Nainital, which are well connected with railways, so execution shouldn’t be a problem.”

Delhi CM praised the independent commentator and re-tweeted the neutral expert before revealing that the massive ads given by the Delhi government were actually a part of this plan to demand Vayudoot trains.

“Our ads about odd-even have been aired on national television channels and we have even given print ads in local newspapers of many states. Now all these states know our problem. They must come together and help us. If they don’t do it, we’ve to conclude that woh sab mile huye hain,” Kejriwal said, appealing for help.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kejriwal-pointing.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-asks-center-to-run-vayudoot-trains-for-bringing-fresh-air-from-other-states-to-delhi-9653,"Kejriwal asks Center to run ""Vayudoot"" trains for bringing fresh air from other states to Delhi",,1461832640.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/india-outsources-visa-services-to-china-will-let-them-issue-visas-to-india-9625,"New Delhi: Attacked from all sides for its flip-flop over the visa to exiled Uighur-Chinese leader Dolkun Isa. Narendra Modi Government has decided to outsource Indian Visa services to China. China will now decide who gets visa to India and who doesn’t.

Now Indian Visa will also be Made In China

As per experts, this step is likely to bring efficiency to Indian immigration system and we are less likely to see any embarrassment like the one we saw after the visa to Mr. Dolkun Isa.

While political opponents have roundly criticized this step and accused Modi government of bowing down to the Chinese, Government officials are defending this and claiming that this has been done only to save money and increase efficiency of the system.

“Outsourcing to cut costs and enhance efficiency is a global reality these days. Not just corporations, but Governments are also looking to outsource so India has decided to go down that path as well. Instead of India first issuing a visa, then China objecting and then cancellation of visa, we can directly let China decide who gets to enter India and who doesn’t. This will greatly improve the general efficiency of our immigration system”, said a spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs.

A BJP spokesperson on the condition of anonymity said, “We are just delegating tasks that aren’t productive to China so that our fellow Indian citizens are free to do more important things, like trending #ModiSlapsChina on Twitter. China can decide who gets to enter India but we will decide who gets to leave India so we are still in control.”

When we asked the spokesperson how Mr. Vijay Mallya escaped if India was deciding who gets to leave India, he said, “That is what I am saying. Earlier, we were so busy checking who gets to enter that we couldn’t focus on wjho is leaving India. Now with this task outsourced to China, our officials can fully concentrate on the Mallyas of this world.”

Meanwhile, China has clarified that Narendra Modi can travel wherever he please as of now and they aren’t going to protest against the visa stamps on his passport.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/indian_visa-450x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/india-outsources-visa-services-to-china-will-let-them-issue-visas-to-india-9625,"India outsources Visa services to China, will let them issue visas to India",,1461576542.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Pankaja Munde’s controversial selfie

A 3 days workshop will be conducted in Delhi starting this Friday and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the selfie-man himself, will be conducting this workshop. All senior leaders of BJP from all over India are expected to attend this workshop.

As per the leaked program of the workshop, Narendra Modi’s lecture will be followed by a practical game. Participants will be given various situations and then asked questions like, if Arnab is watching you, will you click a selfie here, is this 1 selfie worth 1 hour of humiliation on The Newshour, are you willing to trend for a day on social media over a selfie etc.

Making this announcement, Minister of state PMO Mr. Jitendra Singh said, “Following PM Modi’s footsteps and taking selfies everywhere you go is appreciable but not advisable. There are many things one must keep in mind before deciding to click a selfie. We are not millennials who absolutely have to click a selfie every few minutes. We are all seasoned politicians and must act like it.”

As per sources, after this workshop, PM Modi is also considering a Mann Ki Baat program on selfies. “Mr. Modi is always focused on the problems our youngsters face and a poor quality selfie is one of the biggest problems facing urban youth today. Some youngsters are even losing their lives while trying to click that perfect selfie, it is about time Government took note and worked to stop such tragedies”, a PMO source said explaining the rationale behind this.

SHIT stands for Solving Hardships in Information Technology and is aimed at solving the problems faced by IT Engineers in their work.

PM Modi after announcing SHIT

As per a survey, IT Engineers are the most stressed, over-worked and under-appreciated employees in India and to reduce their stress, PM Modi has launched this scheme.

Making the announcement, PM Modi said that the scheme will offer many benefits to IT Engineers like working from home and free broadband access without restrictions to download all latest films and TV shows. Those who want to work from office will get edible food in office canteens and smoking zones will be located within 10 meters of one’s desk.

Every employee will get to sit on the bench for a minimum period of 4 months every year during which (s)he can catch up on all the movies (s)he has downloaded via torrents. There will also be a provision of paid leaves which will not require approval from manager so that they can finally travel to the places which they keep liking on Facebook.

The scheme will also address the biggest concern techies have, on-site placement. After every 2 years of service, IT Engineers will get one on-site placement under SHIT.

Asked about the controversial acronym, IT secretary said, “There is nothing controversial at all. Most IT employees are made to feel like shit by their bosses anyway. On the contrary, this scheme name SHIT will touch a chord with the IT employees. They will feel associated with it right away! Their job is shit and they know it.”

Meanwhile, opposition parties have attacked Narendra Modi for launching SHIT and doing nothing about PEE, Problems of Engineering Employees. “This is selective appeasement of IT Engineers, what about other engineers?

PM Modi urging people to raise their finger and place it on their lips as part of ShutUp India intiative

It is aimed at silencing those who act as self-styled spokespersons of government and always have wrong things to say at wrong time. If the experiment becomes successful, government will extend its definition to cover celebrities and other public figures as well.

“Whenever we are in a position to corner the opposition on key issues, someone from our side bails them out by issuing stupid statements bordering on hyper-nationalism. Thanks to such comments, Modi government has gone to back foot more number of times than the PM Modi has gone to foreign visits during his 2 years in office. Modi ji’s situation is similar to Dhoni’s situation in Team India’s T20 semi-final match against WI. Whenever fielder took catch, it turned out to be a no-ball and batsmen rather than getting out, were awarded with a free-hit,” explained parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu who is at his wit’s end trying to convince opposition not to raise these issues and let the parliament function.

Explaining the salient features of the ShutUp India, Naidu further told that just like Swach Bharat Mission and Make In India, this initiative will also have healthy participation from corporate sector. Center fresh – ‘Zuban pe rakhe lagam’ and Chlormint – ‘Dobara mat puchna’ have already confirmed their participation in ShutUp India. However Alpenliebe – ‘Aise jeebh laplapayi’ has decided to stay away from this campaign as it will damage its brand positioning.

Reacting to this news AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has voluntarily told Shaitaan Khopdi™ that he will not stop talking rubbish even if Modi puts knife on his neck.

“This is emergency like situation. Government is snatching our freedom to speak nonsense. India cannot survive if people stop talking stupid stuff,” told an MBA student from IIPM who earns his bread and butter by talking non-stop non-sense during client presentations.

Meanwhile an NGO called ‘Cheekh’ has launched an agitation to oppose the ‘ShutUp India’ campaign. Star activist of this NGO ‘Cheekhti Desai’ is famous for opposing anything and everything being done by government and barging into everywhere she is asked not to enter.

This time she and other activists tried to forcefully entered TimesNow studio demanding their right to debate on PrimeTime NewsHour. But unfortunately they ran into a raging Arnab Goswami.

Making this announcement, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said, “I had promised the women of Bihar that I will stop their male counterparts from using alcohol and now is the time to fulfill that promise. They will no longer be able to drink alcohol, spray alcohol on their bodies or apply alcohol on their face after shaving. Now alcohol will become as common in Bihar as girls in Mechanical Engineering.”

Bihar Government is also looking for ways to stop the broadcast of Fogg deodorant ads on TV. “After listening repeatedly to Fogg chal raha hai, some people may start believing that we have failed to implement a total ban on deodorants. We don’t want any such misinformation to spread”, said Nitish Kumar.

“Our fight is not limited to Whiskey or Rum or Vodka or Beer; this is a fight against alcohol so how can we spare deodorants and perfumes? These products contain much higher percentage of alcohol than your beers or wines. If we spare them then we may get accused of favoritism by Whiskey manufactures so to ensure fairness, we have placed a ban on these products as well”, said a senior minister in Bihar Government.

Save water, bath rarely

India has faced two consecutive droughts over the last two years depleting further the already depleted water resources. Many states are facing extreme water scarcity and during these tough times, PM Modi has recognized the contribution of Engineering and Medical students towards preserving water.

“Water level is going down gradually, we should work to conserve water. Water conservation is something all of us need to work on and everyone should be connected to a People’s Movement to conserve water,” said Modi.

“Ankit from IIT wrote to me saying that saying that Engineering students lead the way in conserving water by taking a bath only when absolutely necessary. He also mentioned how they generally drink even cheap whiskey neat and use water only on special occasions. I am truly impressed by their dedication in conserving water”, Modi said applauding these students.

Further, Modi added, “Kanika from AIIMS wrote that Medical students, including girls, too contribute to conservation of water by not taking baths, often even after dissecting dead bodies. Truly commendable.”

Those letters convinced Modi that Indian youth, especially Engineering and Medical students, are skilled and motivated enough to lead the People’s Movement to conserve water.

So touched was Modi that he announced, on the Mann ki baat program itself, scholarships to all students who conserve water by only taking a bath occasionally. They will also be provided accreditation as Environmental activists.

Modi also said, “Kanhaiya from Delhi wrote to me that he only takes shower when Delhi Police ‘watercannons’ him during protests but ye thoda jyaada ho gaya.”

“I will not take bath, it’s not written in the Constitution”

His comments came against the backdrop of RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s suggestion that the new generation – especially Engineering students, need to be taught to take bath every day.

Taking on RSS chief, Owaisi said there is nothing in the Indian Constitution which forces him to take bath.

“I follow the constitution of this country and it does not force me to take bath. They (RSS) are trying to force their ideology and I’m ready to debate on this,” he said.

“I won’t take bath even if you put a knife to my throat. Nowhere in the Constitution, is it written that one should take bath,” he added.

Owaisi’s comments gained unconditional support from almost all Student organisations. Engineering students showered praises on twitter.

Trump’s reaction upon hearing support from Indian men who had lost their girlfriends to US grooms.

Donald Trump, the probable Republican candidate for the US Presidential election has got an unexpected supporter from India, Manikandan (28) hailing from Velachery area of Chennai and working in Some Solutions for six long years is the guy trumpeting to make Trump the next POTUS.

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, Manikandan said, “All these years, I knew politics as much as main stream media knew facts. I never voted, never cared for who won or lost. All that mattered to me was my Divya. She was my angel, my princess and my queen. We had been in relationship for eight years. We even decided upon our children’s names. But, every dream of me got crushed because of that b@st*rd Dinesh.”

Manikandan, who was smiling five minutes before, started palpitating and fuming with palms clutched. Gritting his teeth, he continued, “My parents were very much happy to accept Divya. But, she and her parents made a strict condition that she will have to settle in USA after marriage. Working for a US client, I pitched in for my H1B visa. I had picked fight for my visa from my manager to embassy gate security. But all my efforts went futile, as I am unable to get visa. In the meantime, Divya’s parents got this Dinesh’s profile. Divya dumped me last month and has now landed in Boston marrying Dinesh, taking away all my happiness.”

Controlling his tears, Mani continued, “To quench my depression, I started drinking in my room. Two days back, I was watching this white haired guy talking in TV. The moment he said that ‘he will build wall to prevent migrants from entering US‘, I had a sudden surge of energy. I went and kissed the TV screen. Then, I started reading more about him and got convinced that he is the right man for that job.”

“I will be spamming every mailbox, every timeline and every hashtag lending support for Trump and convincing the Americans there that he must be the next President. Already, I’m all praise for Trump in client calls everyday. Not only me, we have a Facebook group with 3 lakh men already. We all share similar sorrows – of losing our GFs to US-based Indian grooms. I am sure that we all can convert atleast a million Americans in the next eight months to vote for Trump. This is not to satiate our sorrows, but to prevent future men to lose their Girlfriends to US-based Indian men, ” said Mani, who then shouted ‘Trump for President’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donald_trump9.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/having-lost-his-girlfriend-to-us-based-indian-groom-chennai-man-to-do-ferocious-online-campaign-in-support-of-donald-trump-9259,"Having lost his girlfriend to US-based Indian groom, Chennai man to do ferocious online campaign in support of Donald Trump",,1458448029.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Gandhi scion, who has a fine history of solving complex problems faced by today’s society with his wit and sarcasm has already claimed a victory of sorts against RSS.

As per sources, this image played a major role in RSS decision

A couple of years back when the world was tormented with Narendra Modi’s suits and could not take it any longer, aggrieved parties formed a committee and approached Rahul Gandhi for a solution. Rahulji, always sympathetic towards social causes took up an analytical approach towards the problem. He valuated cost of the suit to be INR 10 lakhs and criticized PM for the same. This incident left such a deep scar on Modi’s psyche that he has never worn a suit since that day as explained by Rahul Gandhi himself. Thus the universe was spared from Narendra Modi’s suits and a major catastrophe was avoided.

In recent times, Rahulji has guided his followers to throw jibes at RSS using the term ‘Khaki Chaddi’. His efforts have borne fruit now as RSS finally decides to revist their dress code. Full length trousers as opposed to short pantswill have a trickle-down effect on Indian manufacturing and low-skilled labour economy, explained a Congress mouthpiece. Rahulji, donning his analytical cap again has predicted the multiplying effect to be in the range of 2-3 percentage points of India’s GDP. This is expected to be 3 -4 times more than ‘fair and lovely’ money recovered by Arun Jaitley over the next 3 years.

Rahul Gandhi is speechless at his own ingenuity

An emergency high level meet of senior leaders was held late last night at Party President Sonia Gandhi’s house to discuss ‘disruption strategies’. Sources within the party say that a consensus couldn’t be reached over the issue till Rahul Gandhi intervened.

Faking News reporter spoke to a senior Congress “The meeting was chaotic and with so many options we needed to narrow down. That’s when Rahul Gandhi suggested that we toss a coin and decide. It was almost a watershed moment. I mean senior leaders with years of experience were present at the meet but none of them could think of the coin toss idea. It was Rahulji’s ingenuity that solved our problem.”

Many party workers were of the opinion that Rahul Gandhi should be made the party President given that his idea was a ‘huge contribution’ to the party.

This will ensure railway tracks remain free of obstructions and all railway operations and service continue as usual.

This will be a much needed investment in Indian infrastructure which usually lags behind with demand and need of the hour. Just like freight corridor soon India will be first country to have a protest corridor.

Protesters disrupting railways will be a thing of the past soon

The decision to do so came after Jats protesters demanding caste based reservations for Jats in Haryana hijacked railway tracks and sat there for hours leading to delays in hundreds of trains and inconvenience to lakhs of people.

Informing about the decision, Railway minister Mr. Suresh Prabhu said, “ I am tired of these annual rituals in Rajasthan and Haryana where Gujjars and Jats will come and just sit on railways tracks demanding reservations. They play cards, smoke hookah and cook Halwa-Poori there”

Expressing his pain Mr. Prabhu continued, “We already provide fair reservation through first come first serve basis ticketing system in Railways and I can’t give reservations in government jobs. Similarly, every now and then Maoist blow up railway tracks. Even a small road accident is protested on railway tracks. I will give protesters separate tracks to play with”

On being asked that this will need huge investment and how will Railways get that money Mr. Prabhu said, “The damage caused to Railways due to protests is so much that we will recover this cost in 5 years if protesters stick to dedicated tracks made for them. The next Railway Budget will have detailed plan”

People who indulge in open defecation on railway tracks are very happy with this announcement as now they will have more space to explore.

Narendra Modi Government has decided to outsource Indian Visa services to China. China will now decide who gets visa to India and who doesn’t.

Now Indian Visa will also be Made In China

As per experts, this step is likely to bring efficiency to Indian immigration system and we are less likely to see any embarrassment like the one we saw after the visa to Mr. Dolkun Isa.

While political opponents have roundly criticized this step and accused Modi government of bowing down to the Chinese, Government officials are defending this and claiming that this has been done only to save money and increase efficiency of the system.

“Outsourcing to cut costs and enhance efficiency is a global reality these days. Not just corporations, but Governments are also looking to outsource so India has decided to go down that path as well. Instead of India first issuing a visa, then China objecting and then cancellation of visa, we can directly let China decide who gets to enter India and who doesn’t. This will greatly improve the general efficiency of our immigration system”, said a spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs.

A BJP spokesperson on the condition of anonymity said, “We are just delegating tasks that aren’t productive to China so that our fellow Indian citizens are free to do more important things, like trending #ModiSlapsChina on Twitter. China can decide who gets to enter India but we will decide who gets to leave India so we are still in control.”

When we asked the spokesperson how Mr. Vijay Mallya escaped if India was deciding who gets to leave India, he said, “That is what I am saying. Earlier, we were so busy checking who gets to enter that we couldn’t focus on wjho is leaving India. Now with this task outsourced to China, our officials can fully concentrate on the Mallyas of this world.”

Pankaja Munde’s controversial selfie

A 3 days workshop will be conducted in Delhi starting this Friday and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the selfie-man himself, will be conducting this workshop. All senior leaders of BJP from all over India are expected to attend this workshop.

As per the leaked program of the workshop, Narendra Modi’s lecture will be followed by a practical game. Participants will be given various situations and then asked questions like, if Arnab is watching you, will you click a selfie here, is this 1 selfie worth 1 hour of humiliation on The Newshour, are you willing to trend for a day on social media over a selfie etc.

Making this announcement, Minister of state PMO Mr. Jitendra Singh said, “Following PM Modi’s footsteps and taking selfies everywhere you go is appreciable but not advisable. There are many things one must keep in mind before deciding to click a selfie. We are not millennials who absolutely have to click a selfie every few minutes. We are all seasoned politicians and must act like it.”

As per sources, after this workshop, PM Modi is also considering a Mann Ki Baat program on selfies. “Mr. Modi is always focused on the problems our youngsters face and a poor quality selfie is one of the biggest problems facing urban youth today. Some youngsters are even losing their lives while trying to click that perfect selfie, it is about time Government took note and worked to stop such tragedies”, a PMO source said explaining the rationale behind this.

SHIT stands for Solving Hardships in Information Technology and is aimed at solving the problems faced by IT Engineers in their work.

PM Modi after announcing SHIT

As per a survey, IT Engineers are the most stressed, over-worked and under-appreciated employees in India and to reduce their stress, PM Modi has launched this scheme.

Making the announcement, PM Modi said that the scheme will offer many benefits to IT Engineers like working from home and free broadband access without restrictions to download all latest films and TV shows. Those who want to work from office will get edible food in office canteens and smoking zones will be located within 10 meters of one’s desk.

Every employee will get to sit on the bench for a minimum period of 4 months every year during which (s)he can catch up on all the movies (s)he has downloaded via torrents. There will also be a provision of paid leaves which will not require approval from manager so that they can finally travel to the places which they keep liking on Facebook.

The scheme will also address the biggest concern techies have, on-site placement. After every 2 years of service, IT Engineers will get one on-site placement under SHIT.

Asked about the controversial acronym, IT secretary said, “There is nothing controversial at all. Most IT employees are made to feel like shit by their bosses anyway. On the contrary, this scheme name SHIT will touch a chord with the IT employees. They will feel associated with it right away! Their job is shit and they know it.”

Meanwhile, opposition parties have attacked Narendra Modi for launching SHIT and doing nothing about PEE, Problems of Engineering Employees. “This is selective appeasement of IT Engineers, what about other engineers?

PM Modi urging people to raise their finger and place it on their lips as part of ShutUp India intiative

It is aimed at silencing those who act as self-styled spokespersons of government and always have wrong things to say at wrong time. If the experiment becomes successful, government will extend its definition to cover celebrities and other public figures as well.

“Whenever we are in a position to corner the opposition on key issues, someone from our side bails them out by issuing stupid statements bordering on hyper-nationalism. Thanks to such comments, Modi government has gone to back foot more number of times than the PM Modi has gone to foreign visits during his 2 years in office. Modi ji’s situation is similar to Dhoni’s situation in Team India’s T20 semi-final match against WI. Whenever fielder took catch, it turned out to be a no-ball and batsmen rather than getting out, were awarded with a free-hit,” explained parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu who is at his wit’s end trying to convince opposition not to raise these issues and let the parliament function.

Explaining the salient features of the ShutUp India, Naidu further told that just like Swach Bharat Mission and Make In India, this initiative will also have healthy participation from corporate sector. Center fresh – ‘Zuban pe rakhe lagam’ and Chlormint – ‘Dobara mat puchna’ have already confirmed their participation in ShutUp India. However Alpenliebe – ‘Aise jeebh laplapayi’ has decided to stay away from this campaign as it will damage its brand positioning.

Reacting to this news AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has voluntarily told Shaitaan Khopdi™ that he will not stop talking rubbish even if Modi puts knife on his neck.

“This is emergency like situation. Government is snatching our freedom to speak nonsense. India cannot survive if people stop talking stupid stuff,” told an MBA student from IIPM who earns his bread and butter by talking non-stop non-sense during client presentations.

Meanwhile an NGO called ‘Cheekh’ has launched an agitation to oppose the ‘ShutUp India’ campaign. Star activist of this NGO ‘Cheekhti Desai’ is famous for opposing anything and everything being done by government and barging into everywhere she is asked not to enter.

This time she and other activists tried to forcefully entered TimesNow studio demanding their right to debate on PrimeTime NewsHour. But unfortunately they ran into a raging Arnab Goswami.

Making this announcement, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said, “I had promised the women of Bihar that I will stop their male counterparts from using alcohol and now is the time to fulfill that promise. They will no longer be able to drink alcohol, spray alcohol on their bodies or apply alcohol on their face after shaving. Now alcohol will become as common in Bihar as girls in Mechanical Engineering.”

Bihar Government is also looking for ways to stop the broadcast of Fogg deodorant ads on TV. “After listening repeatedly to Fogg chal raha hai, some people may start believing that we have failed to implement a total ban on deodorants. We don’t want any such misinformation to spread”, said Nitish Kumar.

“Our fight is not limited to Whiskey or Rum or Vodka or Beer; this is a fight against alcohol so how can we spare deodorants and perfumes? These products contain much higher percentage of alcohol than your beers or wines. If we spare them then we may get accused of favoritism by Whiskey manufactures so to ensure fairness, we have placed a ban on these products as well”, said a senior minister in Bihar Government.

Save water, bath rarely

India has faced two consecutive droughts over the last two years depleting further the already depleted water resources. Many states are facing extreme water scarcity and during these tough times, PM Modi has recognized the contribution of Engineering and Medical students towards preserving water.

“Water level is going down gradually, we should work to conserve water. Water conservation is something all of us need to work on and everyone should be connected to a People’s Movement to conserve water,” said Modi.

“Ankit from IIT wrote to me saying that saying that Engineering students lead the way in conserving water by taking a bath only when absolutely necessary. He also mentioned how they generally drink even cheap whiskey neat and use water only on special occasions. I am truly impressed by their dedication in conserving water”, Modi said applauding these students.

Further, Modi added, “Kanika from AIIMS wrote that Medical students, including girls, too contribute to conservation of water by not taking baths, often even after dissecting dead bodies. Truly commendable.”

Those letters convinced Modi that Indian youth, especially Engineering and Medical students, are skilled and motivated enough to lead the People’s Movement to conserve water.

So touched was Modi that he announced, on the Mann ki baat program itself, scholarships to all students who conserve water by only taking a bath occasionally. They will also be provided accreditation as Environmental activists.

Modi also said, “Kanhaiya from Delhi wrote to me that he only takes shower when Delhi Police ‘watercannons’ him during protests but ye thoda jyaada ho gaya.”

“I will not take bath, it’s not written in the Constitution”

His comments came against the backdrop of RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s suggestion that the new generation – especially Engineering students, need to be taught to take bath every day.

Taking on RSS chief, Owaisi said there is nothing in the Indian Constitution which forces him to take bath.

“I follow the constitution of this country and it does not force me to take bath. They (RSS) are trying to force their ideology and I’m ready to debate on this,” he said.

“I won’t take bath even if you put a knife to my throat. Nowhere in the Constitution, is it written that one should take bath,” he added.

Owaisi’s comments gained unconditional support from almost all Student organisations. Engineering students showered praises on twitter.

“Finally, we found a leader who understands us,” tweeted an Engineering student from Hyderabad.

“Other than this, in the same interview he said that he would be happy if Amitabh Bachchan becomes the next president of India.

“We immediately confirmed with forensic experts and found that it was a genuine video; no tampering. Our sources close to his family doctor confirmed he had not complained of any medical condition. Since it’s not rainy season yet, his DTH connection must also fine and he has been reading newspapers regularly to keep himself abreast of party’s view on different matters, so it was totally shocking!” the BJP leader said.

“The party parliamentary board unanimously concluded that something was wrong,” he further added, “We decided to not be silent spectator anymore and that’s why we have sent him a show-cause notice. We can’t afford a situation where our workers are totally confused over what exactly was happening.”

Trump’s reaction upon hearing support from Indian men who had lost their girlfriends to US grooms.

Donald Trump, the probable Republican candidate for the US Presidential election has got an unexpected supporter from India, Manikandan (28) hailing from Velachery area of Chennai and working in Some Solutions for six long years is the guy trumpeting to make Trump the next POTUS.

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, Manikandan said, “All these years, I knew politics as much as main stream media knew facts. I never voted, never cared for who won or lost. All that mattered to me was my Divya. She was my angel, my princess and my queen. We had been in relationship for eight years. We even decided upon our children’s names. But, every dream of me got crushed because of that b@st*rd Dinesh.”

Manikandan, who was smiling five minutes before, started palpitating and fuming with palms clutched. Gritting his teeth, he continued, “My parents were very much happy to accept Divya. But, she and her parents made a strict condition that she will have to settle in USA after marriage. Working for a US client, I pitched in for my H1B visa. I had picked fight for my visa from my manager to embassy gate security. But all my efforts went futile, as I am unable to get visa. In the meantime, Divya’s parents got this Dinesh’s profile. Divya dumped me last month and has now landed in Boston marrying Dinesh, taking away all my happiness.”

Controlling his tears, Mani continued, “To quench my depression, I started drinking in my room. Two days back, I was watching this white haired guy talking in TV. The moment he said that ‘he will build wall to prevent migrants from entering US‘, I had a sudden surge of energy. I went and kissed the TV screen. Then, I started reading more about him and got convinced that he is the right man for that job.”

“I will be spamming every mailbox, every timeline and every hashtag lending support for Trump and convincing the Americans there that he must be the next President. Already, I’m all praise for Trump in client calls everyday. Not only me, we have a Facebook group with 3 lakh men already. We all share similar sorrows – of losing our GFs to US-based Indian grooms. I am sure that we all can convert atleast a million Americans in the next eight months to vote for Trump. This is not to satiate our sorrows, but to prevent future men to lose their Girlfriends to US-based Indian men, ” said Mani, who then shouted ‘Trump for President’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donald_trump9.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/having-lost-his-girlfriend-to-us-based-indian-groom-chennai-man-to-do-ferocious-online-campaign-in-support-of-donald-trump-9259,"Having lost his girlfriend to US-based Indian groom, Chennai man to do ferocious online campaign in support of Donald Trump",,1458448029.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Gandhi scion, who has a fine history of solving complex problems faced by today’s society with his wit and sarcasm has already claimed a victory of sorts against RSS.

As per sources, this image played a major role in RSS decision

A couple of years back when the world was tormented with Narendra Modi’s suits and could not take it any longer, aggrieved parties formed a committee and approached Rahul Gandhi for a solution. Rahulji, always sympathetic towards social causes took up an analytical approach towards the problem. He valuated cost of the suit to be INR 10 lakhs and criticized PM for the same. This incident left such a deep scar on Modi’s psyche that he has never worn a suit since that day as explained by Rahul Gandhi himself. Thus the universe was spared from Narendra Modi’s suits and a major catastrophe was avoided.

In recent times, Rahulji has guided his followers to throw jibes at RSS using the term ‘Khaki Chaddi’. His efforts have borne fruit now as RSS finally decides to revist their dress code. Full length trousers as opposed to short pantswill have a trickle-down effect on Indian manufacturing and low-skilled labour economy, explained a Congress mouthpiece. Rahulji, donning his analytical cap again has predicted the multiplying effect to be in the range of 2-3 percentage points of India’s GDP. This is expected to be 3 -4 times more than ‘fair and lovely’ money recovered by Arun Jaitley over the next 3 years.

Faking News reporter spoke to a senior Congress “The meeting was chaotic and with so many options we needed to narrow down. That’s when Rahul Gandhi suggested that we toss a coin and decide. It was almost a watershed moment. I mean senior leaders with years of experience were present at the meet but none of them could think of the coin toss idea. It was Rahulji’s ingenuity that solved our problem.”

Many party workers were of the opinion that Rahul Gandhi should be made the party President given that his idea was a ‘huge contribution’ to the party.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politicians-appeal-to-students-to-mention-their-caste-in-suicide-notes-8791,"New Delhi: In a rare show of unity, politicians from all parties came together and requested students to mention their caste clearly in their suicide notes.

All party meeting to discuss this important issue

This decision was reached at an all party meeting convened at the residence of Lok Sabha speaker, Sumitra Mahajan. The appeal, carrying signatures of all senior politicians, will be published in all Indian dailies tomorrow. This decision was taken after the confusion over the suicide victim in Hyderabad with some people claiming he wasn’t a Dalit.

It was concluded by the politicians during that meeting that since they can’t control suicides, they might as well use it for their political gains in a clear defined way

Speaking to Faking News on the condition of anonymity, a senior politician from a party said, “We are not making this request for ourselves, we are doing this for the benefit of the public. If they mention their caste clearly then only those politicians who are looking to exploit that caste will head there. Right now we create needless nuisance and traffic jams when all of us turn up at the place of suicide at the same time. We don’t want to inconvenience people like that.”

“Another thing to consider is that First-mover advantage is huge in crocodile tears industry. Now if a person from my caste has committed suicide, I should be the first one to go there and cash in on the high running emotions but it doesn’t always happen because of the confusion over caste. By the time we clear up our confusion and find out the caste, we find that someone else has already landed there. We need to resolve it”, explained the politician.

Supporting the arguments of his colleague, another veteran politician from a rival party said, “We generally have no problem finding out the caste as we have memorized all the castes in India but sometimes we have people with no last name or you have these neutral last names like Kumar creating confusion because we aren’t always sure who they are. Only to the people with those unclear last names, we have made the request.”

When we asked whether this political unity will ensure Parliament works smoothly during the next session, a politician laughed and said, “All party unity is over important issues, like Caste politics or communal politics, We can’t have it for trivial issues like the economy or the country.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/modi-embed.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politicians-appeal-to-students-to-mention-their-caste-in-suicide-notes-8791,Politicians appeal to students to mention their caste in suicide notes,,1453369841.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/new-helipad-to-be-constructed-in-hyderabad-univ-campus-to-cater-to-huge-inflow-of-politicians-and-media-8787,"Hyderabad: Private sector aviation in Telangana has seen a surge of activity after fresh incident of selective intolerance was recently reported at central university of Hyderabad, owing to which lot of politicians and senior media persons are making daily trips between Hyderabad and Delhi/ Mumbai.

The new helipad for the convenience of media and politicians

Also to avoid road traffic congestion a lot of politicians are feeling a need to take helicopter rides directly from airport to Hyderabad university to save travel time and invest that valuable time in propaganda.

Consequently a new helipad may soon be constructed within the Hyderabad university campus to cater to convenience of top political brass in the country.

Manjunath Kattappaswamy who is MD of Udaan Aviators and specializes in “on-demand” helicopters and private jets to VIPs and VVIPs, spoke to our reporter about sudden increase in private aviation demand from rest-of-India to Hyderabad.

He said, “I won’t name my customers but demand for private aviation has seen a surge here. One of my top customers who generally travels between Delhi, Italy and Thailand has asked for a sudden trip to Hyderabad. One of the senior journalists who travels from Delhi to Srinagar occasionally, too enquired about our service. It’s tough to arrange at such short notice but then we are the specialists. ”

Mr. Kattappaswamy further continued, “These rides are very-very costly, but then money is not an issue for old journos and new politicians. They are very well funded by their investors,” Mr. Kattappaswamy winked.

“Which is why we not only provide aviation solutions but also focus on infrastructure. There is news that new helipad will be constructed within Hyderabad university campus. That was our initiative. We have also asked Hyderabad civic authorities to plan a straight no-stops private expressway from Hyderabad Airport to Hyderabad university which will be used only by VVIPs. There is no point in me flying an important VVIP from Delhi to Hyderabad Airport in 2 hours and then him taking 3 hours to reach from airport to university. We aim to optimize all the legs of our customer’s journey,” he reasoned.

While it is not yet clear if these new infrastructure plans will materialize very soon but it is being rumored that a branch of Hyderabad university campus may be temporarily setup within 5 KM radius of airport so that politicians can quickly come in via morning flight, get photos clicked “on campus” while protesting on intolerance, and leave by a same day flight in the evening.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hyd-helipad.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/new-helipad-to-be-constructed-in-hyderabad-univ-campus-to-cater-to-huge-inflow-of-politicians-and-media-8787,New helipad to be constructed in Hyderabad Univ campus to cater to huge inflow of politicians and media,,1453359723.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Bihar ka future bright hai

The self-appointed spokesman of Maha-gathbandhan Mr. Lalu was talking to media when he was asked about the recent crime reports in Bihar where MLA from ruling JD(U) party helped her husband escape from jail.

He rubbished the reports and said, “People are saying there is no law and order in Bihar. Arre why do you need law and order? Can’t every one regulate his own self? Sab zimmedaar log hai na bhai? Similarly why do we need to study and get literate when we can have a buffalo at home? We can sell milk and earn money. Why do we need electricity when the wind that blows in our fields keeps us cool? We the people of Bihar need to get away from these distractions in order to make fast progress.”

When Lalu was asked about his notions of progress and development, he laughed loudly and said, “Dhat budbak, ka development rota rehta ho? We the people of Bihar need to go back to our roots. The very basics, all the old practices need to be re-vitalized. And when the “old” comes, the “new” has to go. So we plan to abolish literacy by 2016, electricity by 2017 and law and order will be totally gone by 2019. Samjhe?”

While Laloo was speaking to the media the ceiling fan which was menacingly rotating above his head since few minutes came down crashing and fell near his feet.

Sources say that the delay was caused as there is no one to carry around his footwear.

Look who’s back !

Speaking to Faking News, Congress Party spokesperson said, “Rahulji was supposed to return on the 4th from Europe. Few beaches were part of his itinerary but since there was no party worker there who would carry his footwear while he entered the water. He is not used to carrying his shoes, so we had to wait before someone did that for him.”

Apparently, a few party workers are planning to fly to Europe later in the evening to ease Rahul Gandhi from his ‘who will carry my shoes’ predicament.

If sources are to be believed, a high level meeting was called by Sonia Gandhi to discuss this issue and provide assistance to Rahul Gandhi in the quickest possible way. “There was chaos at Soniaji’s residence with every party worker volunteering to go to Europe, but Narayansamy was unanimously chosen by all to help Rahulji with his shoes,” said a party spokesperson.

Some party leaders were worried with the ‘lack of leadership’ due to Rahul Gandhi’s absence.

“Although Budget session is some time away, we need Rahulji’s presence to disrupt the Parliament. When he comes up excuses to stall the Parliament proceedings, even BJP doesn’t counter him,” said another party member.

Rahul Gandhi’s whereabouts have been kept secret a few senior Congress leaders are regularly are in touch with him to keep him abreast of the happenings in the country.

A senior Congress leader on the condition of anonymity also said that Rahul Gandhi’s trip is not all about pleasure.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-hires-hrithik-roshan-as-brand-ambassador-to-point-an-extra-finger-for-blaming-others-8722,"New Delhi. Realizing that the normal five fingers of a human hand were not the natural representation for the superhuman abilities of Aam Aadmi Party where it can point fingers at more than five people on an issue at the same occasion, the anti-Modi anti-corruption party has hired Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan as its brand ambassador. Hrithik has six fingers in on his right hand.

“We already have many Bollywood celebrities supporting us but we were looking for someone who can perfectly represent us,” party spokesperson Raghav Chadda confirmed the move, “While abuses by likes of Raghu and Vishal represent our attitude towards criticism, the sixth finger of Hrithik will represent our abilities to be one-up when it comes to pointing fingers at someone.”

Existing fingers were reserved for pointing at someone special, creating a need for an extra one.

Party insiders say that the party desperately needed an extra finger as its current five were always busy pointing at five fixed personalities – Delhi police commissioner BS Bassi, Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung, coward and psychopath Narendra Modi, rich Ambani, and rich Adani.

“Take for example the current odd-even experiment going on in Delhi,” AAP leader Gopal Rai explained, “We needed an extra finger to blame private schools.”

“Apart from such topical needs, we also need an extra finger to blame some sections of media, or some people on Twitter, or the local milkman, or anyone else as and when the need arises,” he added.

Sources say that Hrithik Roshan’s name was proposed and immediately accepted because the dashing actor recently charmed party supremo Arvind Kejriwal when he took an auto ride with his sons in Mumbai.

“Arvind turned emotional and recalled the time when he took an auto in Mumbai,” AAP leader Dr. Kumar Vishwas recalled the scenes from the party meeting that was called to select a brand ambassador, “Arvind immediately approved the appointment and also googled about the next movie of Hrithik that will release this year. He will review it on Twitter.”

Sources say that apart from an extra finger and his auto ride, the factor that worked in Hrithik’s favor was his stardom.

“When Hrithik, representing AAP, will make a fresh allegation and point a finger at someone, media will be forced to broadcast it live and keep running it whole day long. It will be just awesome!” a party leader said.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/happy-new-year-says-goiset-to-hire-new-cbi-ib-officers-to-meet-aap-needs-8711,"New Delhi: In a rather odd move, which aims to even out differences between Government of India and the Government of Kejriwal, Ministry of Rare Skills and Development has decided to induct fresh talent into CBI and IB to fulfil AAP’s demand for 10 CBI and IB officers. Understanding that none of our currentofficers are equipped to work withAAP government’s unique mindset, New Delhi has decided to recruit fresh faces required for the job.

CBI team to help DDCA probe

Government sources indicate that current officers in IB and CBI are used to working in secrecy as anonymity is of utmost importance in their current assignments. However, working with AAP would mean that that all investigations including surprise raids will be announced in advance for TV crews to be present for live coverage. As even the most elite cadre is not equipped to work under such challenging circumstances, recruiting fresh blood seems to be the only way out.

‘We cannot ignore the evolving political landscape. Investigations conducted under public eye is the change India has voted for’ said Mr. Sisodia heartily supporting this initiative.

As the recruitment process will also have to be tweaked a bit, GOI has requested services of legendary AAP member Raghu Ram, whose experience in conducting pressure interviews and recruiting the most passionate of people requires no introduction. Raghu has devised an ingenuous method for finding best people for the job. ‘This job requires people who can show disregard to established laws and are totally averse to applying any amount of common sense. We politely discourage people withhigh affinity for logical reasoning from applying to these positions. We are not looking for candidates whohave eye for details or theones trying to digout the facts in any given situation.We arelooking for highly motivated individuals, who can create their own facts and successfully convince people that their version is the only correct version, one who are able to draw conclusions without really bothering to get to the root of the issue’ said Raghuwith sincerity and conviction.

The new selection process will consist of a written round which will help filter out dimwits with high IQs, a rapid fire round where candidates will have to send out the maximum number of tweets in an hour, a debate round where aspirantsaccuse each other without giving supporting arguments and the final round will be a pressure interview with the honorable CM of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal. To maintain high levels of transparency, all rounds will be telecast live and winners will be decided based on SMS polls. (AAP reserves the right to ignore responses as deemed fit).

AAP refused to entertain queries when questioned by our Faking News team that such a process will expose identity of recruits and might hamper their investigations. ‘Only psychopaths and cowards are worried about reaching a conclusion’quipped an unnamed AAP source.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/specialchabbis-300x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/happy-new-year-says-goiset-to-hire-new-cbi-ib-officers-to-meet-aap-needs-8711,"Central government set to hire new CBI, IB officers to meet AAP needs",,1451716920.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/now-delhi-mlas-decide-to-give-up-400-pay-hike-to-continue-to-avail-lpg-subsidy-8703,"New Delhi: In a developing story the Delhi MLAs have decided to now give up the 400% hike in their salary so that they can continue to avail LPG subsidy. The central government earlier in the day disallowed availing of LPG subsidy to anyone who has a taxable income of above 10 lakh per annum.

The nation wants to know

With the 400% hike the salary of the Delhi lawmakers increased from Rs 88,000/- to Rs 2.10 lakh per month. The older salaries yielded an income of about Rs 10,56,00/- which can easily be deflated below 10 lakh with the help of any decent Chartered Accountant.

We spoke to one such AAP MLA hoping to find any sherd of logic behind this move, “Well when Modi ji announced that the eligibility to buy LPG subsidy will now be capped for those earning below 10 lakh, it blew my mind away. If the media or the Aam junta gets to know we are no longer availing LPG subsidies we won’t be Aam aadmis anymore and can kiss our political futures goodbye. I believe this subsidy cap was a conspiracy of Modi and Jaitley so that we would incurr a loss of 400%! Even my wife would have beaten me after she gets to that she has to pay Rs 300 extra for a cylinder. There’s no problem for Modi ji as food in his house is usually cooked for only about 10-15 days a year thanks to his foreign tours and he can effectively live out 5 years with just 1 LPG cylinder.”

We spoke to a prominent analyst for his move, “Now tell me does anyone in this country ever want to give up anything that is free or discounted? Now you see even Ambani would deflate his income to below 10 lakh to avail LPG subsidy. Now consider all the college kids who have I Phones and Mac book who still avail student consesions for travelling in trains or buses, and also consider the millionaires who fall under reserved status still using reservation even if they don’t need it. Do you think such move by the government will be effective ?”

Now it reported that Arvind Kejriwal will sit on a dharna against all his MLAs to protest against the hike rollback.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LPG-subsidy.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/now-delhi-mlas-decide-to-give-up-400-pay-hike-to-continue-to-avail-lpg-subsidy-8703,Now Delhi MLAs decide to give up 400% pay hike to continue to avail LPG subsidy,,1451388416.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Modi and Sharif discussing ‘surprise visits’

Faking News reporter spoke to a retired Pakistani military official who is believed to be close to ISI. He said, “We are outraged. Everywhere I see Mr Modi is getting applause for paying a surprise visit to our PM. But no one has ever acknowleged us for all the surprise visits our militants have paid to India over the years. Leave aside applauding, the Pakistani government has always denied our presence to the world. What’s even more disheartening is the fact that Sharif sahab hadn’t taken the permission of our army chief before meeting Modi. The intolerance in India is now slowly spreading to Pakistan. Thankfully we still have enough radicalised, deranged individuals who are ready to do the work. These surprise visits have been going on since 67 years to promote unification and peace between the two countries by making them into Akhand Pakistan.”

We spoke to another such leader who echoed the same views, “You were all cheering when Modi ji went with Sharif sahab in a Pakistani helicopter. But all our Militants who cross into Kashmir travel in an Indian jeep with your separatist leaders, I mean freedom fighters; they also visit their homes on their birthdays or when someone’s getting married in their house. Just like Modi ji is copying the UPA schemes he was also copying us when he made that surprise visit. Hope Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar protests against it.”

After Faking News Initially broke this story the whole Pakistani establishment has gone into denial mode by saying that these allegations are as unfounded as Dawood Ibrahim being in Pakistan and Osama Bin Laden ever living in Abbotabad and calling the two Militray heads quoted in our article as possible non state actors and/or RAW agents.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/modi-nawaz.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/now-pakistan-army-says-that-sending-militants-across-the-border-is-nothing-but-their-way-of-paying-surprise-visits-8699,Now Pakistan Army says that sending Militants across the border is nothing but their way of paying surprise visits,,1451289565.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The future of street lighting

After seeing the huge debate around India in the Paris climate summit, pollution has become a key talking point across India with various states taking actions on it. Car free days have started in places like Haryana and Delhi. Delhi will also implement the Odd Even Formula from 1st January to reduce pollution.

Bihar Government has also become serious about it and is thinking up various steps to combat pollution. First Tej Pratap Yadav suggested horse riding instead of using a car to reduce pollution as well as traffic and now he has targeted street lights.

Speaking to the media, Mr Yadav said, “Look at all the heat emitted by these street lights. One 400W street light is contributing thousands of Kilograms of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. Imagine the total CO2 emission across the state. We can remove all that by simple hanging jars full of Jugnoos (Fireflies) on poles.”

“This will help in job creation as well with the new industry of jugnoo-keeping along the lines of bee-keeping. We have also requested centre government’s help in funding this jugnoo-keeping industry. Right now they are wasting money with LED lighting when we have this free natural light of fireflies available with us.”, the health minister went on to add.

Meanwhile, Tej Pratap’s father and RJD supremo lalu Prasad Yadav isn’t very happy with this proposal. Reportedly, he has asked all street lights to be replaced by his election symbol Lantern.

As per sources, Mr Tej Pratap Yadav was earlier planning to place happydent eating people on top of the poles but that plan was shelved once they found out that there aren’t enough Biharis left in Bihar for all the poles in the state.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/x354-q80-300x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-riding-a-horse-instead-of-a-car-tej-pratap-yadav-to-replace-street-lights-with-jugnoo-to-reduce-pollution-8691,"After riding a horse instead of a car, Tej Pratap Yadav to replace street lights with jugnoo to reduce pollution",,1451111919.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

PM Modi giving assurances that guilty MP will be punished and Secret Santa will be held again

Sources say that chaotic scenes were witnessed after both ruling and opposition party MPs entered the well of the house and traded charges against each other.

Speaking to Faming News, Parliament speaker said, “We had kept all the secret santa gifts in the Parliament store house with post-it stuck to it having names of MPs. My suspicion was raised after an MP, who went for a bathroom break, did not return for a long time. I asked the house for his whereabouts. That’s when commotion was heard from the store room and it was reported that an MP was writing his own name on all the gifts.”

Apparently, there were complaints against the MP on previous occasions too.

Rakesh Sharma, who is in charge of a shelter for homeless kids said, “We had asked him to play the part of Santa Claus for homeless children and get them some gifts. But we realized that after he left our shelter, these were items missing from our office and the clothes and toys he got for the kids were also stolen.”

Home Minister Rajnath Singh condemned the act and said that at a time when Parliament has only seen ruckus and adjournments, such gift sharing among MPs will bring them together and also ensure that there is full attendance on at least a single day in the Parliament.

There is no news if any action will be initiated against the accused MP. “We were planning to suspend him for rest of the sessions. But that will work in his favor and anyway most session have been adjourned,” said Mallikarjun Kharge.

Meanwhile, Delihi CM Arvind Kejriwal once again used this opportunity to target both Congress and BJP.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/extreme-shortage-of-popcorn-and-soft-drinks-in-delhi-as-non-stop-aap-ddca-drama-continues-8679,"New Delhi: In breaking news, Ministry of Agriculture & Food has revealed that Delhi is facing acute shortage of Popcorn and Soft Drinks. The shortage is so extreme that government is seriously mulling to import popcorn and soft drinks from other Indian states and United States only for the city of Delhi.

Kejriwal-Jaitley drama giving Ekta Kapoor sleepless nights

Our reporter interviewed a source from the ministry to find out the real reasons. The source revealed that Delhi people were stockpiling popcorn & soft drinks after Arvind Kejriwal became CM for the first time in December, 2013.

After seeing ‘Kejriwal restoring illegal electrical connection which were cut’ to ‘Bachcho ki kasam. Na Congress ka support lenge aur na support denge slogan’ to ‘Bharti’s midnight raid in Khirki extension’ to ‘Dharna at Jantar Mantar’ to ‘his resignation’, Delhi people had figured out that entertainment quotient of AAP chief & his companions was very high which even Salman Khan’s and Govinda’s movies could not match.

After seeing this daily free entertainment by AAP, some Delhiites started stocking popcorn & soft drinks to enjoy this drama with their families every evening on news channels. After a tiring day of work, this free daily drama was the perfect remedy to freshen their moods up.

“After Kejriwal resigned and declared fight against Modi, we had noticed a brief jump in the sales of “Kachoris, Lassis and Thandais” in Varanasi. However, the sales quickly plummeted and things got better between May, 2014 to February, 2015. But after February 2015, sales of popcorn & soft drinks again picked up in Delhi. Things were not bad initially but from last few months, Delhiites have gone crazy buying them. The demand has grown exponentially & we are having a tough time maintaining the supplies,” source from the ministry revealed.

From the time of ‘Expelling Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav and using bouncers on them’ to ‘Farmer Gajendra Singh’s death in a rally’ to “Tomar’s fake degree” to ‘constant fight with LG’ to ‘calling Delhi police Thulla’ to ‘raising salaries of MLAs’ to ‘calling Modi a coward and psychopath’ to ‘targeting Arun Jaitley after CBI raid’, the AAP drama has been relentless.

Source also said, “You see citizens of Delhi are very smart people. They had figured out a smart way to get free entertainment. That’s the whole reason they elected AAP again, and not for free water or electricity. If they can get to watch the daily AAP drama from the comforts of their homes, why should they spend Rs. 300 per head to watch crappy movies and spend even more money on Popcorn and Soft drinks in theaters? Also, let’s not forget the hassle of driving to theaters on even & odd days now.”

Popular film critic Taran Adarsh has revealed that TRPs of Ekta Kapoor’s daily sops, reality shows and occupancy in Delhi theaters have steadily declined since Kejriwal became CM in February, 2015.

“Look, people of Delhi are just not bothered about going to theaters & watching the Saas-Bahu serials or reality shows on TV. They just put on any news channel & get the entertainment at their fingertips. And now Kejriwal is even providing them film reviews on twitter. What more can they ask for?” he said.

Meanwhile, following this acute shortage, Government of India has decided to invoke “Essential Commodities Act” which will apply to popcorn and soft drinks just like onions.

Delhi Theater Owners’ Association has also released a memo asking theaters to ration popcorn and soft drinks where only one small bag of popcorn & one small glass of soft drink will be provided per one theater row. If they runout, then people will be provided with “Bhelpuri and Jaljeera” as backup food items included in ticket price.

When our reporter asked Ashutosh from AAP about the shortage, he ‘twitted’ saying, “Shortage of popcorn and soft drinks in Delhi. Will the Modi govt. answer?”

Not getting any answer from him, our reporter then asked Kejriwal. He said, “Yehi to scam hai ji. Give me control of Delhi police & see what I can do.”

When reminded that this shortage is actually due to AAP drama, Kejriwal declared, “Modiji can’t even solve a small issue of popcorn and soft drink shortage in Delhi. Aur desh kya chalayenge? We ask Modiji to resign and face our internal lokpal.”

The toll naka that witnessed the end of a political career

On another pollution filled Monday morning, Ram Kumar Bhaiyya was manning the lane 4 at Dahisar Toll Naka on the outer limits of Mumbai when he received the shock of his life.

A red and white Pajero, which had a huge logo and flag of a political party (known for promoting Pakistan tourism by asking some people to go to Pakistan and doling out rewards for slapping people), pulled in his lane.

As Ram was pulling his hand back and readying to let the car pass, the car windows rolled down and he was handed a crisp note of Rs.50. Ram fumbled as he handed back the change to the car driver. This can be clearly seen on the CCTV footage which is in the possession of Faking News.

This incident came to the note of the party’s local unit chief, Gaitonde bhau, when it’s CCTV footage was shown in acclaimed shows like – Worlds Most Extreme – India and Believe It or Not.

Mr. Gaitonde, while burning the car owner’s membership receipt shouted at the top of his lungs about how this incident was a bolt on their rich legacy. He kept on shouting about how this toll naka was a loot scheme, achhe din were a smokescreen, toll was against Indian culture, conspiracy by Facebook on sending more Pirate Kings request than Candy Crush, red Starbucks glasses were an eye sore etc.

It must be noted that the State Government has specified some categories and types of vehicles which are not supposed to pay toll tax. However, the toll naka attendants have developed a mental chart of which vehicles are supposed to be ‘exempted’:

State Buses, Auto, Bikes, Ambulances, Police Cars etc. Obviously, Don’t Stop Pajeros, Monteros, Fortuners, XUV 500, Tata Safari(who the f*** still drives it?) and every other SUV which Rohit Shetty has blown up in his films Never Stop Landcruiser (added to this list after 2002) Never Stop and never stand/sit/sleep on the footpath while the car passes by. Cars with Local Political Parties flag (including Nano) Never Ever Stop unless you want red cheeks and/or be reminded of your mother and sister.

Raju Jaiprakash, a veteran of 5 toll protests, 2 toll naka vandalism,42 slaps, and innumerable abuses; shares his experience, “When I joined this naka about a year and a half ago, I was told to rottofy this chart and live by it. But forgetting this chart has its own benefits – people immediately recognise your state and its contribution to Maharashtra.”

Reportedly, the aforementioned chart has inspired a few games as well, which the toll naka attendants play among themselves. One of them is – Stop It To Win It wherein you try and stop more than 5 cars (falling in the above category) successively and the one who receives no slaps or abuses, wins. Till date, no one has been able to win this game and the expectation of someone winning it is as low as Bhai fans using logic. Therefore, the winning prize is not yet specified.

This incident has sent shock-waves among the toll paying community who have started an online petition to compel the producers of Believe It or Not and other such shows; to not showcase such footage on their show, fearing backlash from other political parties.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/toll-naka-300x182.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-party-revokes-membership-after-pajero-owner-pays-toll-charges-8678,Political party revokes membership after Pajero owner pays toll charges,,1450778075.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

PM Modi checking the coin in his pocket for the Coin Toss session

Speaker today announced that instead of a regular session, the Parliament will have a special ‘Coin Toss session’

Speaking to Faking News a senior BJP MP said, “The way opposition parties are behaving, I don’t think we can get any work done in winter session. So we have are planning to toss coin in the Parliament and then accept or reject bills in a single go. A special session is scheduled tomorrow and luckily since PM Modi is also in the country, we are hoping that the will start the session by the first coin toss by the PM himself.”

“I think we are entering a new era of Parliamentary discussions where time is of essence and such innovative practices are the need of the hour,” said Speaker of the Parliament as he gave the green signal for the coin to be flipped.

Our sources who were present in the Parliament said that PM Modi tossed the coin up and no sooner it started falling, Rahul Gandhi screamed saying ‘Rupee is falling, the economy is in bad shape. PM must answer. PM must resign’. And there was ruckus in the Parliament once again.

APP leader Kejriwal too jumped on a chance to criticize the government. “So much black lying outside the country and Modiji is tossing coins. I request Modiji to get all the coins that are lying in swiss bank accounts first,” he said while simultaneously replying to Ashutosh’s query on the number of zeros in 10 Cr.

Following the chaos, Speaker decided to adjourn the Parliament for another 2 hours

Meanwhile, Arnab Goswami thundered at the way Parliament functioned when it came to discussion on crucial bills and criticized MPs for the ‘coin toss’ session.

“It is the same story every session. Like every Shahrukh Khan movie, our Parliament too has nothing new to offer. Sambit Patra, I am asking today, is this a cricket match that you will toss the coin and make decisions. I want you to apologize to the people of the country,” screamed Mr. Goswami as Sambit Patra was seen stuffing his ears with cotton.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/modi-speaker-parliament1_0_0_0-300x181.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/six-bills-to-be-passed-in-remaining-days-of-winter-session-govt-to-toss-coin-and-decide-8677,"Six bills to be passed in remaining days of winter session, Govt. to toss coin and decide",,1450776129.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Azad’s nephew (Name withheld for safety reasons) has thanked his uncle for blaming hackers for the tweet in question and not his nephew, as is the standard practice.

Kirti Azad feeling happy after blaming the hackers

Late last night, Kirti Azad tweeted that many agencies have asked him to take precaution against threat to his life. He later tagged Arun Jaitley in the tweet and said that he isn’t afraid of napunsaks. However, he issued a clarification shortly after that his account was hacked and he didn’t tweet that.

Speaking to Faking News, an elated Kirti Azad’s nephew said, “I really can’t tell you how relieved I am. When I saw the tweet calling Mr Jaitley a napunsak from his handle, I knew the blame is going to fall on me. Ever since Raina brought nephews to mainstream, we are the bali ka bakra for every offensive tweet, sometimes for scams too. Thankfully, my panic was shortlived. Within half an hour, he put the blame squarely on hackers.”

When we asked him whether he believes his uncle’s version of account hacking, the newphew laughed and said, “Who will hack my uncle’s account yaar. Nobody even paid attention to his rants on DDCA for years till Kejriwal brought media attention with him. Politics is all about making false promises and blaming others when you screw things up. It was obvious he was going to blame his act on someone, luckily, he blamed it on the hackers.”

Meanwhile, as per sources, nobody in BJP is buying the hacking theory since the tweet in question was still not deleted when reports last came in. Senior BJP leadership has even asked Javed Akhtar to delete Kirti Azad’s tweet looking at his expertise in deleting others tweets.

In related news, Arvind Kejriwal has offered AAP membership to Kirti Azad after getting impressed with his skill of blaming others for his own act.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kirti-Azad-300x199.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kirti-azads-nephew-thanks-his-uncle-for-blaming-the-hacker-8676,Kirti Azad's nephew thanks his uncle for blaming the hacker,,1450763449.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Arun Jaitley with folded hands requesting Kejriwal to stop cracking any more jokes

While speaking to the media at a press conference, the AAP leader said, “After thousand tweets and countless media briefings I have absolutely no doubt that the CBI is convinced and is now under our control. Soon the truth about the case will be in public and Jaitleyji also knows that. I have come to know from my sources that he (Arun Jaitley) will wear the santa outfit and move around Delhi to give CBI the slip. He is also planning to move all documents and incriminating evidence in the santa bag, so that no one suspects.”

AAP leaders have also said that they are not going to be fooled by this ‘fancy dress’. Apparently, AAP volunteers will be out on the streets in an attempt to catch the FM red handed.

Party member Kumar Vishwas said, “If Mr. Jaitley can dress up as Santa, hum bhi kuch kam nahi. Most AAP members will be patrolling the streets, especially on Christmas Eve. I am planning to dress up like Cindrella and Ashutosh as Batman. We won’t let Mr. Jaitley get away so easily.”

BJP has called Arvind Kejriwal’s statement as blasphemous, preposterous, sacrilege, farcical and similar other words that need a quick glance at the dictionary.

“Arvind Kejriwal is getting hysterical. Our party will strongly protest against his statement that Mr. Arun Jaitley will be dressing as Santa. I mean, does he even look like a Santa. If Mr. Kejriwal has said something similar about Amit Shah or Nitin Gadkari, we would not have escalated the issue, but the Delhi CM definitely needs to get his eyes checked put an end to this Comic Con,” said Sambit Patra, spokesperson for BJP.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Jaitley-smile-PTI-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arun-jaitley-planning-to-dress-up-as-santa-claus-to-avoid-cbi-kejriwal-8666,Arun Jaitley planning to dress up as Santa Claus to avoid CBI: Kejriwal,,1450433586.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Cancel your flight tickets if you plan to travel on 18th December 2015

The CEO of Flying Monkey airlines that is well renowned for offering air travel in INR 99 (excluding everything) spoke to faking news that, “We respect Rohit Shetty’s talent. He makes up for the shortcomings in the story by making his cars achieve unimaginable altitudes. When his last movie was released our flight no. Airbus 420 headed towards Jhumari Talliya avoided collision with one of his flying Scorpio car at 35000 altitiude. This time as it is SRK movie car may go still higher and so we are not taking any chances. After the film is released and altitude and trajectory of each of his flying car is calculated and mapped then only we will resume our operations. Meanwhile we will sell tickets for INR 9 to many remote destinations for the year 2098.”

One stuntman from Rohit Shetty’s team revealed that this time they have fitted the cars with altimeters so after the first show of the movie they are going to send the altitude data for each of the flying cars ISRO and all the airline companies so they can manage their operations accordingly.

One of the award returnees defended the flying cars by saying, “Look the parking has become so intolerant that cars cannot stay and have to fly. I will definitely return my ‘Moron of the year award’.”Whereas one Delhi resident is confused about the odd- even rule as whether it is applicable to travelling cars on road or applicable to flying cars as well.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwals-office-washroom-choked-plumber-traces-the-choke-to-pms-office-8661,"New Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal was furious when he found the toilet he is using was choked. He suspected PMO has something to do with this.

Kejriwal showing signs of relief after the choke was cleared and he could finally use the washroom

Most of the leading media houses ignored this piece of news as they wanted to maintain their ‘integrity’. They knew this is something their journalists cannot access and verify.

According to our sources Arvind Kejriwal has proved once again that he is right. The Aam plumber which came on short notice after getting a call from Delhi secretariat found the choke in CM’s room has actually originated from PM’s room.

The Aam plumber (who did not want to be named) told us, “Sir, I am doing maintenance work in Delhi secretariat for last twenty years, never seen such a major choke. CM’s room has a dedicated line as we cannot mix CM’s line with any other line coming from other ministers or bureaucrats room. Similarly my colleague working on PMO also confirmed PM’s room has separate connection. All these VVIPs connections are connected in such a way that regular maintenance is easy. These VVIP connections are covered under a separate tender so that it can be awarded to one company so that its maintenance remains hassle free and quick.”

Aam plumber added, “Unlike us, VVIPs cannot use other’s washroom due to security reasons. No we have technology to find out where is the root cause of the choke. Within a minute I could trace that choke has started from PM’s room which is just 7 kilometer away. My guess this choke might have started sometime back, as PM is not using it regularly due to his frequent on-site trips, he might not have noticed it.”

The aam plumber said, “I have never seen Kejriwal sir so angry. Not only he called PM psychopath, after finding the reason behind the choke he called PM is anti-naturopath. He is taking naturopathy medicines to keep his body and mind clean and for that he visits the washroom frequently. Today he had to block everything for hours.”

“I have seen he will wash his hand after every tweet and will tell Manishji loudly ‘I have washed my hand off this tweet’. Today for a change he did series of tweets without taking a break when I was doing my duty,” he added.

“I do my job honestly so that my boss remains happy all the time. He has assured me a 400% hike from next year. Now I am checking if I can separate out PM’s line from our CM’s line. Last year CM’s line was separated from Lieutenant Governor’s office room line,” aam plumber said, hoping to get a salary hike.

“Another point to note unlike other VVIPs, our CM allows aam public like Kumar Vishwasji to use his washroom. As Kumarji is neither an MLA nor MP right now, sir allows him to use whenever he visits him and also whenever sir will go out of station he will give the key to Kumarji. I have seen Kumarji will sit inside for hours to write his Kavita,” concluded the aam plumber.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejri-releif.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwals-office-washroom-choked-plumber-traces-the-choke-to-pms-office-8661,"Kejriwal’s office washroom choked, plumber traces the choke to PM’s office",,1450335637.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Arvind Kejriwal asking the CBI to do a small favor and give intimation before conducting raids

He further cautioned all national security agencies to not dare to raid AAP controlled territories without 2 week prior notice and mandatory permission from Kejriwal himself.

Addressing media persons after a dharna rally he angrily questioned, “Yaar ye CBI waale hote kaun hai? Who are they to do that? What jurisdiction do they have in AAP ruled territories? In AAP’s controlled lands AAP is Judge, AAP is Jury and AAP is jallaad. They should understand AAP’s internal laws. Any government does not have any right to interfere in AAP’s internal legal processes. AAP’s internal lokpal’s decision would be full and final in AAP ruled territories.”

Pointing fingers towards camera Kejriwal again fumed in anger, “Going forward AAP should be served atleast a two weeks prior notice before any national security agency even tries to set foot within 100 meters of any AAP controlled territories. If anyone is guilty in our lands we will tackle with them ourselves by our own rule of law. If we find someone innocent no other authority dare challenge us …. Laal Salaam.”

Kejriwal then left the venue in jiffy after which some of the supporters tried to burn CBI effigy, but since the effigy was doused in too much kerosene it burnt violently and clothes of some of the supporters also caught fire. No one however was reported hurt except Mr. Kejriwal’s ego.

Meanwhile, some less aggressive AAP members suggested that the party launch an app for CBI officials that will enable them to give intimation before conducting raids. “We don’t believe in just criticizing, but we are offering solution too. Our party will officially launch its app for that will benefit both the CBI and those who are under the scanner,” said a senior AAP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejriwal-cbi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/security-agencies-must-provide-2-week-prior-notice-before-raiding-aap-controlled-territories-kejriwal-8659,Security agencies must provide 2 week prior notice before raiding AAP controlled territories: Kejriwal,,1450255351.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Our party was celebrating the Bihar poll victory when this man came up on the stage and pulled me towards him and then hugged me. I can tell you I had no clue who this man was till today, when I saw that CBI officials had raided the secretariat.”

The Lalu-Kejriwal hug

CBI officials revealed that they are closely scrutinizing all that they have managed to gather from the raid and the image of Kejriwal and Lalu hug will be on the radar.

Rabri Devi too remembers the incident and said, “Yes, it’s true. I have seen this man walk up on stage and then suddenly without warning he pulled Laluji and hugged him. “Itni himmat toh laluji me bhi nahi hai, aaj tak unhone bhi mujhe iss tarah se kheech ke gale nahi lagaya.”

Sources close to Lalu Yadav say that the RJD Chief wants to ‘stay away from CBI’ and all such controversies that may even remotely tarnish the political career of his sons.

Apparently, he has sent a bouquet to PM Modi too and indirectly apologized for calling him ‘shaitaan’. “Name calling during election is common. You must have heard names likes shaitaan, chudail, bhrampishach etc being traded. But there is nothing personal and Laluji has respect for the PM,” said Tejasvi Yadav.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal who is rattled with the CBI raid, has cancelled all plans for the weekend.

“Arvindji was to attend the first day first show of SRK-Kajol starrer Dilwale. He had seen DDLJ with bhabhiji atleast 10 times when he was studying at IIT Delhi.

“Modi is scared of us and is engaging in such cheap tricks. The coward psychopath has planted such objectionable documents in my office,” Delhi CM Kejriwal declared when Faking News asked about CBI’s findings.

“Am I stupid to keep such documents in my office?” Kejriwal argued when asked about the documents recovered from this office.

When our reporter reminded him that these could be the same set of documents he had claimed to be possessing when he was an anti-corruption crusader who was not forcibly hugged by Lalu, Kejriwal claimed that there was an undeclared emergency in the country and Modi must be removed.

“I know what documents and files are in my office, and Modi is playing cheap tricks,” he later clarified, “Today it is documents against Sheila Dixit, tomorrow they will plant documents against Sonia Gandhi ji in National Herald case. Is this what people of this country want?”

Realizing that he has taken the name of Sonia Gandhi and National Herald in the same sentence, Kejriwal quickly added, “This government is more corrupt than any other government India had seen.” Soon after this, #CorruptModi was trending in India.

With Twitter trends threatening to disrupt parliament, CBI clarified that it had not raided the CM’s office but the office of his chief secretary, which is located in the same premises. “We found these documents in a dustbin outside the Chief Minister’s office,” a CBI officer claimed.

“Why is CBI looking into dustbins? Is this Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan? Will dustbins be emptied and garbage strewn around in the name of fighting corruption?

The place where Young India wants to be

As per the report, sarkari jobs which were till now looked down by many, are now ranked top preferred by most looking for professional qualification, especially being an MP.

The report says that the ‘No Work All Pay’ culture has attracted a lot of young Indian’s who don’t want to succumb to endless work pressure and would like to enjoy life instead.

Raunak Singh who works for an IT company in Bangalore and till few days back was planning to pursue MBA, has thrown away his CAT preparation books and is now devoting himself completely to politics spoke to our reporter and said, “As part of my current job in IT industry, I end up working for 14 hours every day. Not to mention the extra work I do on weekends and promotion chances are looking bleak this year too. I thought getting an MBA will change all that and probably help me command a higher pay.”

“But it seem like every Neil Nitin Mukesh is an MBA these days. Besides, look how much fun our MPs are having. All they do is scream in the Parliament and adjourn it, no attendance compulsory, weekends off, subsidized canteen food, no appraisal but still hike in salary. That too without having to slog for getting a professional degree,” he said even as he tied bundles of MBA preparation material, ready to be given to the raddiwala.

Report also elaborates on how CAT, the most popular competitive exam amongst college graduates has already lost its sheen. IIMs too have reported a drop in number of students. “There was a time a time when OB vans used to be parked outside CAT exam venues on last Sunday of every November. Just appearing the exam made you a half MBA, all that is gone now,” said an IIM aspirant, who has been trying to crack the exam for the last 10 years.

If Salman’s driver can do it, why cant’t my driver

Speaking at a national meet of the Congress party today, Ms. Gandhi said that Tadapit Kumar, Rahul and her driver of fifteen years, was the actual investor in National Herald and not the Gandhis.

“I want to confirm today that it was our driver, Tadapit-ji, who had given the Rs. 90 Crore loan to acquire a controlling stake in National Herald,” Mrs. Gandhi said, amid cheers and applause from the crowd of Congress party-men at the meet.”

“Tadapit-ji did so without informing Rahul or me, and his only mistake was that he happened to once share a cigarette with Mr. Subramanian Swamy’s driver, post which Mr. Swamy started falsely implicating us in this case,” she said.

“It is the intolerance of the Narendra Modi government that they are targeting innocent people like us, whose drivers happened to innocently invest 90 Crores in a company,” she continued.

Faking News in-house news analyst pointed out at the increasing number of instances where Drivers are ‘taking over’ the blame from their owners since Salman Khan was acquitted by the court.

Apparently, a few enterprising individuals have teamed up with these ‘happy to be fall guy’ drivers to start their own online blame taking venture. “It’s a lucrative market out there. So many cases and you know how the judiciary functions. By the time a criminal is convicted he is almost ready to die a natural death,” said a serial entrepreneur.

Meanwhile, Narayansamy spoke all out in support of the Gandhi family giving them a clean chit even before they appeared before the court. “It is a well known fact that ‘Rahul can do no wrong’. This is just another ploy by our opposition to tarnish the image of Rahulji,” said Narayansamy, with his hands still unwashed since the time he picked up Rahul Gandhi’s footwear.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/soniag.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/driver-invested-in-national-herald-without-telling-us-sonia-gandhi-8649,Driver invested in National Herald without telling us: Sonia Gandhi,,1449982387.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Now get ready to see similar protest in court too

We won’t let the court function if it gives verdict against our leaders. We have successfully blocked both houses of parliament while having only 44 MP. What makes you think we can’t do the same to judiciary? Congress also accused high court of pursuing Legal Vendetta against Gandhis.

Why is court adamant on Gandhis being personally present during the proceedings? This is pure arrogance. If judges really want to see Sonia ji or Rahul ji, they can take the appointment and visit 10 Janpath, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said while checking Rahul Gandhi’s holiday calendar.

Shaitaan Khopdi™ tried to reason with Kharge by saying, ‘In a democracy, court is the supreme authority’. But Kharge was ready with the answer, ‘There should be reasonable restriction on judiciary’s adventurism. When it’s about Gandhi family, courts and democracy can wait. That has been the tradition since 1975. But during last 18 months old traditions have been thrown in the dustbin. Why so much arrogance and intolerance is being directed towards Congress?’

Reacting to the situation Rahul Gandhi said, “Justice is in my shirt, in my pant. In fact it used to be in my pocket till May 2014. We used to appoint judges on the cases related to us. This ‘Suit-Boot ki Sarkar’ is snatching everything away from people like us”.

When asked about his involvement in National Herald case, Gandhi replied, “We tried to revive a media house which was struggling to stay afloat. Is it something new we have done? So many media houses are surviving only because of our money. But why court is taking special interest in this case? That’s why I call it Politics of Vendetta.”

All this while national mainstream media was struggling to find news they can carry in order to avoid reporting on National Herald.

With no hearing lined up for either Indrani Mukharjea or IPL spot fixing cases it looked like they may have to betray Congress. But thankfully #SalmanVerdict arrived just in time leading to a big sigh of relief in news rooms and in 10 Janpath.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-mlas-propose-corruption-temptation-resistance-allowance-for-legislators-8644,"New Delhi: A group of Delhi MLAs from the Aam Aadmi Party, have suggested the creation of a new ‘corruption temptation resistance allowance’ (CTR allowance) to be given as part of the monthly salary of Delhi legislators.

Kejriwal lost in his own thoughts on ‘Corruption Temptation Resistance Allowance

They feel that the temptation to get involved in corruption is too high, given the position of power that they are in.

Speaking exclusively to faking news, Shri Praveen Kumar, AAP MLA from Jangpura, who was also part of the group that proposed the revolutionary 400% salary hike back in July 2015 said, “We are regularly meeting with industrialists, mediapersons, and others who are always willing to pay bribes for certain decisions. Until now we have clearly said no to such things. This has only been possible because of the high standards of AAP. But we are almost always in a situation where our minds and character can slip. Hence we feel that this is a very important step forward.”

He is part of the group of MLAs who has made this proposal.

On being asked for a comment, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of Delhi, had this to say, “I think this is a very novel idea to end the scourge of corruption. This was our promise and we will achieve the death of corruption at all costs. If after this also, any minister indulges in corruption then we will throw them out.”

He also added, “I think Mr. Modi also should get CTR allowance. When he meets Obamaji, he must be feeling embarrassed to admit that he never takes bribes unlike all other politicians.”

He was speaking on the sidelines of a function to felicitate Shri Praveen Kumar in the Jangpura mohalla sabha by its residents, for the hard work done by Shri Kumar.

Shri Kejriwal was invited as chief guest. When he was asked by a journalist on what he had to say on being caught napping in the assembly, he dismissed this accusation saying he was just meditating and trying to focus inward, after which he was able to concentrate completely on the proceedings of the Assembly.

On being questioned, whether there was any plan to hold a referendum on this issue, Kejriwal explained, “No there is no need for a referendum on this since I know the rhythm of the heartbeat of our people very well, I know the warmth of their every breath. I am familiar with the exact shade of redness of the blood that runs in their veins. When I was meditating for a couple of minutes in the assembly yesterday, I realized that we have the support of the entire population of Delhi and I am truly overwhelmed by their support”.

There was a hint of moistness in Shri Kejriwal’s eyes. The members of the press did not have any further questions to ask him.

The Assembly Speaker Shri Ram Nivas Goel has referred this proposal to an independent 3-member committee involving prominent persons of the citizenry of Delhi, with one retired judge of Delhi High Court and one person from the media.

The Chief Whip of Government of Delhi said that he was proud to be an AAP member today. “With respect to the CTR allowance proposal, my party unanimously requested Hon’ble Speaker to leave the matter entirely to a Committee of Experts to be constituted with outsiders as its Members. Hon’ble Speaker Shri Ram Niwas Goel accepted the request. Delhi is showing the way. For the second time in the history of independent India, I can proudly claim, the Delhi Assembly made this pioneering move aimed at restoring the credibility of elected representatives. It has voluntarily given up the constitutional and statutory privilege of fixing the salaries of MLAs on its own. I am sure and I hope it will inspire all the right thinking people to adopt course correction across the country. I congratulate the Chief Minister and the Delhi Government.”

Shri Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister, said while speaking on this bill in the Assembly, “This is a revolutionary bill which will end corruption once and for all. After this no sitting minister should have any hesitation in saying no to bribes. We propose a CTR allowance which will be 400% of the current gross salary of a member of legislature. This is very much needed to serve the people of this great city of Delhi more efficiently. We cannot deny the need for money when it comes to serving the people.”

“Currently we are not able to attend public gatherings like weddings and ribbon cutting ceremonies, for the fear of being tempted to accept bribes. Especially when we have visitors at home, I feel severly pressurized by my wife who keeps saying ‘Lelo, tumhara kya jaega? leke mujhe dedo, koi guilt feeling bhi nahi hogi tumhe’. This is an attempt to create an environment for the MLAs, in which they do not have to look for an alternative source of income,” added Shri Praveen Kumar.

Another MLA who did not wish to be named said “kya kare sir, sab log toh Kejriwal nahi bansakte hain na, chai pani ke liye kuch to karna padega.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejri1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-mlas-propose-corruption-temptation-resistance-allowance-for-legislators-8644,Delhi MLAs propose 'Corruption Temptation Resistance Allowance' for legislators,,1449734775.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/louisiana-governor-bobby-jindal-to-join-aap-8585,"New Delhi: After pulling out of the 2016 presidential race, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said that he is all set to get back to his roots.

Meet AAP’s newest member, Bobby Jindal

Speaking to Faking News he said, “I realized that it isn’t really my time and by opting out of the 2016 presidential race I had just taken a u-turn. I am a Punjabi, felt like going back to India and being with ‘my people’. There couldn’t have been a better party than AAP for me to further my political ambition.”

Sources close to Bobby Jindal say that the ex-President hopeful has been feeling ‘home sick’ for quite some time and many saw his latest move coming. “He has been behaving a little weird lately. A few days back he was singing ‘chitti aayi hai’ at Times Square. The cops took him aside for questioning and only when he said that he was the Governor, did they let him off with a warning.”

AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal has welcomed Bobby Jindal’s decision to join the party and said, “So many people have left the party in the last few years that we were desperate for someone to join us. Arre Bobby Jindal kya, Agar Bobby Darling bhi hota toh hum usko party mein include karte.”

It is not clear when the formal announcement of Mr. Jindal’s induction will be made by the party but the spokesperson for the party says that its ‘work in progress’.

“We have asked Bobby Jindal to complete the joining formalities like submitting his last drawn salary slip, his original school and college leaving certificates. Once the documents are verified we will make a formal announcement,” said Raghav Chaddha, spokesperson for the party.

Meanwhile, some party members opposed Bobby Jindals inclusion in the party. “Ek party mein do Kumar Vishwas nahi ho sakte. Kitna confusion ho jata hai,” said a member of the party referring to the uncanny resemblance between Bobby Jindal and Kumar Vishwas.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bobby-jindal-aap-300x162.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/louisiana-governor-bobby-jindal-to-join-aap-8585,Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to join AAP,,1447839301.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ms-aiyar-to-pak-remove-dhoni-make-me-captain-to-win-in-world-cup-8584,"Islamabad. Former union minister and Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today stoked another controversy by reportedly saying, during a panel discussion on a Pakistani sports channel that MS Dhoni needs to be removed as Indian Cricket captain for Pakistan to beat India in a World Cup.

Pakistan has never managed to beat India in an ODI World cup in 6 attempts and it remains one of their major ambitions to beat India in a world cup game. Closest they came was in 2011 semifinal but then India was rescued by Misbah Ul Haq’s aggressive batting.

MS Aiyar thinking about his opening combination

When the anchor of Pakistani sports channel asked what is to be done to end this string of losses against India in the World Cup, Aiyar responded, “The first and the foremost thing is to remove Dhoni. Only then can the chances of a Pakistan win increase. We have to wait for four more years. You are all optimistic that Dhoni will retire by then but there has to be a more proactive approach than that.” He further said, “Bring me to the leadership and remove him. There is no other way to increase your chances. I will drop Virat, send Raina to face Mohammad Irfan, include Binny as the allrounder and will bowl Ishant Sharma at the death.”

When we sought his reaction to the issue, MS Dhoni said, “This is absolutely heartbreaking. After all that I have done for Chennai and Tamil Nadu, a Tamil guy approaching Pakistan to remove me is quite sad. At least he should have approached Sri Lanka.”

The matter has taken a political turn with BJP asking Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to clear their stand. In response, Congress has distanced itself from MS Aiyar’s remark and also shown footage of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi cheering for India during the aforementioned 2011 semifinal to clear any doubt.

Meanwhile, Subramanian Swamy was spotted going through the list of companies registered in England to check MS Aiyar’s nationality.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mani-Shankar-Aiyar-300x216.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ms-aiyar-to-pak-remove-dhoni-make-me-captain-to-win-in-world-cup-8584,"MS Aiyar to Pak- Remove Dhoni, Make me captain to win in World Cup",,1447834465.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/swamy-challenges-rahul-to-go-without-tea-for-24-hrs-to-prove-he-isnt-british-8579,"After levelling serious allegations against Rahul Gandhi over his nationality, Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has thrown a fresh challenge to Rahul Gandhi to prove he isn’t British.

Speaking to the media in Delhi, Mr Swamy challenged Rahul Gandhi to survive 24 hrs without having a single cup of tea in order to prove he isn’t a British national.

Can he resist this temptation?

Earlier on Monday, Mr Swamy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has claimed himself to be a British national before the authorities there and has demanded that he be stripped of Indian citizenship and Lok Sabha membership.

While Congress has rubbished these allegations, Mr Swamy says that burden of proof now lies with Rahul Gandhi and he must prove he is not a British citizen. Easiest way to do it is by going without tea for 24 hours.

Tea is widely considered to be the national love interest of Britain and an average Brit drinks about 3 and a half cups of tea every day. Dr Swamy argued that if he is British, he won’t be able to resist it for that long.

Speaking to the press, Mr Swamy said, “I have already given papers proving Rahul Gandhi is British. Now he must show that he isn’t a Brit by staying away from tea. However, this doesn’t mean that we accept him as an Indian citizen. For that, he will have to pee on the roadside and throw garbage out of his moving car.”

As per our sources inside BJP, BJP has already prepared a grand strategy to foil Rahul Gandhi’s tea fast if he accepts the challenge. A NaMo tea stall has already opened outside Rahul Gandhi’s residence at Tughlak lane. There are also plans to invite him to a Chai pe charcha with the Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi to debate national issues. If Mr Gandhi turns down this invite, BJP plans to celebrate it as a moral victory and if he accepts, his British citizenship may get confirmed.

Meanwhile, Mr MS Aiyar responded to Mr Swamy’s challenge by saying, “These chaiwallahs can’t think beyond tea. I told you a chaiwallah shouldn’t become the PM.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rahul-gandhi-kedarnath-trek-having-tea_650x400_71429870327-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/swamy-challenges-rahul-to-go-without-tea-for-24-hrs-to-prove-he-isnt-british-8579,Swamy challenges Rahul to go without tea for 24 hrs to prove he isn’t British,,1447748178.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/inspired-by-modi-events-congress-to-conduct-rahul-gandhi-live-in-bangkok-stadium-8575,"New Delhi: Upon the advice of party senior Digvijay Singh, Congress party has decided to conduct a Modi-like event for its Vice-President Rahul Gandhi as part of its preparation for 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

A fan’s representation of the upcoming Rahul Gandhi live

An honest revelation from the senior leader confirmed that idea of ‘Rahul Gandhi Live’ was an inspiration drawn from prime minister’s recent speech at Wembley stadium in the United Kingdom.

Venue of the live event was supposedly decided based on Rahul’s choice. As per sources, Digvijay is believed to have instructed party’s event management team to book Bangkok’s Rajamangala stadium for the event.

Speaking to Faking News, Digvijay said, “Rahul ji has a huge task of carrying the flag of anti-incumbency while leading from the front for 2019 elections. We have chosen Bangkok for his inaugural speech so that he gets the much needed relaxation before his discourse.”

Meanwhile, noted journalist Sagarita Gose seemed quite happy with Congress’ move and she said, “Whatever it maybe for Congress, it is going to be a juxtaposing exercise for me, yet again! Will be happy to analyze the event and give my expert opinion on it.”

While we were leaving, we heard Rahul practicing his speech which gave us a feeling that “RaGa Live” was around the corner. Here’s what we could interpret from his moments of soliloquy.

“The color of coconut from inside is the color of dress we wear. As Congress party, we are free and fair in all our aspects. The towel used in massage parlor is white too. This is where we see a unison of our cultures,” said Rahul as he stared at himself in the party office mirror.

As per our sources, the great stand-up comedian Russel Peters has been feeling insecure from the time ‘RaGa Live’ was announced as it may push him down to world number two spot.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/raga-event-300x246.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/inspired-by-modi-events-congress-to-conduct-rahul-gandhi-live-in-bangkok-stadium-8575,"Inspired by Modi events, Congress to conduct 'Rahul Gandhi Live' in Bangkok stadium",,1447658359.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

According to our sources that provide regular information to Faking News, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been to Baker street on Friday morning to hire famous detective Sherlock Holmes to help him in finding ‘Modi wave’ which he apparently lost recently.

We exclusively present you the highlights of the conversation that happened between Modi, Sherlock and Sherlock’s closest friend Dr Watson.

——– Below is the selected transcript, as it happened in 221B Baker Street (Sherlock’s residence) at 6:07 AM (local time) on Friday: ——–

Modi: Hello Sherlock, let me introduce my self, I am…

SH (Sherlock Holmes): Wait.. Wait.. Let me guess who you are. Based on your shoes and time on your watch, I reckon you came from India. In fact, it is North India, looking at your attire. And, as I could see a lot of people waiting for your autographs outside, you must be a popular figure in India. Oh yes, you are in politics! Politics and Popular… You must be none other than Nitish Kumar! Welcome Mr Kumar, How can I help you?

Finding out the Modi Wave

Modi: Grrrrrr!! (angrily)

Watson: Sherlock, It’s not Nitish, This is Mr Modi.

SH: Oh.. yes of course! Welcome Mr Modi. Let me guess why you are here. It is Cricket, isn’t it? You were involved in some cricket related scam, fighting with the BCCI, and some controversy related to a foreign travel too?

Watson: Sherlock.. No!! You got it wrong again. This is Narendra Modi, not Lalit Modi. He is India’s Prime Minister.

SH: Oh..yes of course. Welcome Mr Modi!

SH (murmuring in Watson’s ear): How did you know this (about Modi’s identity) Watson??

Watson (murmuring back): From Newspaper, besides, he has our appointment.

SH: Okay, Mr Modi, How can I help you?

Modi: Hmm.. I came here to report a lost property and I need your help in finding it.

SH: Oh, can you please explain in detail?

Modi: okay.. Mitron.. I used to have a property called ‘Modi Wave’ with me. I loved it. It gave me many benefits. But, I don’t know how, I lost it one day.

SH: ‘Modi Wave’.. Hmm interesting. Let me guess what this is. This must be the new unbearable disgusting ultrasonic sound wave on which Stephen Hawking is working on recently?

Modi: No! It is named after me. It is my charm.. my luck… my wave in elections. It is the reason why BJP got more than 280 seats in Indian General elections in 2014. I lost it recently.

SH: BJP, let me guess. This is a political party in India?

Watson: Ah.. finally, you got it right this time..

SH: And BJP is an acronym for? let me guess.. Bhakt Jan Parivaar?

Modi: Oh God! The articles in UK papers are showing the effect. You are a detective, don’t believe the media! BJP is ‘Bhakt Janata Party’.. oops.. sorry.. I mean it is ‘Bharatiya Janata Party’.

SH: Okay.. Mr Modi. May I know on what day you have exactly lost your ‘Modi wave’?

Modi: I don’t know. It was somewhere before Delhi elections..

SH: Do you have any suspects?

Modi: Yes, Kejriwal. it must be him!

SH: Hmm.. Kejriwal. I know this guy, we have received few other complaints as well. let me guess how this happened…

Watson: Sherlock, Please!!! Stop guessing, you are not doing it right anyway today. Please ask Mr Modi to continue.

SH: Okay Watson.. Mr Modi.. Please continue.. Why do you think. it is Kejriwal?

Modi: I used to have ‘Modi Wave’ in my pocket, till Varanasi election campaign during General Elections. Kejriwal was with me in that campaign fighting against me. I am sure he might have taken my wave and hiding under his muffler. He tweeted against BJP during Bihar elections too.

SH: Hmm.. That’s enough Mr Modi. We will start investigating what is under Kejriwal’s muffler and will get you back the ‘Modi wave’.

Watson: And the title of my new blog post is ‘The case of missing Modi wave’.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-spending-dussehra-deepavali-vacations-at-home-pm-modi-resumes-his-routine-work-by-travelling-abroad-8565,"New Delhi. After an extended Dussehra and Deepavali vacation, PM Modi will resume his foreign visits this week starting with UK, followed by Turkey, Malaysia and Singapore all in this November. Before the year comes to end, an important trip to Russia is planned before Christmas vacation starts.

As per our sources in PMO, due to shortage of time, China and Pakistan visits have been postponed to next year. One of the senior bureaucrat working in PMO spoke to us on the condition of anonymity. According to the official, “It was a pretty long break for PM because of Bihar election. Please remember PM had come back to India on October 1st from US and you can see more than 40 days gap between US and UK visit.”

Narendra Modi resuming his regular work

“Nothing much we could have done. PM wanted to campaign in Bihar and help his party to come to power. On other side he was equally upset that his routine work which he usually does by travelling abroad came to a halt. He directed us to push all the October visits to November. It is tough for anyone to manage four high profile visits within 15 days. He has assured us, he can manage. We wanted to push couple of visits towards end of December to give proper gap between visits, but foreign offices of these countries rejected our proposal saying their heads will not be available during Christmas and New Year vacation time,” the official added.

The official further said, “We feel for our PM. Last year during Navratri fasting he was in US, luckily this year Navratri came after his US trip, but no rest. He had to campaign for Bihar 1st phase election during his fasting. We feel he needs to delegate some of his foreign trips to others like Dhoni did by handing over test captaincy to Kohli. My suggestion would be, he should focus on big ones like US, UK, Australia, France, Germany kind of countries, say all G-8 countries. Outside of G-8 countries visit, he should nominate his ministers looking at their performance. It would be kind of performance incentive bonus for these ministers.”

When we pointed out most of PM’s visits happen between June to December, to give him some respite, trips can be arranged between Jan and May. The official was quick to rebuke and said, “Please note this is the case for only 2015. Modiji came to power to in May 2014 and we immediately arranged his foreign trips starting from June. Last year he had so many trips abroad between June and December, we thought of giving him a break. He is not super human, he also deserves break. We also need to make arrangement such a way that he gets chance to spend some quality time at home in India.”

“In hindsight we feel, we did a mistake. We will not repeat the same next year. China and Pakistan visits, we are trying to arrange as early as possible in 2016. I can’t disclose now, we are discussing with many countries to give us go ahead for arranging trips in early part of 2016. By the way Jan to April is a lean period for travel both for foreign as well as domestic. Even our own IRCTC works fine during this period without crashing. We would be able to save some money as the travel cost will be lower for the PMO during this period,” Official concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/modi-foreign-trip-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-spending-dussehra-deepavali-vacations-at-home-pm-modi-resumes-his-routine-work-by-travelling-abroad-8565,"After spending Dussehra & Deepavali vacations at home, PM Modi resumes his routine work by travelling abroad",,1447317879.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dogs-protest-against-bjp-leaders-for-dragging-them-into-dog-fights-8562,"New Delhi: The dogged way in which BJP leaders are attacking their own party men after the results of Bihar elections has caused a lot of heartburn to the dog community.

Dogs concerned with their names being dragged into political fights

From Modi’s puppy remark during 2014 elections to the recent exchange of words between Shatrughan Sinha and Vijayvargiya, dogs have been hogging headlines for the wrong reasons.

“Initially they used to call Digvijay Singh as Dogvijay Singh which was humiliating in itself but now they are going a step further and dragging us unnecessarily in their verbal duels,” said a golden retriever who didn’t wish to be named.

Around 500 dogs from the national capital are planning a silent protest march and if sources are to be believed a hunger strike is also on cards, if the government doesn’t reign in those who defame dogs.

Meanwhile, a section of dogs have approached Don, Somnath Bharti’s dog who is also the president of dog wing of Aam Janvar Party. “Dog’s are not happy at being singled out and I can empathize with them. A section of dogs have filed a petition asking for a ban on politicians from dragging dogs into political fights,” he said.

“It’s not easy for dogs these days, the other day I was watching TV and this singer called Abhijeet was saying something about footpaths and dogs. Itne bure din aa gaye hai hamare,” he added.

The rising intolerance against dogs has also prompted President Obama to issue a statement asking PM Modi to make the environment in India conducive for dogs.

Meanwhile a primetime debate which sought the address the issue of growing intolerance against dogs saw the anchor barking away all most of the politicians on the panel.

“Every dog has his day but it turns out that every day is a ‘dog day’ for these leaders. There are so many other animals. Why only dogs and why not cats. I hold bollywood partly responsible for starting this trend. Why don’t they have billi mai tera khoon pi jaaonga?” questioned the fiery news anchor.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dogs.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dogs-protest-against-bjp-leaders-for-dragging-them-into-dog-fights-8562,Dogs protest against BJP leaders for dragging them into dog fights,,1447151420.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Incidentally, she was on the road outside Congress party Headquarters here, when this miraculous cure happened.

Even the Delhi air felt cleaner on that day. But it will be polluted again on Diwali and I may get back my breathing illness,” said Sheila with a sad face.

Sheila Butt, aged 38, the environmental activist who claimed about this cure, spoke to us, “Before talking about this miracle, I have to say how I started this noble campaign against Crackers. I was born in a Hindu family and my father along with my brothers used to burst a lot of crackers during Diwali. Because of the harmful smoke and the dangerous decibels that emanated from the crackers burst during Diwali, I got this breathing problem at the age of 17. Even after running from small clinics to respiratory specialists for a year, my breathing problem never got cured. So, at the age of 18, when I was in my first year of college, I started a rally a week before the Diwali, requesting people around my college to avoid crackers on Diwali.”

Suppressing her wide smile, she continued, “There was no turning back then. I did not get any job, so I became an activist. Because of my effective campaigning for the past twenty years, many families gave up crackers and instead either hugged each other or played NaragasurMom-NaragasurChild during Diwali. But my health did not improve. Whenever there is cracker smoke around, I end up having fits of cough. So, I never venture out in Diwali week. I had suffered a lot in the past twenty years, till 8th November 2015.”

“I was walking on the Akbar Road, last Sunday, when we heard that Laluji is winning the Bihar elections. Being an ardent Congress voter all my life, I am happy this time that the party which was supported by Congress won it. This was a slap on the face of anti-Environment Hindutva parties. With all these happiness, I forgot that I did not cough even after crackers were bursting all around me in the road and I was enveloped by cracker smoke. For the first time in my life, my illness related to cracker smoke has stopped. This Bihar election is indeed a vote against my breathing intolerance,” beamed Sheila.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/congress-celebrations-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/crackers-burst-outside-congress-party-hq-on-sunday-cured-my-breathing-problem-environment-activist-8560,Crackers burst outside Congress party HQ on Sunday cured my breathing problem- Environment Activist,,1447139600.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“My preparation for last few weeks has been on the ground that we will win zero seats if we are at our best or with slightly worst performance we might win up to 5 seats. This is something I was repeatedly reminding my party leadership and was telling them if you see Congress will fall below it’s current form, please let me know advance. It is not easy to face the panel on live TV debates especially the ones hosted by Arnab without doing proper ground work.”

Mr. Tiwari added, “That’s reason I did not participate in any of the live TV debates. By evening I got a chance to speak to Mr. Rahul Gandhi who was equally upset that his track record of lower output with every election has come to an end.”

Mr. Gandhi told me, “I cancelled my foreign trips and come back to India so that I can campaign extensively. I did not want others in my party to get a chance to campaign. This is to ensure we are on our path of reaching zero seats everywhere by 2019. Whatever you do, there are others who want to do one better. Now looks like BJP under Modiji is also trying to copy my formula.”

Manish said, “As Rahulji has apologized to me personally, I consider this as end. He has also told me to prepare extensively so that we can master the art of defending zero seats in future. He has assured me that he will work much more and do whatever is needed to achieve his dream.”

“Rahulji told me, he has called for an emergency meeting of the party core group and he has invited all the new 27 MLAs to join that meeting. We have few tough questions for them. They need to explain what all they have promised to voters so that they have voted for them. Last we expect our party to be called a feku party who only speak and do not deliver,” Manish said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sonia-rahul.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-deeply-introspect-on-its-unexpected-performance-in-bihar-election-high-command-calls-for-an-emergency-meeting-8556,"Congress to deeply introspect on its unexpected performance in Bihar election, high command calls for an emergency meeting",,1447049352.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/who-declares-modi-intolerance-a-new-epidemic-in-india-with-number-of-cases-surpassing-lactose-intolerance-8552,"In a recent study, the World Health Organization has found an alarming number of cases of a new condition, which is now termed as ‘Modi Intolerance’, named so due to a certain set of typical symptoms shown by the victims.

WHO declares intolerance as epidemic

Following is an excerpt from the WHO report :

“Indian population is known to be affected by medical conditions like lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance and intolerance to certain other food substances. While lactose intolerance is widespread, though unnoticed, gluten intolerance too is found in significant numbers. However, a large section of the Indian population is now found to have been suffering from a new such condition and it has assumed epidemic proportions. Since a typical symptom exhibited by all victims, though not expressed explicitly, is the varying degrees of dislike for the country’s Prime Minister Modi and his party, with or without reason, the condition has been named Modi Intolerance. The extent of dislike varies from plain dislike to angst to disgust to pure and utter hatred, and the situation is likely to negatively affect the health, if not of the carrier of the disease, certainly of the nation.”

In a press conference subsequent to release of the above report, an official from the WHO India office briefed reporters.

Reporter: Is this condition found only in India?

WHO: Yes, this is found predominantly only in India. There are a few cases reported from other countries, but it is restricted to people of Indian origin only. A variant of this is found in countries neighboring India, which are belligerent towards India. I don’t want to name them, but this condition may have spread from one those countries which are also known to send other entities across the border. It affects the political class and the military there.

Reporter: Since when has this disease affected Indians?

WHO: It was found in small numbers for several years now, restricted to areas around Gujarat. But it seems to have started increasing around the end of 2013, beginning of 2014 and spreading to other regions as well. There was huge jump in the numbers during May 2014 and has now proliferated throughout the country and assumed epidemic proportions.

Reporter: Who among Indians are affected most? Is there a pattern?

WHO: The pattern is getting discovered. Many, many people have mild signs of the disease. But strangely, severe cases seem to be confined to people of certain professions or industries. Like politicians, media, intelligentsia, academia, literati and such.

Reporter: What are the typical symptoms?

WHO: Just like in case of lactose intolerance where the victim cannot digest milk and milk products, here the victim cannot digest anything that Modi and his party say or do. They consider anything related to Modi and his party as bad. They attribute anything that goes wrong in the country to Modi. They try to find negatives even in positive developments. The condition worsens when Modi does not say anything in response to the victim’s behavior and utterances.

Reporter: How does the disease manifest itself?

WHO: It varies, but there is a pattern overall. It shows up at two levels. At the physical level, it starts as anger, blabbering, shouting, making absurd statements and then staging dharnas, carrying out marches, etc. At what can be called as abstract or philosophical level, some people give up their possessions, like awards and recognitions, which they got deservedly or otherwise. Some have even returned library books borrowed years ago that they had never intended returning. Others give up their coveted positions in bodies, committees. In fact, a good number of you from the media are said to be seriously suffering from this condition. In a few cases, the victims display phobia of saffron colour. Distortion of facts and exaggeration are pretty much common to all the people. Forcing others to behave similarly is another common sign.

Reporter: How does it spread?

WHO: Mainly word of mouth. One person blabbers and the next one catches it and blabbers too. Another reason for spreading is peer pressure. Again, you people from the media are identified as the carriers of the disease. You help spread the disease fast.

Reporter: What is the remedy?

Self help. One has to cure himself or herself of it. For now there is no medicine. And the carriers like you should behave responsibly and contain the disease rather than spreading it. The number of cases surpasses that of lactose intolerance and other food related intolerances.

WHO, in its statement, has hoped that India and its people will soon find a cure to it as the cure is really in their own hands.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/who.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/who-declares-modi-intolerance-a-new-epidemic-in-india-with-number-of-cases-surpassing-lactose-intolerance-8552,"WHO declares ‘Modi Intolerance’ a new epidemic in India, with number of cases surpassing lactose intolerance",,1446875796.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-manufacture-assembled-awards-so-that-returnee-can-return-his-part-of-the-award-without-hurting-teams-sentiments-8553,"New Delhi: Gone are the days when only one indivisible award was given to the entire team, paying no heed to the sentiments of the whole team and their desire to own the precious cup or trophy, while only the most dominating person of the winning team would get to keep it.

Prototype of an assembled award

Yes, we are talking about the government’s new scheme “Samvet Puraskar Yojana” that promises comforting convenience to the award winning personalities. Today, high profile national awards given by the government come as single unit irrespective of the fact whether it is conferred upon an individual or the whole team. Usually, the trophy goes to the most commanding personality rather than the most demanding.

With the new scheme, an award will appear to be a single unit but in fact, it will be an assembly of multiple parts. Judges will be entitled to map a part each to every team member of the winning team. For example, base of the award can be owned by choreographer while the jewel on its hilt could go to lead female in the team. This way every one gets to keep their part depending on how big a part they played in having the team win the award.

As this is pre-designated by the judges, there will be no chance of grudges among team members. Also, whenever there are signs of slightest intolerance in the country, a prospect returnee from the team can return his part!

Intellectuals from various fields seemed quite happy with Samvet Puraskar Yojana’s announcement; something that happened for the first time in last 1 to 2 years.

Dibakar Banerjee, who had returned the team award without taking consent from anyone from the team said, “If this Yojana was announced a little earlier, I wouldn’t have had to face intolerance arising from my intolerance towards climate of country’s intolerance.”

Sources say, government has taken a very good step by separating the concerns by simply separating the parts of award. This could well end up being a master stroke given its potential to bring out the genuine percentage of intolerance in the country.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gold-trophy-300x199.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-manufacture-assembled-awards-so-that-returnee-can-return-his-part-of-the-award-without-hurting-teams-sentiments-8553,Govt. to manufacture 'assembled' awards so that returnee can return his part of the award without hurting team's sentiments,,1446873022.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/frustrated-delhiite-files-rti-to-know-if-delhi-cm-has-any-constitutional-power-at-all-8490,"New Delhi: Tired of Delhi CM blaming everything on center government, Ajay Khosla, a resident of Amar Colony, Lajpat Nagar in South Delhi has filed an RTI query seeking what exactly comes under the constitutional powers of Delhi CM.

Confused look on Kejriwal’s face is similar to that on most people living in Delhi

As per him, “In last 8 months we got to know what all things he cannot do. But will we ever get to know what things he can do? Does he have any constitutional power at all?”

In Feb 2015 Delhi elected a new government with the hopes of becoming a city that is safe for its women and justifying the tag of national capital. But unfortunately Delhi routinely finds itself confused whether the humongous task of improving the city belongs to the Central Govt, LG or the CM.

Be it MCD Garbage mess, framing corruption charges on Sheila Dixit, appointment of DCW Chief Swati Maliwal or recent cases of brutal assault on small girls there is always the situation of confusion who actually calls the shots in Delhi.

“It was so easy 2 years back when same party was in State and Center. You could blame them for anything from law and order, to corruption or even court verdict in Jessica Lal case. But now it has become tricky. For initial 2-3 months, whenever there used to be a problem in Delhi I used to wait to see who tweets first to take political mileage. If Satish Upadhyay Tweets about any crisis, then it has to be responsibility of state,” Ajay Khosla said.

“If Kejriwal or Ashutosh takes a dig, then center has to be blamed. In a way we were becoming aware which issue is a state subject and which is not. But it cannot go like this forever. I can’t wait for 5 years to find out why we elected Kejriwal,” he continued.

According to our sources, the RTI query is lying unanswered for weeks, as RTI office is not sure which department can provide this information. Even Babus don’t know who is responsible for what in Delhi.

When Shaitaan Khopdi™ asked an AAP volunteer cum RTI activist about Khosla’s pending RTI query; he replied, “RTI query is blocked by either LG or Modi. Because they want to take revenge from Delhi and don’t want to let Arvind perform.”

On the other hand a BJP supporter responded to same question by saying, “Ye log bas raita faila sakte hain. Lekin democracy me Raita allowed hai. Haan agar unko Raita ke sath Beef khana hai to hum bilkul allow nahi karenge.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/238335-kejriwal03-300x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/frustrated-delhiite-files-rti-to-know-if-delhi-cm-has-any-constitutional-power-at-all-8490,Frustrated Delhiite files RTI to know if Delhi CM has any constitutional power at all,,1445238803.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/secret-bihar-election-diary-lalu-writes-about-ceiling-fan-falling-near-him-8488,"Dear Diary,

One thing was proven today, that those who are honest, true to their cause and passionate for their people are the ones even God cares for a lot.

Today, I survived a ceiling fan attack. The fan was put by that shaitaan Modi to cut my head, but bhagwaan is with me, and I survived. The fan couldn’t even touch me. This is the power of my honesty, my integrity, and my truthfulness.

I may not be seen as honest by some casteist people of Bihar, by a few communal people in media, by some alliance party workers, by some of my extended family members, or even by the blind beggar who stands outside my house. But I am honest to myself, to my own self. I know exactly what I am. That’s honesty, and that counts.

Lalu Yadav checking his head after the fan narrowly missed it

And this honesty will make me the king-maker of Bihar this time. Manjhi thinks he will be the king-maker, but he is a fool. I’ll be the leader who decides who becomes the CM, and who becomes the peon.

But just to clarify I am not afraid of these ceiling fan attacks. I am not even afraid when Modi attacks me in his speeches. That brahmpishaach Modi is all about numbers.

15 lakhs per person for aam aadmi, 80 crore package for Bihar, 56 inch chest for himself. What is this? Sounds like someone preparing for a maths exam. This is why my son did not study beyond class 9th. These people have made maths boring.

I am not into numbers you see. I am a people’s person. People ask me what GDP growth rate I can promise to Bihar? dhat budbak! I promise only one GDP – Government Doing People. I mean, government doing good for people.

We have to defeat communal forces. We have to defeat fascism. We have to defeat black magicians like Modi who sends ceiling fans to kill me.

But diary, but I have to admit. The fan falling did scare me a little. Whenever I sit in the helicopter, I look at the fan and I wonder if the helicopter’s fans are also with that Modi. But then I look at people waving at me – people half naked, with their starving cattle, in agricultural fields that don’t earn them enough – and I’m reminded of my honestly. Modi can’t kill me till people are like that. I mean till people wave at me.

Dear diary, after moving around in so many areas, I am convinced that Modi is like that ceiling fan, he will rotate all over Bihar and fill fall, but I am like the helicopter’s fan – I will rotate and rise.

Now let me book 3 helicopters for remaining campaign days. One for myself, one for Rabri, one for my buffalo Gulabo.

Ok dear diary, it’s time for me to sleep, to enter the dream world. May I rise like helicopters, while others fall like ceiling fans.

Good Night.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lalu1-300x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/secret-bihar-election-diary-lalu-writes-about-ceiling-fan-falling-near-him-8488,Secret Bihar Election Diary: Lalu writes about ceiling fan falling near him,,1445159789.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upsc-aspirants-request-all-award-recipients-to-return-their-awards-so-that-they-can-remember-their-names-8485,"Lucknow. A group of graduates preparing for Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams has initiated an online signature campaign, requesting all award winners to return back their awards to Central government as soon as possible, so that it will be easy for them to remember their names.

We contacted the brain behind this bizarre online campaign, Suresh Yadav. Yadav was jubilant when answering the phone call, “Yes! Yes! We were the group who had asked award winners to return back their awards. Look, I and several others in that group had been attempting UPSC for three years. We had grown tired of repeatedly spending too many days of our lives preparing for the exams and not getting qualified for the UPSC mains exam. When we analyzed where we falter, we found out that almost all of us had failed in the questions asked on awards being provided by govt and famous independent agencies. It is very hard to remember those names, provided the fact that none of the award recipients had written anything that was liked by the masses.”

No more scratching your head trying to memorise names of award recipients. You will see them all in news channels and papers almost daily.

“We almost resigned to our fate that we cannot be IAS or IPS and decided that we will go back to working in private sector if we fail the next attempt. And it was when we heard the news about Sahitya Akademi award winners returning back their awards to the government, citing the growing intolerance in Modi’s India. To hell with intolerance, but, this is like a God-sent opportunity to us. I spoke up with my institute mates and we decided to utilise this opportunity to clear UPSC exams next year. When we were unclear about how to make our campaign heard to the award winners, one of our member informed us about the online campaign website. And, the rest is all you saw in that petition,” finished Yadav, without giving a pause.

Uttering a giggle, Yadav added, “We do not want just one or two guys to give up their awards. We want all of them, those who got Padma awards, Sahitya Akademi awards, National awards, to return back their award, so that we can remember their name.”

When we asked him, ‘How they can memorise the names now and not before?’, he replied, “Arre! Seeing something visuals register easily in the memory than reading it a hundred times. All the news channels and newspapers will carry the photos of the award returners along with their names, which will be registered in our brain, so much so that we won’t forget it for years. I will be a sarkaari baabu soon. Yeehaa!” The phone line then went dead.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/exam4-300x230.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upsc-aspirants-request-all-award-recipients-to-return-their-awards-so-that-they-can-remember-their-names-8485,"UPSC aspirants request all award recipients to return their awards, so that they can remember their names",,1445068065.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/undeserved-award-return-scheme-to-be-launched-to-be-named-after-rajiv-gandhi-8484,"New Delhi. Central government has decided to launch an immunity scheme for those who want to return their undeserved awards, unnamed sources claimed. On the lines of black money disclosure scheme, this scheme would provide a window to all those who want to return their awards.

Surprisingly, this scheme would be called Rajiv Gandhi Undeserved Awards Return Scheme, sources reported.

Under this scheme, if the beneficiaries return their awards, they would not only be exempt from returning the cash rewards received along with the award as well as the money or position earned by virtue of being an awardee but also get immunity from the questions on how they won the awards; whether through a quid pro quo, or by promoting an ideology, or eulogizing an imbecile dynast or being the faithful bard to the royal family or by bribing someone or simply by keeping quiet on murder of innocents.

Government believes that hundreds of Academy awards, thousands of Padma awards, several Bharat Ratnas and lacs of other sundry ones which could be returned under the scheme and put to beneficial use.

We are confused as to who is more undeserving here; the awardee or the one handing out the award.

Faking News met a social economist Mr. Sambit Jha to understand the implications of this scheme. On our question about equating the awards with black money, he held forth, “Yes, the ill gotten awards are not much different from black money. How different is a Padma award won by suppressing a bribing scandal involving parliamentarians from the black money generated by that deal? How different is an academy award received from the hands of those who indulged in killing of thousands from the hefty bribe received by a Police officer for saving a mass murderer? How different is a Bharat Ratna given to oneself from siphoning off government money using fodder scam? How a Padma Shree award being given different is an award arranged from a fake institution abroad from printing your own fake currency? This equivocation between awards wangled through unfair means and black money is correct and justified.”

On chances of success of this scheme, Mr. Jha was even more categorical, “You see, the cost of maintaining an ill-gotten award has escalated. Earlier, it used to be simple; suppress a news like ‘Cash for Votes’, display a healthy bias, put a little spin, coin a phrase like ‘Internet Hindoo’ or abuse a right wing leader or even be a part time servant of the royal family and you would stay worthy of an award.

Now, life for the awardees is very difficult. Poor guys have to be on their toes all the time. They have to continuously convince people that some people are bigoted because they belong to a specific religion, some leaders are always divisive whatever they do, all incidents, even their maid coming late has to be given a motive, with a communal colour, outrage on the issue of freedom of expression at every incident, however unconnected. Recently, one particular beneficiary, while in a day’s work, got into fisticuffs with a crowd and almost got beaten to prove his worthiness. Many more are forced to be bashed daily on social media to prove their credentials, some have to even showcase imbecility in their utterances and actions so that the successors of those who gave them awards feel intelligent by comparison. Chances are many would return the awards and chose peace of mind than continue paying the high price the awards demand now.”

The leaders of Congress party, however, are confused about their reaction. Most of them are ecstatic that naming of schemes after their beloved leaders continues despite change in government but some who realize the blemish this scheme brings to the leader are not sure whether their present leadership would be able to configure the bad name it brings. All of them are awaiting word from their leader who is on his monthly vacation, somewhere unknown to all.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/D-2494l-300x231.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/undeserved-award-return-scheme-to-be-launched-to-be-named-after-rajiv-gandhi-8484,"Undeserved Award Return Scheme to be launched, to be named after Rajiv Gandhi",,1445066431.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/make-in-india-election-campaign-dominates-us-presidential-debate-as-donald-trump-calls-hillary-chudail-8476,"Washington: The US presidential campaign found an Indian connection and it’s not about candidates with Indian roots. Apparently, PM Modi’s pitch during his visit to US a few weeks back for ‘Make in India’ seems to be bearing fruit after clear references to India were seen dominating presidential debates.

Donald Trump mocking Hillary Clinton by calling her a chudail

The first instance of this domination was found when Republican candidate Donald Trump took to twitter to express his views on the Democratic Presidential Debate and ended up calling Hillary Clinton a ‘chudail’.

Late last night Mr. Trump tweeted, “What a boring debate by Hillary Clinton. Do you really want to vote for this ‘Chudail’?

Our reporter spoke to a source close to Donald Trump in an attempt to get more information on Mr. Trump’s strategy for the presidential elections. The source under condition of anonymity said, “Mr. Trump has been closely following Bihar elections and has been influenced by the way candidates indulge in name calling. He believes such name calling will not only give him the publicity he needs but also change the way people perceive his opponents.”

It has also been reported that Mr. Trump has hired a tutor to get the pronunciation correct so that he doesn’t sound like a fool on TV when he says these words.

“Yes it’s true; I have been training him for the past few months. I have also given him a book on ‘common Indian abuses’ which he carries along for all TV interviews and debates,” said Umesh Yadav, who is part of the team that handles Donald Trump’s election campaign.

It seems the trend has caught on with other politicians also. Democratic candidates were seen calling Donald Trump a ‘shaitaan’.

“Look at his hair, he looks like a narbhakshi(cannibal) and nothing less than a shaitaan. I urge American people to fight against such monsters,” said a democrat as he said a few hindi words in his American accent.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1trump.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/make-in-india-election-campaign-dominates-us-presidential-debate-as-donald-trump-calls-hillary-chudail-8476,Make in India election campaign dominates US presidential debate as Donald Trump calls Hillary 'Chudail',,1444816181.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lalu-plans-to-organize-a-faansi-protest-in-next-rally-to-prove-the-strength-of-his-swabhiman-8474,"Patna: For the first time in history of Bihar there would be a ‘Faansi’ Rally and it will be organized by none other than Lalu Prasad. But don’t worry this will be just symbolic faansi where in participants will just wear the noose around their necks, get some pictures clicked and do some naarebaazi.

Lalu Yadav explaining to the media what his rally is all about

Lalu will then share some subtle jokes, wave to the crowd ‘Sonia-ji style’ and all will be well.

In a press conference earlier today Lalu almost screamed into the microphone. He said, “Sasura, today I have ordered a 40 meter long rope on Falip kaarat daat caam in their Big bullion shaapping, to be delivered via express delivery. I am going to stage my ‘faansi’ protest next week.”

“And why am I doing this? Well, Modi is saying he will end reservation, and in response to that I have threatened that I’ll hang myself to death if that happens. Being a people’s person I am, I care a lot about that fact that people who belong to backwards classes should get their due rights and respect. They should get all the government freebies, even if they are filthy rich already,” Lalu suddenly spoke in fluent English which left the media shocked.

When media asked Lalu why he ordered a 40 meter rope, because usually a 10 meter rope is sufficient to hang one person till death, he smiled and explained, “Tum budbak samajhta nahin ho. I am not alone in this. Three more people would be participating in the ‘faansi’ rally with me, Nitiswa, Rahul baba and Mulayam ji. All four of us would stage this pre-planned ‘faansi’ in front of packed crowd. ‘Fantastic Four ki faansi’ will be the news headline the next day, I hope.”

“While Nitiswa and Rahulwa are my business partners within Bihar, Mulayam ji is our reliable off-shore politics management consultant. Although his billing-rate is pretty high, he has been offering some real solid consulting advice to our maha-gath-bandhan and is an integral part of our maha-swabhiman campaign against maha-fascist, maha-communal forces and maha-nikamma media. Hence he needs to be a part of this rally,” he said angrily.

Lalu’s ecstatic speech came to a sudden end with a loud noise of bullet fire in a nearby neighborhood which indicated the beginning of election season and sudden surge in employment numbers in Bihar.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lalu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lalu-plans-to-organize-a-faansi-protest-in-next-rally-to-prove-the-strength-of-his-swabhiman-8474,Lalu plans to organize a ‘Faansi’ protest in next rally to prove the strength of his Swabhiman,,1444806949.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Remember me? Of course you remember me. You are the only one who does remember me these days, nobody in BJP does. What do I do diary? I have not addressed even a single rally this time; They don’t even invite me to Modi’s rallies now. Haven’t felt this ignored since Zeenat Aman picked Amitabh over me in Dostana.

They placed me at Number 30 in the list of Star Campaigners, Number 30. Forget Bihar, Are there 29 bigger stars than me in India?

31 years I have been with BJP, 31 years! My wait for Bihar CM post has only been exceeded by Advani ji’s wait for PM post. But now it feels that wait will go on forever. I am not even in the running for the CM post. Not one person has mentioned my name anywhere. Even Advani ji doesn’t say anything in my support or says anything at all really. Maybe I should go visit him with some of my films’ DVDs, he loves reviewing films.

He might have gone Khamosh for now, but not his diary (cartoon by @NeelabhToons)

Media also seems to have lost interest in me these past few weeks. Apparently they have found bigger TRP topics in Uttar Pradesh. What are they doing in UP? Elections are in Bihar!

They should not give up on me. I am ready with my list of politicians against whom I have controversial statements, but nobody is visiting me now. What do I do with this list; recite it before going to bed like Arya Stark?

As you know I can’t resign, will have to give up my Lok Sabha seat. Hence, I tried to get myself fired, really did but even those attempts were ignored just like my son Luv Sinha’s film Sadiyaan.

What does one honest politician need to do to get himself fired around here? Praised Nitish, Praised Lalu, Praised Paswan over local BJP leaders and yet, no reaction.

Could have tried a scam to get myself fired but Modi didn’t give me any ministry either. Not even FTII chairman’s post for me. Gajendra Chauhan is apparently a better expert of cinema than me. GAJENDRA CHAUHAN… Have you seen his films diary?

Not even Maargdarshak Mandal for me because I haven’t crossed 80 yet. Where do I go from here diary?

If Nitish wins, maybe I can resign from BJP and get back to the Parliament using the Rajya Sabha route else I will have to look in the mirror and tell myself- KHAAMOSH!",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shatru-diary.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/secret-bihar-election-diary-shatrughan-sinha-records-an-entry-8470,Secret Bihar Election Diary: Shatrughan Sinha records an entry,,1444722181.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After this incident Mr. Kulkarni has decided to launch only e-books in future

Mr. Kulkarni who chose not to speak anything about the paint attack incident at the book launch, held a special press briefing to speak out on Shiv Sena’s brazen attack on him.

“I am not scared of Shiv Sena. In fact their desperation makes me laugh. All I am concerned about is that my painted face will be flashed across TV screens causing discomfort to a lot of people. So I have decided that I will be launching e-books online in future instead of doing them in person. That way I can launch a book without having to worry about attacks by Shiv Sainiks,” said Mr. Kulkarni wiping his face with a paint remover.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut was quick to respond. He said, “We have been and we will protest against book launch or any Pakistani artist performing in India. If Mr. Kulkarni plans to launch an e-book online, will use MS Paint to color his face black. All our sainiks are ready with their laptops and we will do everything possible to protest against him.”

Apparently, Shiv Sena has already distributed laptops among sainiks with specific instruction to blacken faces online of all those who show inclination towards Pakistan and its artistes. “We have made a list of all those who masquerade as liberals and all the resort to is petty politics. Many of them are on twitter, hiding behind anonymous accounts. We will launch an all out ‘DP blackening’ abhiyaan soon,” said a Sainik.

Mr. Kulkarni’s painted face did create some problems for him. Sources close to the politician said that his dogs started barking at him as he tried to enter his own house and his family members too called the police and reported an intruder after seeing him enter.

Meanwhile, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who had ink thrown at him on several occasions was seen sharing a few tips with Sudheendra Kulkarni on how to get rid of face paint.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sudheendra-kulkarni-225x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sudheendra-kulkarni-says-he-will-launch-e-books-in-future-shiv-sainiks-threaten-to-blacken-his-face-with-ms-paint-8466,Sudheendra Kulkarni says he will launch e-books in future; Shiv Sainiks threaten to blacken his face with MS Paint,,1444642953.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/secret-bihar-election-diary-nitish-kumar-writes-as-voting-begins-8469,"Dear diary,

Voting has begun and now barely a month is left before I could become Chief Minister of Bihar for yet another time. Modi thought only he could become CM of a state one time after another, but now I will show him that he has a tough competitor.

But things have been going tough for me of late. First some Modi supporters showed chappal to me in a rally, then mike stopped working in another, and now the worst – Awadhesh Kushwaha, my minister was filmed accepting cash in a sting operation.

What kind of a fool gets caught on sting operation accepting cash after seeing what happened to Bangaru Laxman of BJP? I did not expect Kushwaha to be such a fool.

Maybe this is all due to that long association with BJP. My men have started behaving like them. My campaign strategies are also similar to what Modi used last year during general elections. This must have confused my people. I just hope they don’t start talking about Jungle-raj of Lalu or start talking about gau-mata!

Nitish is confident of doing magic again (cartoon by @NeelabhToons)

But despite these issues, I think I will become CM again. My gut feeling says so. My journalist friends say so. And even Arvind Kejriwal says so.

Kejriwal’s victory has given us hope that Modi can be defeated. Kejriwal’s men were also caught in sting operation before elections, but look, he won. He won because he said sorry and because he promised to half electricity bill.

I have already said sorry for making Manjhi the CM, but my problem is promising to half electricity bill. Many areas in Bihar are still to get electricity. You know diary, half of zero is still zero, so this arithmetic is not working for me.

But don’t worry diary, the caste arithmetic will work. Laluji is doing everything to make it work. He just has to keep some statements and Rahul Gandhi in control.

People ask me what if Laluji doesn’t let me work. What if it is his conspiracy to give me CM’s post and screw my next term with no development work, so that he can prove that I’m just as good as him? Is he trying to finish my political career and restart his and his family’s?

These questions scare me diary. But then I think – if I survived Manjhi, I can survive anything. If no development takes place, I can always blame Modi government. Let Laluji try to become Najeeb Jung, I will become Arvind Kejriwal.

Don’t worry diary, you will get a nice shelf in the Chief Minister’s Office. See you soon, first let me see what Modi is speaking in his rally.

Another day gone, another step closer to the CM post. Don’t you miss the CM bungalow diary? I know you do. Even I miss that place. Just few more days diary, and then we return to the place where we belong.

Don’t worry about the fact that we are fighting on only 21 seats. Opinion polls are predicting very tight result diary and as you know, in a tight finish, we will be kingmakers. If we are kingmakers, then why shouldn’t I crown myself King? If BJP gives CM post fine, else we will flip again diary.

What is on Manjhi’s mind (cartoon by @NeelabhToons)

But It hasn’t been easy. My son-in-law rebelled against me. Can you believe that, my son-in-law? If he had to embarrass me, at least he could have embarrassed me like Vadra by becoming super rich very quickly. At least I would have received money along with embarrassment. But no, he had to rebel and fight as an independent.

It won’t hurt me though diary. This shouldn’t stop my march to the CM bungalow. Once I return to that CM bungalow diary, I will deploy 10 policemen per mango tree to stop Nitish Kumar from having any mangoes from that garden. Let’s see how Nitish babu reacts when the shoe is on the other foot. Forget policemen, I will deploy black cat commandos there with shoot at sight order.

I know Paswan ji is also hoping for the CM post in his heart, but he already is a minister in Centre Government. Why is he so greedy? Or does he think his son should become CM? I am sure Modi ji won’t entertain him. His son is too naïve to become CM, but maybe I will make him a minister in my cabinet. Bungalow doors will be secured this way.

Anyway, Paswans don’t have any experience of running a state, I do diary. Oh and how I ran the state. No JDU MLA was sure whether he is in the government or in the opposition. BJP MLAs had no clue whether they are opposing the government or opposing the opposition. RJD MLAs thought they are part of the government when they were part of the opposition. Fun times diary, fun times.

Nitish and Lalu ran Bihar like a Prakash Jha film. I ran Bihar like the climax of a Priyadarshan film. Full comedy, full chaos, full entertainment. As you know diary, laughter is the best medicine, I treated Biharis free of cost by providing that medicine. Why will they not want me back?

Now I have to go and rest diary. My hands are hurting from clapping during Modi ji’s speeches all day; have to do it again tomorrow. How much he talks diary and expects applause after every sentence.

As per Govt. sources, incessant milking of the Dadri incident by politicians and media has led to acute shortage of milk.

Acute shortage of milk in Dadri due to incessant milking by media and politicians

A government source close to the development spoke to Faking News reporter and said, “Since the Dadri incident took place, politicians, media and a few publicity hungry individuals have swooped down on Dadri and the milking has not stopped to date. Our estimate is that, around 12000 metric tonnes has been milked by politicians themselves. It has led to acute shortage, which cannot be addressed by diverting milk from neighboring areas alone. That is why we are ordering milk packets.”

It has been a tough last week for residents of Dadri. Jivan Singh, a 92 year old farmer from Dadri said, “Kitna doodhe nichodh kar le gaye ye neta. I don’t even have milk to make tea now. Something like this has never happened in the history of Dadri ever before.”

He didn’t spare the media too. “Media people are camping here and I don’t know when they will leave. They are a step ahead of politicians. They are not just milking but also coming with their milk products like cheese and curd,” he said.

Officials from the National Dairy Development Board have said that they are doing all they can to meet the requirement. “We estimate that the shortfall will continue till results of Bihar elections are declared. We can only appeal to media and politicians to exercise some restraint,” said a board official as he dispatched another consignment of milk powder.

Meanwhile, a team from the American Dairy Research Institute was on a short visit to India to study the Dadri incident. “We would just like to know the specifics about how an incident was milked to such an extent. We have been researching on milk production technologies for quite some time now and nowhere else in the world would you find an example like this,” said Tom Selleck, a team member as he replied to a news reporter and cameraman who were determined to milk the last drop from Dadri incident.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dadri_Railway_Station_2011-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-ship-500-packets-of-milk-powder-to-dadri-to-address-shortfall-after-incessant-milking-by-politicians-and-media-8461,Govt. to ship 500 packets of milk powder to Dadri to address shortfall after incessant milking by politicians and media,,1444541308.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The nightmare just won’t end. My beef remark continues to haunt me as Narendra Modi today took several digs at me in his rally. Remember I told you last time that Shaitaan sat on my tongue and made me comment on beef. I swear Shaitaan sat on my tongue, Shaitaan or Dhatura, I am not very sure.

Now Modi is making this a big political agenda and raising it in his rallies. Murder happened in UP, CM is from Samajwadi Party, local MP is from BJP, PM is from BJP and I am facing the most heat!

Lesson learnt diary – sometimes it is better to hold one’s tongue. I have bought huge stocks of chewing gums to keep my tongue in check for the next 1 month.

Lalu writing down his feelings (cartoon by @NeelabhToons)

But you can understand these slips of tongue. The pressure on me has increased several folds now. As it is I was feeling like Tendulkar from the 90s in this coalition team. Everything I have to do here. I have to raise controversial issues, I have to gather crowds for the rallies, I have to give the longest speeches, I have to bring caste, religion into everything while Nitish Kumar becomes progressive by raising only development.

And after all this, I won’t even be getting the CM chair if we win! That will be for Nitish Kumar. It’s like Azhar being the captain while Sachin delivered every win.

Nitish is totally like Azharuddin; was very good for a decade of his playing career but now he is a liability for most part. His decision to seek Kejriwal’s support in Bihar made as much sense as Azhar asking Manoj Prabhakar to bowl spin against Sri Lanka.

And then I have Rahul Gandhi. Don’t laugh diary. He is like Venkatesh Prasad, even when he bowls his fast bouncer, opponents get so much time to hit him for a six with ease.

And Mulayam, Mulayam ji has turned out to be my Vinod Kambli, old friend but now he just dislikes me. Why did he create that 3rd front to cut our votes?

On top of that, there are match fixers in my own team who are getting caught taking payment of 4 Lakhs. 4 lakhs, could have taken some loose change from me but no, Nitish’s ministers have to go hit wicket when you need partnerships.

Only help I got from was RSS. Mohan Bhagwat looked like Rahul Dravid to me – dependable but never in spotlight. His remark on reservation is getting ignored by everyone except me, while my beef remark is being shared widely.

Just hope I don’t get bowled out in this game of political cricket.

I am telling you diary, this election is tougher than the time I spent in prison. Sometimes I feel like running back to that prison, at least they still treat you like a VIP inside a prison. Outside prison, Haramzaada media doesn’t leave me alone for a second. If only I could bring in emergency and censor them!

Oh, shouldn’t entertain thoughts of Emergency around JP Sir’s birth anniversary. Better go to sleep now to avoid these thoughts.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/shaitan-bhoot-and-pishach-not-sure-about-whom-to-support-during-bihar-elections-8458,"Patna: The war of words between Lalu Yadav and Narendra Modi has not only confused the voters in Bihar but has also divided the Shaitan, Bhoot and Pishach community in Bihar.

A ghost confused about whom to support

After political parties resorted to name calling, which led to Shaitans coming under spotlight, many from the community thought it would be wise discuss and reach a consensus about whom they would vote for the upcoming Bihar elections.

A discussion held in a graveyard by a committee that represents the community of Ghosts and Witches, sought to reach a consensus regarding whom to support during the Bihar Elections.

A bunch of Pishach’s openly supported Lalu Yadav. “Laluji is not against beef eaters. His views work for me. If BJP comes to power in Bihar, we will have to starve,” said Munni Pishcah as other Pishach’s wailed in support.

A few Bhoots chose to differ. “Modiji is best for Bihar and our community. He is never in one place and prefers roaming around. As a bhoot, it appeals to me. If BJP wins in Bihar, I will get a chance to not only roam across Bihar, but also go to foreign locations,” said Bhootnath, a 75 year old ghost.

Meanwhile, a Shaitan who was moderating the discussion and not let anyone speak screamed at the top of his voice and said, “Ghosts and witches the phone lines are open, please call and let us know who will you vote for?”

The discussion was marked with a lot of disagreements, with no consensus having reached. The second half of the discussion turned into a heated debate with name calling and wild accusations.

Bhoot called the Chudail as Lalu and Chudail called Shaitan as Modi with chaotic scenes witnessed by Faking News reporter.

Uddhav Thackeray rehearsing for the Ghazal concert

Speaking to Faking News the party chief said, “I would like to clarify my party’s stand on this issue once and for all. I am not against Ghulam Ali in fact I am also a fan of the singer. I am against Pakistan’s support to terror activities. But, I know a lot of people have already purchased tickets for the concert, so for the benefit of those people I have agreed to sing Ghazals myself.”

Sena leader Sanjay Raut added, “Uddhav saheb is a very good singer and has been singing since his college days. Very few people are aware about this side of his personality. He is very passionate about photography and singing and has given many stage performances also.”

Many of those who were disappointed with the cancellation of the show are now hoping that Uddhav Thackeray’s performance will be worth their money.

However, Cousin Raj Thackeray has advised Uddhav to reconsider his decision. “Tomorrow the party may oppose New Years concert by a celeb. Do you expect Uddhavji to perform there too?” he asked our reporter in his trademark style.

Meanwhile, BJP was critical of Shiv Sena chief’s offer to sing. “We know Uddhavji through his performance will take potshot at us again. He will use Ghulam Ali’s ghazal ‘Chupke Chupke raat din ansoo bahana yaad hai’ point out how Shiv Sena found itself isolated after elections. Also, ‘baatein jhooti baatein hai’ will give him a chance to criticize us on not keeping the promises made before elections.

Although, BJP has said that the show venue can be changed from Mumbai to Delhi there were reports that some ‘ban-loving’ groups were already protesting against Ghulam Ali’s entry into India.

“Ghulam anagrams to Mughal and we cannot let him set foot in the country after what Mughals did to our country,” said an activist belonging to one such group as he raised slogans against the singer.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/uddhav-ghulam-ali-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/uddhav-thackeray-to-sing-ghazals-for-those-who-paid-for-the-tickets-of-ghulam-ali-concert-8455,Uddhav Thackeray to sing Ghazals for those who paid for the tickets of Ghulam Ali concert,,1444297284.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Arvind Kejriwal reacting after someone asked him what he will do if people of Bihar will not allow him to change his DP

Taking time out from his busy weekend movie marathon schedule, Kejriwal announced via his twitter account that he will take this step to avoid any confusion and rumors among people including him and Lalu Prasad Yadav.

He also said that he is different from Modi and believes in democracy. He will change his DP only after people of Bihar will allow him to do so.

Later, AAP spokesperson Ashutosh in press conference declared the date of ‘DP parivartan rally’ in Patna. Rally will be addressed by Arvind Kejriwal where he will ask people as to whether he should change DP or not.

When journalist from TimePass News asked, ”Did Kejriwal get this idea from Mark Zuckerberg?” Ashutosh reacted instantly and blamed Modi for it.

He said, “It is original idea of Arvind ji. When Arvind ji met Modi ji after taking oath of Delhi Chief Minister, he shared this idea with Modi ji.” AAP spokesperson further accused Modi to tell this idea to Mark Zuckerberg during his recent visit of Facebook head quarter.

Reacting to question from journalist that did Kejriwal support Lalu Yadav as both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav are in alliance, Ashutosh asked in reply, “Did you support internet.org when you changed DP to support digital india?” Journalist couldn’t ask more questions as Ashutosh burst into tears.

Some journalists speculate that Ashutosh is missing his mother. When one journalist asked about sudden tears, Ashutosh replied,”Modi” and left the pressconference.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/due-to-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-delhi-is-filled-with-clean-water-which-is-causing-dengue-aap-8426,"New Delhi. For the exponential rise of dengue cases in Delhi, AAP blames the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which PM launched last year. Recently AAP constituted an internal committee under Mr. Ashutosh to find out the reason behind the outbreak of dengue in the capital.

After missing few deadlines it had internally set for itself, Ashutosh submitted the preliminary report to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal when he was the watching “Calendar Girls” along with the cast and crew of the movie at his residence.

Though the report is not yet available in public domain, Mr. Ashutosh was kind enough to speak to us on the condition of anonymity because it is the first time he got a chance to head a party committee. We started by asking what is the reason behind the delay, as his predecessor Yogendra Yadav used to be ready with reports within a day or two. Mr. Ashutosh said, “This is not a report for electoral win or loss. We cannot be casual while preparing this report as dengue can potentially take away so many lives. We looked at all the aspects before making our conclusion.”

Ashutosh called us Modi agent when we suggested if his tears were cause of so much water around.

“According to us, the major reason is the abundant quantity of clean water in Delhi which as all of us know helps in the breeding of dengue mosquitos. Last year when PM launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, we could not protest properly because of our internal party issues. Now the bigger question is, why this was launched without understanding the side effects it can cause.”

Mr. Ashutosh added further, “We have done research to find dengue mosquitos bites proportionately higher number of AAP supporters. After we came to power, there is not much scope for strikes and protests, so most of our supporters take rest during day time when the dengue mosquitos are most active. We also stay in smaller houses. It is easy for the mosquito to travel from one room to other. One mosquito can potentially bite a full family within an hour”.

“Look at the central ministers, they stay in big bungalows surrounded by so many people all the time. Difficult for a mosquito to travel to all the rooms, even if it reach some room it will get confused with whom to bite as so many people will be present. Unlike them, we do not have so many supporters right now to hang around us”.

Mr. Ashutosh told us about the few recommendations he is going to submit in his final report to Akela Aadmi Party head Mr. Kejriwal. “We have told our supporters to remain active at least during the day time. If needed, we will launch few protests and strikes to keep them occupied. No need for us to follow Swachh Bharat Campaign to keep the water bodies in around us clean. We will soon find a way to make the water bodies unfriendly for dengue mosquitos”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/368-300x168.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/due-to-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-delhi-is-filled-with-clean-water-which-is-causing-dengue-aap-8426,"Due to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Delhi is filled with clean water which is causing dengue: AAP",,1443511760.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Last year UN adopted June 21st as world yoga day and now USA state department has recognized his importance and marked a day to honor his oratory skills which whole world has now started acknowledging. From next year onwards, last Sunday of September will be known as world onsite ‘mann ki baat’ day.

PM Modi getting ready for his first Mann ki Baat in US

The significance of the day will be, the head of a country can travel to a foreign location of his interest to address the people located there.

As per our sources, on this day, Modiji prefers to be in USA which is considered as the ultimate onsite job location for our techies.

As per the organizers of the event, unlike offshore ‘mann ki baat’ which is a monthly affair, onsite one will be yearly affair purely because of the logistics it demands. The venue will not be fixed, it will be rotated as this will give fair chance to people who are interested to see him live in action.

For next ten years the organizers have already shortlisted quite a few prestigious squares, corners and halls for this purpose.

USA state department has also pitched in to help. There will be no NBA matches for that matter no major sporting action, no live concert in the city which will host Modi’s address.

As this event will have bigger crowds than what they normally see during US presidential campaign, the department will arrange special public transport to help people reach venue on time and also to get back home without any hassle.

Tenders will be issued to select best of golgappa, vada pav, bhajji vendors from India who will be allowed to put their stalls. This will help in attracting even bigger crowds to the venue who would like to have taste of India.

We met senior Pravasi Bharatiya Mr. Velu who is staying in US for last thirty years. When we asked what makes Modiji so popular in spite of his so many foreign trips, he said, “Modiji is a real charmer. If you closely observe, you will find unlike our cricket team who are poor while travelling overseas, Modiji’s demeanour and public address ability remains pitch perfect even on foreign land. He has travelled to so many places belonging to different continents, everywhere he has been consistent. It will be hard for anyone to find even a single flaw in the speeches he has given.”

“This is all because the hard work he has put in to understand the pulse of the people who will be attending his public address. You will never find his speeches boring. It might be little long, but it will have something for everyone in attendance,” Mr. Velu concluded",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/usa-state-department-releases-new-calendar-for-2016-marks-last-sunday-of-sept-as-indian-pms-onsite-mann-ki-baat-day-8419,"USA state department releases new calendar for 2016, marks last Sunday of Sept as Indian PM’s onsite 'mann ki baat' day",,1443326505.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A woman from Delhi has changed her name to Arvind Kejriwal after she was repeatedly snubbed on social media by everyone other than Facebook and Twitter bots.

Kejriwal angry that people are using him to get publicity

Though reports suggest that the name entered by the applicant on the affidavit was actually #arvindkejriwal, the officials who processed it, erroneously omitted the hashtag as they assumed that it was an attempt to write her title that went wrong.

Speaking to media, she admitted that she wanted her name to be #arvindkejriwal so that she could see her name trending on Twitter the entire day, but in hindsight, she is glad that the hashtag was omitted because the topic, according to her, trends on Twitter for all the wrong reasons.

“The name without the hashtag is working just fine. I started getting 100 new Twitter followers every day, and now it’s performing even better since my husband has uploaded an image of a muffler as profile picture. Most importantly, the followers here retweet unlike those dead followers my other profile has. Even my Facebook account has exhausted 5000 friend limit,” she said.

She quickly checked her Twitter feed and continued, “Although, I am not sure why I am getting strange parcels and letters since I changed my name, like yesterday I received a ‘Punch-in-the-Box’ from someone who calls himself Governor’s office.”

Later at 9 pm, somewhere in a newsroom, a gentleman sitting alarmingly close to a bespectacled angry host expressed his concern, “This sets a dangerous precedent. Now we might see thousands of Rahul Gandhis, Narendra Modis, Arvind Kejriwals, and even Arnab Goswami’s. This would make life difficult for everyone, especially those who work in the postal department,” he said as he glanced at the host of the show from the corner of his eye.

However, experts don’t consider this an unusual incident, as renouncing one’s real identity on social networking websites is a common practice. According to them, a person suffering from Social Media Despondency Syndrome (SMDS) exhibits a behavioral pattern where he or she uploads a photograph on Twitter or Facebook, refreshes the page a few times, and then screams, “Cheater cocks, I liked all your posts!” and then quietly changes his or her username to a popular one.

As a matter of fact, they use famous names as user Id’s on social networking websites even before those famous personalities get to know about those platforms. The experts, however, feel that she has overreacted and that she could have just changed her username instead of real name.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kejriwal-angry.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tired-of-being-ignored-on-social-media-woman-changed-her-name-to-arvind-kejriwal-for-visibility-8414,"Tired of being ignored on social media, woman changed her name to Arvind Kejriwal for visibility",,1443170410.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Don: I thought I was Somnath’s Ashutosh, following every orders of him, but he treated me like Yogendra Yadav instead. Just like Yogendra was deserted by Kejriwal and had to sleep on floor, Bharti too has left me alone in Police Station to sleep on floor. I should have realized that my master’s priorities lie with safeguarding only beautiful women. And leave alone beautiful, I am not even female.

FN: But why do you think Somnath did not come for your help?

Don: Whenever he wanted to get something out of his wife Lipika, he would pester me to go on a fast, when she would not agree. He said since I was overweight, I was perfect for such gimmicks and wouldn’t even die. When I would refuse, he would get upset and start spamming mails of random people to cool him down. I think he is still mad at me.

FN: Tell us something more about the camaraderie you shared with Bharti during good times.

Don: We had lot of similarities. Like me, my master was most active during night. He too had a habit of not letting people sleep by raiding random houses, just like I don’t let people sleep by barking incessantly. In fact, I think Somnath was right when he claimed that he made that midnight raid at Khirki extension for women safety. He ventured out of his house during night, so that women in his house could remain safe.

FN: Are you disheartened with how you are being treated?

Don: Yeah, but I am also happy to be have become second most famous dog in Aam Aadmi Party after Ashutosh’s Mogu.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/somnath-bharti-dog-don_650x400_81442322295-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/exclusive-interview-with-somnath-bhartis-dog-8385,Exclusive interview with Somnath Bharti's dog,,1442392080.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-trips-and-falls-down-by-accident-in-kashmir-unidentified-youth-wave-pakistani-flag-8381,"Kashmir: After a series of events which caused the Pakistani flag to be waved randomly, it has come down to the flag again being waved due to a man falling down by mistake.

Pak flag being waved in Kashmir

“All blockades and tripping objects are a conspiracy. They are hurting our brethren,” asserted an unidentified youth waving the flag.

“If some more people keep falling down, we will go to Pakistan,” he threatened.

Even after the man himself admitted that he fell by mistake, the protesters have become more vocal in their agitation against the country.

“Today he slipped and survived. Tomorrow he might slip and he might die how will India protect him? We will not let our brother speak at all. We will speak on his behalf,” he added.

The man who fell down however has escaped his ‘brothers’ clutches and has come forth to the media to explain that it was his mistake and nobody pushed him.

“First of all I am not even a Kashmiri, in fact not even a Muslim, so I don’t know why they want to speak for me,” said Yin Min Yong, who was visiting Kashmir from China.

“I was walking normally but I stepped on underwear made using the ISIS flag, so I ended up slipping and falling down. I don’t know why they are causing unnecessary problem,” he questioned.

Hearing about this reason, many sensible Muslim supporters have left the group of protesters, while others insisted that China was an ally of Pakistan and thus they had all rights to speak on the issue.

“We don’t care about them. Soon there will be some other reason and we will convince them to come join us again. We make sure we feel everyone is victimized by India so any reason will be enough for us. Till then we will keep waving Pakistan’s flag,” said another individual condemning people who decided to end protests.

Due to ISIS flags being used as chaddis by poor Kashmiri kids, the protesters are searching for extra flags, by which they can protest more vociferously.

“We are out of flags so we are willing to accept any others apart from the Indian flag to start protesting. We are in the process of creating some flags containing upside down vada pavs and dosas to rebel against India,” said a volunteer.

There are also some talks that if the temperature increases by some more degrees melting snow in Kashmir, Pakistani flag will again be waved to protest against this attack on Kashmiriyat.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pak-flag.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-trips-and-falls-down-by-accident-in-kashmir-unidentified-youth-wave-pakistani-flag-8381,"Man trips and falls down by accident in Kashmir, unidentified youth wave Pakistani flag",,1442301406.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A chicken flash mob

Ashish the rooster, who organized the flash mob, spoke to Faking News amidst a sea of chickens that gyrated to latest bollywood numbers.

“We all are very happy with the meat ban. Few extra days to live mean a lot to us. So we are celebrating. I thank the Jain community for this favor. Some people say that it is politics, but we don’t care,” he said.

It was not just a chicken affair, media also was present and doing their best to manufacture something that could garner TRPs. Social media too was abuzz with the news as #chickenflashmob dominated the trending topic in India.

While there were celebrations all around in different poultry farms, a group of chicken was seen standing in a corner and protesting, hoping that the media would turn their cameras at the group.

The most vocal of the lot, wearing a muffler and topi was seen raising slogans against Shiv Sena chief for not supporting the ban. “I am wondering who is better at taking U-turns, is it Uddhav Thackeray or CM of Delhi.” he screamed.

They were also planning pre-emptive protest against a news anchor, who they believe would take up the issue of ‘meat ban’ on his debate and give it a religious twist.

“Our brothers are on the job and they are planning to gatecrash the debate. All we ask for is a few days reprieve and even that does not go down well with some people,” he said.

Meanwhile, some chickens that were picked up before the meat ban was announced were hopeful that they would get a day’s reprieve. “I was headed for KFC, but now with this meat ban, I am looking forward to going back home. Hopefully the authorities will work extra time and clear my case too, like they did for Bhai.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chicken-flash-mob.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/500-chickens-in-thane-participate-in-a-flash-mob-to-celebrate-meat-ban-8363,500 chickens in Thane participate in a flash mob to celebrate meat ban,,1441703404.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sunny Leone and Diapers done, what next?

According to Anjan, the diaper advertisements which showcase excessive absorption capacity are actually provoking the babies to pass susu more frequently thereby dirtying the moral fabric of the country.

Speaking at a press conference Anjan spoke on this issue in scathing words and said, “These advertisements are ridiculous, as they are promoting the innocent babies to do excessive susu. And the worst part is that a lot of fabric and cloth becomes dirty and is wasted because the mothers of these babies try to keep them clean even when they are not wearing diapers. I am strictly against dirtying of any kind of fabric in this country, be it normal fabric or moral fabric.”

He further continued, “You can call us Marxists, Leninists, Communists, Illusionist, Machinist, Pianist whatever but we believe in welfare of all people, except people in Nandigram. They are not even “people”, I believe. So when we care for people so much then we are the ones who will decide how many milligrams of susu and potty will each person in out rule, release every day, especially the babies. We the communists actually control the urine cycle of babies and it’s high time diaper companies stop interfering with that.”

He was later seen severely scolding people who were queuing outside the men’s restroom after the press conference concluded.

While diaper companies and central government have not replied to Anjan’s sharp accusations, Anjan is taking this campaign even a step further. He has decided to visit each and every household in West Bengal and coach the babies of that household on effective susu practices.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/atul-anjan-18.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/atul-anjan-now-targets-diaper-commercials-says-they-promote-excessive-susu-tendency-in-babies-8355,"Atul Anjan now targets diaper commercials, says they promote excessive susu tendency in babies",,1441514120.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“Modi government had chosen Janmashtami to announce OROP, instead of Eid. This shows the state of minorities in Modi’s India”, remarked a famous Adarsh Liberal.

Talking at a press meet convened immediately after the announcement of OROP (One Rank, One Pension), Congress leader Anant Shawarma hit out at the Modi’s tactics of releasing OROP with Bihar elections in mind.

“Modi’s government is not really for the welfare of the people. They only think about their profits from every policy decisions. Every big announcement is made before an election, so that they can garner votes. If we ban elections in India for next 4 years, then, no big laws or policies will be introduced by this government. This is just an election chasing government. Army veterans should not think that Modi government is with them. They are just pawns for winning Bihar elections,” he said.

“Whatever they may do, BJP will surely lose Bihar elections, because our Madamji is always in the heart of Indians, especially Biharis,” intervened Divgijay Snigh.

“It seems there is an RSS hand in the announcement of OROP. RSS met BJP recently and BJP comes with this announcement. Seems RSS wants to win the allegiance of army soldiers and later form an army to bring terror to the people here,” he added.

Kipal Salib said, “Who said Congress rejected OROP? It was rejected by Antony. He is not Congress. Sirf Madamji aur uska beta Congress hain. Rahul’s granny Indiraji removed OROP, because armymen not really wanted OROP. But, Congress always wanted to provide something to them. We tried to bring it in Rajivji’s government, but he instead came up with ‘One Tank, One Mansion’.

“So, we were waiting for Rahulji to become PM and bring back OROP. But, Indian voters betrayed us. They chose Modi instead. We were under the impression that Modi government will not implement OROP and we were using our insiders within BJP, to achieve that.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/revealed-nitish-kumar-sent-arvind-kejriwal-back-to-delhi-citing-teen-tigada-kaam-bigada-as-reason-8352,"Patna: In a bizarre turn of events, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar accompanied by Lalu Yadav has reportedly sent back Arvind Kejriwal to Delhi citing his belief in Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada superstition that discourages three people from discussing anything important together.

Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada

Nitish’s epiphanic moment came as a major surprise to Arvind Kejriwal who had planned to campaign door-to-door but was forced to take his trademark U-turn back to Delhi.

“AAP unit of Bihar had made all preparations for Kejriwals arrival including screening of latest movie, but with his return back to Delhi we have cancelled our door to door campaign,” said a party worker.

Lalu Prasad Yadav’s RJD that recently coalesced with the incumbent CM’s JD(U) was found to be the prime reason of Kejriwal’s return to Delhi.

As per our sources, Lalu was hurriedly walking towards Nitish to check if he’s coming online this afternoon. As he was fast approaching the CM, the latter had his epiphanic moment where he realized the long-standing superstition of Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada.

Here’s what seems to have gone through his mind:

“What if Lalu jinxes my chances to continue being the CM? What if Manjhi takes advantage of my weakness of believing in superstitions? He could even link it to the temple cleaning incident. I better send this guy back to Delhi. Jugaad can be planned on phone too. Whom to choose? Fodder? U-Turn? Fodder? U-Turn? I think I should make a move.”

Intellectuals believe Nitish should have asked Yo Yo Honey Singh to accompany Kejriwal to Patna as his presence would have added up the number of important people to 4.

Some AAP workers suggested that Kejriwal get Ashutosh along to add up people and thereby avoiding any jinx.

Others said that Nitish should’ve asked ministry officials to escort Kejriwal directly to a nearby multiplex for avoiding Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3idiots_1423053517-300x196.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/revealed-nitish-kumar-sent-arvind-kejriwal-back-to-delhi-citing-teen-tigada-kaam-bigada-as-reason-8352,"Revealed: Nitish Kumar sent Arvind Kejriwal back to Delhi citing ""Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada"" as reason",,1441429278.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An adamant Lalu Yadav speaking to the media and putting forth his demand for money

Not to be left behind, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has claimed his rightful Rs 4 lakh. Speaking to Faking News he said, “Nine children ka father hai hum, batao kitna paisa banta hai hamara. Dus lakh banta hai na. Hum Uddhav Thackeray sahab se request karta hu ki woh humko hamara paisa de.“

But Shiv Sena spokesperson has flatly refuted Lalu Yadav’s claim saying, “Our scheme is only valid for a family that has five kids, which are born between 2010 to 2015. Lalu Yadav doesn’t fit that criterion.”

BJP parliamentarian Sakshi Maharaj has welcomed this move of Shiv Sena and said, “I am very glad that Shiv Sena has set the threshold to 5 children. It is one more than the minimum-children (four) that a Hindu woman should have to protect Hinduism and Sanatan Dharma.”

Meanwhile, Mulayam Singh Yadav has raised doubts over this scheme and said it defies his logic. Speaking to party workers he said, “A man can never have four children from a single woman. It is not practical. This scheme is vague and purposeless. Since no one can ever have five children from a single wife, everybody will violate preconditions of this scheme.”

Experts are of the opinion that it is a politically motivated move by Shiv Sena and likely to cause polarization in Bihar before the assembly election. Sonia Gandhi has alleged and said, “Polarization is BJP’s masterstroke to win elections.”

She further added, “A Yale study confirms that my allegations are genuine.”

Lalu Prasad, however was adamant and said, “Either give me Rs 4 lakh or abort this scheme.”

VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi too had a few words to say. While supporting this scheme she said, “People who are opposing this scheme should go to Pakistan.”

Lalu’s demand on this issue has given birth to another protest. Parents who have only four children born between 2010 to 2015, are now demanding that the applicability period of this scheme be extended by 9 months.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lalu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lalu-claims-rs-4-lakh-following-shiv-senas-announcement-of-rs-2-lakh-reward-for-every-hindu-family-which-has-five-children-8341,"Lalu claims Rs 4 Lakh following Shiv Sena's announcement of Rs 2 Lakh reward for every Hindu family, which has five children",,1441178495.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Hardik Patel gives 1 day ultimatum to IRCTC for his ticket reservation.

“Even after trying for 3 hours at a stretch I was not able to book 3 berths in 3rd AC. I was so fedup that I threw the laptop in the flames of the bus which our brothers had just burnt,” Hardik fumed in anger and told reporters. He further told reporters that he had to then book 3 business class airline tickets using his iPhone 6 using his platinum credit card.

After sipping his Diet-Pepsi he further threatened, “If IRCTC does not let me book tickets, I will ask my millionaire NRI Patel brothers to not invest in coal mines in India anymore. No investment, no workers, no coal, no rails. Further we will not even supply a single drop of milk to railways. Good luck to railway passengers with no cups of semi-cold tea-coffee during those long rail journeys.”

Hardik’s followers were apparently so outraged at his not getting a reservation at IRCTC website that they took out their anger on anything remotely related to websites and internet. They ended up ravaging 2 cyber-cafes, 3 laptop showrooms and 5 computer accessories shops where they burned numerous laptops, crushed hard-disks and even chewed LAN cables. No arrests however have been made in this case as yet.

However the repercussions of this incident were felt throughout the country. A lot of secular liberal political leaders have come in Hardik’s support after this incident. They have condemned IRCTC for depriving a poor minority of his rights to commute at reasonable prices and forcing him to travel business class.

While this is seen as a move to defeat BJP in Bihar, many anti-corruption crusaders who supported Kejriwal were disappointed by his move.

Kejriwal to Nitish, “You take this chair now, I will take your chair later.”

Our Investigation team seeks to expose the covert operation of Arvind Kejriwal in nabbing the famous corrupt Lalu and his new dost Nitish Kumar.

First, our investigation team tried to contact several important heads in AAP to find out the reason behind Kejriwal’s sudden friendship with Nitish-Lalu.

“Initially, I could not believe that our Kejriwalji was going to team up with Nitish-Lalu. We were anxious over how to take forward our anti-corruption movement. But, one of our members from the top brass who is in direct touch with Kejriwal cleared all our doubts. Kejriwal is on a secret operation to nab the duo. He will try and move closer to them and will win their confidence. And finally, he will go to the depth of the corruption and bring out the corrupt. Our Kejriwalji is more like Radhe of Wanted. He acted like a ruffian to bring the evil ruffians to jail, our leader will act as an ally of corrupt to send the corrupt behind bars,” said one leader from Delhi unit, on conditions of anonymity.

After gathering this explosive info, we then confirmed this with several other state unit leaders of AAP. Bihar unit leaders also sounded affirmative on this info.

One top leader of Bihar unit said, “This is a covert operation. I hope that you don’t publish this. First, Arvind will try to find out important contacts in the Nitish-Lalu duo’s camp. Then, he will track down the list of politicians and their benamis. Finally, all the routes of corrupt money will be traced and a big dossier will be prepared.”

“But we have planned to stay mum on the whole covert ops till the announcement of Bihar election results. By then, Kejriwalji would have defeated BJP in the elections. After the win, Kejriwal will expose the corruption history of Nitish and Lalu. Then, they will be sent to jail and Kejriwal will be coronated as CM of Bihar. He will be functioning as CM of both Bihar and Delhi.

This out-of-the-box blame follows after his weird explanation on their rejection of Indian sweets offered by BSF.

Nawaz disappointed with NSA lunch menu

The menu was made public by the government as soon as the talks were cancelled. To provide more information, it was a typical lunch menu with Cucumber-Onion Salad, choice of Roti/Naan, Dal Makhni, Mutter Paneer, Malai Kofta, Aloo-Dum Biryani, Chicken Biryani and Murg Musalam.

The famous dish often seen during Indo-Pak meetings: Kashmiri Pulao, was clearly missing this time.

Speculations are that India wants Pakistan to forget about Kashmir and doesn’t want to compromise on this at any cost.

Speaking to Faking News reporter, a security official said, “There was an exclusive, pre-defined agenda set for these talks and we wanted to do our best not to shift focus towards otherwise common diversions like Bollywood, cultural exchange, chaman ki aasha and so on.

Moreover, Sharif himself had revealed the secret of their diabetic condition recently. So, you tell me, what purpose would a sweet pulao offered to diabetic people serve?”

Reactions poured in from the Sharif camp as well. One of their officials said, “Deliberate omission of Kashmiri Pulao and at the same time, including Balochi Fried Rice is clearly a conspiracy to avoid the issue spanning over decades. Like we said earlier, we are doing our best in tackling terrorism. If you’re looking for proof, please check with the survey agency that has recently included Pakistan in world’s 100 safest places to stay.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,"New Delhi: The Indian Government’s enthusiasm in its foreign policy has prompted many developments. The most recent is a joint working group setup to do a feasibility study for a possible India-Pakistan Free Terrorist Agreement (FTA). Terrorism is becoming a global industry, and hence, the increasing world consensus is towards enabling free competition of terrorist organizations, without interference from governments. A slew of allegations from both sides on anti-competitive terrorist practices is believed to be the main reason behind this development. An FTA with Pakistan would mean that terrorism will have open borders. The Indian side is represented by the Indian Insecure Mujahidin (IIM), while Taliban-ka-Baap (TKB) is the chief negotiator from Pakistan’s side.

India’s concerns

As per “terror-leaks”, certain confidential documents highlight concerns raised by India’s chief negotiator on good and bad terrorism. India is particularly concerned about the recent quality of terrorism exported from Pakistan into India. On the issue of Naved, who was recently caught by India in Udhampur, India’s chief negotiator lamented, “We are really concerned about the quality of terrorists imported from Pakistan. They are turning out to be plain duds, and spoil the image of all of us. They take all the limelight and credit too. The Indian terrorist ecosystem has just begun to evolve, and the domestic terrorist industry must be protected. We find it hard to compete with the buffoonery of Pakistani terrorists. Too much unnecessary heropanti. ”

The Indian side has hinted that they will undertake activities to sabotage Pakistani terror’s India expansion plans. Sources have revealed that the major method of doing so would be by secretly infiltrating the Pakistani terrorist supply chain. Once done, Pakistani terrorists will be unknowingly supplied fake grenades, AK-47 pichkaris, maps with Afghanistan labelled as India, and exploding walkie-talkies. The IIM representative feels that though this is an unfair move, it is an opportunity for IIM terrorists to become martyrs (they will die laughing).

Pakistan’s concerns

The Pakistani side, on the other hand, raised the issue of domestic market saturation. Too many terrorists and too many terrorist activities are forcing the terrorism behemoth to focus on export-led growth. They also feel that saffron groups & Maoists are increasingly taking centre stage in the media.

“We know that we are the best. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Just look at what e-Commerce is doing to the retail industry. We are slowly becoming a commodity. We want to constantly innovate to maintain our leadership – both in the media, and on the stupidity scale,” reasoned the TKB representative.

Global terrorist agreements

Amidst the ongoing negotiation is the threat of a mega free terrorist pact that ISIS is negotiating with various other countries like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. IIM claims that infrastructure bottlenecks and old video technology has rendered them uncompetitive compared to ISIS and the government should provide some domestic support (read subsidies) to the domestic industry. This is expected in the form of HD cameras, as well as English classes. The All India Terrorist Association (AITA) in a representation to the GOI has expressed its concern over the “huge capacity overhang” in ISIS which could “kill” Indian industry.

They have also highlighted that apart from ISIS, India also faces stiff competition from Pakistan and should get a level playing field in order for them to compete with Pakistan as they receive around 30% of their GDP as subsidies from the Pakistani government while in India this number is 0.

The Indian government has said that they are “sympathetic” towards the concerns of the industry but now the Indian domestic industry should get ready for reduced tariff lines and high quality imports of “good terrorist” into India as the free terrorists pacts are a reality. The protectionist policy of the previous government will not be tolerated by the new government.

A new era of competitive terrorism

We hope that unlike Free Trade pacts, India does not lose out in terms of negotiations of Free Terrorist Agreement. Many experts have highlighted the India’s “terrorist” deficit has increased fourfold in the past decade and Indian domestic industry has suffered on this count. So the endeavour should be to “Make in India” rather import into India.

AITA, has also said that it will also align itself to the “Skilling India” campaign so as to promote domestic skill development and ensure employability of fresh terrorists. A phased introduction of the FTA would ensure that the domestic industry has a chance to develop itself, and not to always be a cry-baby.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sartaz_aziz-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,Talks begin on the India-Pakistan FTA (Free Terrorist Agreement),,1440305755.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taking-support-from-aap-is-against-our-political-dna-senior-rjd-leaders-warn-lalu-8306,"Patna: In the quest to stay relevant in Bihar politics, Lalu Prasad Yadav faces the dilemma of his life. On one hand are the people who devotedly supported his every act of crime and corruption even when courts convicted him. On the other hand he has self-styled anti-corruption flagbearer Arvind Kejriwal, who according to media reports is ready to take the anti-corruption movement in Bihar by campaigning for RJD.

Both began as anti-corruption crusaders and then…

This news has put the second layer of RJD leaders in spot. They are at loss of words to explain the core voters whether the party stands for corruption or against it. With the leadership getting confused and core voters getting disillusioned there is a growing fear of revolt in the ranks sooner or later.

Pappu Yadav, an RJD leader who is accused in multiple scams and murders openly questioned Lalu, “Joining hands with Nitish Kumar, who beat us black and blue in last state election, may still not hurt RJD’s political DNA. But how do we explain our voters about getting support from AAP? AAP takes pride in being against corruption and we do exact opposite. We all have seen the big banners in Delhi that say Kejriwal has reduced corruption in Delhi. If he does the same here, what will our kids eat? Lauki?”

Sensing the growing discomfort in party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav called on Nitish Kumar to ensure that AAP is kept away from campaigning in 100 seats that RJD’s is fighting.

Meanwhile AAP supporters are not much bothered about Kejriwal’s decision to support an alliance comprising of RJD and Congress, two parties which were considered full of corrupt and criminals respectively.

“At least he is doing something. What is Modi doing except travelling abroad and taking selfies? Since Kejriwal has not kept any portfolio with him and Modi is not letting him do any other work, he is reviewing movies to kill time.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,"Mumbai: A day after Mulayam Singh said that it was ‘practically not possible for four men to rape a woman’, Valmiki Gopal, also known as ‘The Mumbai Masturbator’ has sought a certificate of innocence from Mulayam Singh.

Certificate of Innocence

Speaking to Faking News from Mumbai he said, “All I did was masturbate and we all do that, albeit discreetly. But look how the media is painting me as a villain. I can’t believe I am living in the same country, where in one state the authorities are defending the rapists while in another the CM is swiftly taking action against me for masturbating in broad daylight.”

“I was humiliated on social media with my pic going viral. I was not given a chance to explain my position. No one calls me by my real name now. They all call me ‘mumbai masturbator’. My reputation is tarnished, so I seek an ‘innocence certificate’ from Mulayam Singh,” he said.

Valmiki was also dejected with the attitude of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis for initiating swift police action.

“I just took a ‘hard stand’ against the porn ban and decided to protest in my way. This government is not allowing peaceful protests now. I think emergency days are back,” he added.

Apparently, Valmiki is planning to leave Mumbai for good and relocate to Uttar Pradesh. “No point staying here anymore. At least I can live with some respect and dignity in Uttar Pradesh. I am pretty sure Mulayam Singh won’t treat me like this if I feel like masturbating there. I have spoken to few people from UP who were accused of rape and they said, ‘koi tension wali baat nahi bhaiyyaji naam se hi nahi kaam se bhi mulayam hai’.”

When FN tried to contact Samajwadi Party spokesperson for their response on Valmiki Gopal’s request, the spokesperson acknowledged that they had indeed received a request from the aforementioned person.

“We are looking into the matter. Mulayamji has to look into the practicalities of the situation before taking any decision. Next week he will be handing out innocence certificates to rape convicts, probably he will give an official statement then,” said the spokesperson.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ceritficate-of-innocence.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,Mumbai masturbator seeks 'Innocence Certificate' from Mulayam Singh,,1440058980.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The stalemate between the Govt and students at FTTI prompted Arvind Kejriwal to use this opportunity to teach the students intricacies of film making.

Speaking to Faking News from New Delhi, the AAP chief said, “It’s not a case of political opportunism, I am deeply concerned about the future of the students at FTII. If these students don’t get the right environment to study, we’ll have mindless movies flooding the market. AAP has all the resources to start a Film Insititute here in Delhi. Our own party workers have hands on experience in drama and will form the core faculty.”

When questioned about the name of the institute he replied, “We are planning to name the institute as AAP Institute of Drama Study (AIDS). Our first institute will be located in Delhi and later we intend to spread AIDS across the country.”

Our sources within the party tell us that AAP leader Ashutosh with take up session on drama and the teach students how to emote in front of the camera while Kumar Vishwas will take session on make-up and beauty.

Students will also be shown audio-visuals of Parliament sessions to help them understand the nuances of drama.

As part of their summer projects, the students will be creating ads for the party and the best ad will get a chance to be featured on TV channels. Arvind Kejriwal will himself review all summer projects, like he has done with the release of Bollywood movies on Friday.

Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami has also been roped in as guest faculty.

FTII students too are happy. Rakesh Kumar, who joined FTII in 1992 said, “I my 23 years as a student at FTII, I have never witnessed something like this before, referring to the FTII deadlock. I don’t want to waste any more years as a student and hence I am planning to join AIDS.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kejri.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-launches-his-own-film-institute-says-will-teach-students-the-intricacies-of-drama-8298,"Arvind Kejriwal launches his own film institute, says 'will teach students the intricacies of drama'",,1439973924.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

PM Modi pointing towards a location on the map, giving an indication about his next trip.

According to Mr. Patra, “When Amazon or Flipkart advertise for a mega sale, people rush to buy as if there is no tomorrow. They never give a thought whether the product they are buying will be of any use or not. The other day one of my esteemed colleague working in a startup bought 4 pairs of black leather shoes and 6 pairs of Peter England shirts and formal trousers.”

While explaining frequent overseas visits by the PM, he said, “Modiji has travelled across whole world to bring laurels for the country. Because of these trips it’s natural, you will get good amount of frequent flyer air miles. May be many are not aware of this, these air miles will expire by end of this month as festival season is starting from next month and airlines expect occupancy rate to go up and they do not have to give too many freebies.”

Mr. Patra added, “I am confused, what is the problem if someone is redeeming those miles to make short trips like UAE one which our PM did recently. Though he did not speak, he was present in India when parliament session was going on. He conserved his energy to give us a speech to remember from Red Fort on Independence Day. After that went abroad only for 2 days and immediately back to his business. I find it strange, instead of appreciating this, some are criticizing.”

Mr. Patra told our reporter, “Most of us know this, and still let me clarify once more. Frequent flyer air miles can be used to access the airport lounge, upgrade the travel class and so on. These things are anyway available free for PM of any country. The major cost is the ticket cost for which some of the tax payers are complaining. For UAE trip the full ticket cost we saved by redeeming the miles. Still we have enough miles to arrange one free trip to Bhutan.”

When we asked Mr. Patra about the complaints by opposition he said, “They should be the last people to complain about our tax payer’s money. Because of them complete monsoon session was a wash out. They have no Idea, UN has made our PM as the ambassador for their new tourism initiative called Incredible World.”

Mr. Dhananjay Jha of Congress has criticized BJP spokesperson’s statement that they have no Idea. Mr. Jha told us, “As usual BJP is once again wrong with the facts. I have three connections of Idea, so many from my party use Idea phone, even Rahulji is using Idea phone for accessing IIN service. I would urge my close friend Mr. Patra for whom I have highest regard to do his homework properly before commenting on Congress party.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/modi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/do-not-complain-if-you-have-no-idea-modi-is-doing-short-trips-like-uae-one-to-redeem-the-air-miles-before-they-expire-bjp-spokesperson-8296,"Do not complain if you have no Idea, Modi is doing short trips like UAE one to redeem the air miles before they expire: BJP spokesperson",,1439968657.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mayawati: She intends to meet all statues in UAE to understand their problems and appeal to UAE govt to allot some land in the country where her tallest statue can be built.

Mulayam Singh Yadav: He would hold meeting with opposition parties in UAE for a possible third front alliance in India to stop communal forces from winning more elections. It will be called ‘Great Grand Alliance’ or ‘Ultra Janta Parivaar’.

Sharad Pawar: He will further strengthen his secular credentials by meeting Sheikhs and learning about their lifestyle, bank accounts and way they control natural resources.

Arvind Kejriwal: After waiving electricity bills for defaulters in Delhi, Kejriwal with an eye on 2019 Lok Sabha elections now intends to win over hearts of NRIs in UAE and will therefore demand waiver of their electricity and water bills from UAE govt.

Vasundhra Raje: With Rajasthan Cricket Association suspended by BCCI to host any IPL matches, Raje would ask UAE govt to let Rajasthan Royals hosts matches there. She will however deny that this demand has got anything to do with Lalit Modi.

Rahul Gandhi: He intends to go there and gatecrash random Indian households to have dinner with them. He will further even ask for more salaries to be given to NRIs working under Adani. However for the sake of Muslim vote bank in India, he will refrain from doing women empowerment there.

Jayalalitha: She will go on a study tour the jails of UAE and would implement the same facilities back in jails of Tamil Nadu, since she is quite a regular visitor there.

Nitish Kumar: The CM of Bihar not satisfied with just 50 lakh samples collected from Bihar, will go to UAE and cut nails and hair of NRI biharis and Biahri laborers to send them for a DNA test.

Raj Thackeray: If Biharis in UAE refuse to part with their hair and nail, Raj Thackeray currently free from any political responsibility (and perpetually free from any sensible responsibility) will help Nitish, along with MNS workers, in getting those samples collected from Biharis.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/modi-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/following-modis-demand-for-temple-kejriwal-rahul-gandhi-nitish-etc-make-more-demands-to-uae-8289,"Following Modi's demand for Temple; Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, Nitish etc make more demands to UAE",,1439801601.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

He has clarified during multiple press conferences that he is the only one who should be provided sole rights of interfering in education of the masses. Faking News met this seemingly old but young at heart economist for a brief interview.

Kartavya Sengupta explains why only he should be allowed to interfere in academics (Resemblance to Amartya Sen is purely coincidental)

Faking News Reporter: Nomoshkor Kartavya dada.

Kartavya Sengupta: Oh Please, call me KS.

FN Reporter: Ok Mr. KS, so let’s get started. What do you feel about the role of government in education?

KS: I feel bad about it. I think education is being saffronized.

FN Reporter: Saffronized?

KS: Yeah, the other day I was passing by a school and kids were tearing each other’s notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Oh?

KS: Yeah and those notebook covers were saffron in color? Can anyone explain that?

FN Reporter: Perhaps that was just a color, perhaps there were other covers also with other colors.

KS: No, I just saw the school kids tearing covers and all of them were saffron. It is clear saffronization. And one thing is clear the kids, the students, they don’t like this saffronization. They just hate it.

FN Reporter: How do you know that they hate it?

KS: That’s the reason why they were tearing the covers. They hate the saffronization. They want the liberal thought. That tearing of notebook covers was an expression of angst among youth of this country.

FN Reporter: Oh come’on, this is a very weak argument?

KS: Ah you are calling my argument weak? Don’t you know that I am the Argumentative Indian?

FN Reporter: Well. I don’t mean ….

KS: No, I don’t blame you, I can see you are wearing a saffron kurta yourself.

FN Reporter: But this is off-white.

KS: Off-white? Perhaps, but there is a tinge of saffron in it at least to me it appears saffron.

FN Reporter: Did you have a color recognition problem ever in your life?

KS: Well at times yeah, I think things are saffron but they turn out to be white or dim yellow. I don’t know. But I still think those kids need saffron-neutral notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Let’s talk about your thoughts on economics.

KS: Oh please don’t get me started on how big of a consumer surplus are we missing out because of current government’s policies.

FN Reporter: But don’t you think by encouraging people to leave subsidies the government is cutting down on the subsidy wedge and in fact increasing the total societal benefit?

KS: Oh please don’t go to those demand supply curves. They are out with Keynes and his ilk. The obfuscation of prerogative rights to ‘denormalized’ priorities over geopolitical manifestations of ‘conglomeraticious’ designs is an apostle to the fact that the notion of utopia of equality has busted long back in time.

FN Reporter: I didn’t quite understand your last sentence.

KS: Hmm you haven’t read my books, I guess.

FN Reporter: Well, I tried to but there were some words I couldn’t even find in the Oxford dictionary, so after 4-5 pages I gave up.

KS: [Smiles] Yes, I take that as a compliment. The next guy who finishes reading up my book may even get a Nobel.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-flags-waived-in-delhi-stadium-old-srinagar-on-independence-day-fir-registered-8284,"Srinagar/Delhi. Indian flags were hoisted by some miscreants in two separate incidences in Delhi and Srinagar this afternoon. This is for the first time this year when Indian flags were hoisted in any rallies in both places, shocking the entire nation.

In Delhi, eyewitnesses told Faking News that soon after student were made to display the name of Mr. Fakriwal on placards in a stadium, clashes broke out between Mr. Fakriwal’s supporters and another group.

During the clashes, some youth, who were wearing masks and called themselves “patriots”, waved the Indian flag in the same stadium where the ceremony was on to felicitate Mr. Fakriwal for getting Delhi independence.

“How dare they! This is terrorism!” one Fakriwal supporter told this reporter, talking about attempts of the patriot group to unfurl Indian flag inside the stadium.

Instead of high flying name of a messiah, the sight of flying tricolor shocked many.

Soon afterwards, large posters across Delhi were put up blaming PM directly for this incidence. The posters mentioned “Pradhanmantri Sir! Plij! Hame placard lagane dijiye! Ham theek placard lage rahe hain.”

Ms. Falka Lamba (Chief Investigator of Mr. Fakriwal’s party and world record holder for the fastest healed head injury) said that they have started the investigations into the matter.

“Yes, a flag was hoisted by some youth inside the premises of this stadium and we are checking the video footage to identify which flag it was. We have registered an FIR with our internal police and are investigating. I will personally look into the matter and will throw away the billing machine ermm, I mean flag if I ever find it,” she said.

A subordinate of Mrs. Lamba, Asutosh showed confidence in Mrs. Lamba’s abilities and said, “Madam pakad lengi un atankiyon ko, kanoon ke hath bahut Lamba hote hain.. hehe“

The Delhi police is also investigating the Delhi incidence. It has been attempting to decipher the real meaning of Indian flags being waved at a stadium where felicitation for Mr. Fakriwal was going on.

According to preliminary reports, these patriotic groups were fed up of what they termed as narcissism and hypocrisy of Mr. Fakriwal, but such reports were rejected as “paid” by many commentators in media.

Indian flag was also waved in parts of Kashmir today, however Kashmir government spokesperson denied the presence of patriots in the state.

“You have to understand that no patriot has been identified so far in the valley. The flag of India was waved by some pandits who crossed the border and infiltrated from Jammu,” he told reporters.

But many Human Rights activists have condemned the incident.

“All our fears are coming true under Modi rule, not surprised at all this has come down to this,” Saakar Patel, part of Damnasty international told Faking News referring to the attack on local culture in Jammu & Kashmir.

“What next? Loud patriotic songs and Krantiveer on loop on local cable TVs in epicenteres of secularism? Is that the future we are heading too?” he asked with angst.

Dr. Amartya Sen, talking about these incidences on a panel discussion on TV said that the message is to threaten the very ideas of free thought and humanity and its terror attacks (Indian flag hoisting in this case) can not be tolerated in any civilized liberal society.

Dr. Sen further added, “Ethical hypocrisy is not an intellectual construct the ideologically minded understand and tolerate well, but honest duplicity is the essence of modern liberalism and we must protect it at any cost.”

We are still trying to figure what Dr. Sen said at the time of publishing this report.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tricolor-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-flags-waived-in-delhi-stadium-old-srinagar-on-independence-day-fir-registered-8284,"Indian flags waved in Delhi stadium & old Srinagar on Independence Day, FIR registered",,1439651047.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

PM Modi checking the coin in his pocket for the Coin Toss session

Speaker today announced that instead of a regular session, the Parliament will have a special ‘Coin Toss session’

Speaking to Faking News a senior BJP MP said, “The way opposition parties are behaving, I don’t think we can get any work done in winter session. So we have are planning to toss coin in the Parliament and then accept or reject bills in a single go. A special session is scheduled tomorrow and luckily since PM Modi is also in the country, we are hoping that the will start the session by the first coin toss by the PM himself.”

“I think we are entering a new era of Parliamentary discussions where time is of essence and such innovative practices are the need of the hour,” said Speaker of the Parliament as he gave the green signal for the coin to be flipped.

Our sources who were present in the Parliament said that PM Modi tossed the coin up and no sooner it started falling, Rahul Gandhi screamed saying ‘Rupee is falling, the economy is in bad shape. PM must answer. PM must resign’. And there was ruckus in the Parliament once again.

APP leader Kejriwal too jumped on a chance to criticize the government. “So much black lying outside the country and Modiji is tossing coins. I request Modiji to get all the coins that are lying in swiss bank accounts first,” he said while simultaneously replying to Ashutosh’s query on the number of zeros in 10 Cr.

Following the chaos, Speaker decided to adjourn the Parliament for another 2 hours

Meanwhile, Arnab Goswami thundered at the way Parliament functioned when it came to discussion on crucial bills and criticized MPs for the ‘coin toss’ session.

“It is the same story every session. Like every Shahrukh Khan movie, our Parliament too has nothing new to offer. Sambit Patra, I am asking today, is this a cricket match that you will toss the coin and make decisions. I want you to apologize to the people of the country,” screamed Mr. Goswami as Sambit Patra was seen stuffing his ears with cotton.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/modi-speaker-parliament1_0_0_0-300x181.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/six-bills-to-be-passed-in-remaining-days-of-winter-session-govt-to-toss-coin-and-decide-8677,"Six bills to be passed in remaining days of winter session, Govt. to toss coin and decide",,1450776129.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Azad’s nephew (Name withheld for safety reasons) has thanked his uncle for blaming hackers for the tweet in question and not his nephew, as is the standard practice.

Kirti Azad feeling happy after blaming the hackers

Late last night, Kirti Azad tweeted that many agencies have asked him to take precaution against threat to his life. He later tagged Arun Jaitley in the tweet and said that he isn’t afraid of napunsaks. However, he issued a clarification shortly after that his account was hacked and he didn’t tweet that.

Speaking to Faking News, an elated Kirti Azad’s nephew said, “I really can’t tell you how relieved I am. When I saw the tweet calling Mr Jaitley a napunsak from his handle, I knew the blame is going to fall on me. Ever since Raina brought nephews to mainstream, we are the bali ka bakra for every offensive tweet, sometimes for scams too. Thankfully, my panic was shortlived. Within half an hour, he put the blame squarely on hackers.”

When we asked him whether he believes his uncle’s version of account hacking, the newphew laughed and said, “Who will hack my uncle’s account yaar. Nobody even paid attention to his rants on DDCA for years till Kejriwal brought media attention with him. Politics is all about making false promises and blaming others when you screw things up. It was obvious he was going to blame his act on someone, luckily, he blamed it on the hackers.”

Meanwhile, as per sources, nobody in BJP is buying the hacking theory since the tweet in question was still not deleted when reports last came in. Senior BJP leadership has even asked Javed Akhtar to delete Kirti Azad’s tweet looking at his expertise in deleting others tweets.

While speaking to the media at a press conference, the AAP leader said, “After thousand tweets and countless media briefings I have absolutely no doubt that the CBI is convinced and is now under our control. Soon the truth about the case will be in public and Jaitleyji also knows that. I have come to know from my sources that he (Arun Jaitley) will wear the santa outfit and move around Delhi to give CBI the slip. He is also planning to move all documents and incriminating evidence in the santa bag, so that no one suspects.”

AAP leaders have also said that they are not going to be fooled by this ‘fancy dress’. Apparently, AAP volunteers will be out on the streets in an attempt to catch the FM red handed.

Party member Kumar Vishwas said, “If Mr. Jaitley can dress up as Santa, hum bhi kuch kam nahi. Most AAP members will be patrolling the streets, especially on Christmas Eve. I am planning to dress up like Cindrella and Ashutosh as Batman. We won’t let Mr. Jaitley get away so easily.”

BJP has called Arvind Kejriwal’s statement as blasphemous, preposterous, sacrilege, farcical and similar other words that need a quick glance at the dictionary.

“Arvind Kejriwal is getting hysterical. Our party will strongly protest against his statement that Mr. Arun Jaitley will be dressing as Santa. I mean, does he even look like a Santa.

Cancel your flight tickets if you plan to travel on 18th December 2015

The CEO of Flying Monkey airlines that is well renowned for offering air travel in INR 99 (excluding everything) spoke to faking news that, “We respect Rohit Shetty’s talent. He makes up for the shortcomings in the story by making his cars achieve unimaginable altitudes. When his last movie was released our flight no. Airbus 420 headed towards Jhumari Talliya avoided collision with one of his flying Scorpio car at 35000 altitiude. This time as it is SRK movie car may go still higher and so we are not taking any chances. After the film is released and altitude and trajectory of each of his flying car is calculated and mapped then only we will resume our operations. Meanwhile we will sell tickets for INR 9 to many remote destinations for the year 2098.”

One stuntman from Rohit Shetty’s team revealed that this time they have fitted the cars with altimeters so after the first show of the movie they are going to send the altitude data for each of the flying cars ISRO and all the airline companies so they can manage their operations accordingly.

One of the award returnees defended the flying cars by saying, “Look the parking has become so intolerant that cars cannot stay and have to fly. I will definitely return my ‘Moron of the year award’.”Whereas one Delhi resident is confused about the odd- even rule as whether it is applicable to travelling cars on road or applicable to flying cars as well.”

Kejriwal showing signs of relief after the choke was cleared and he could finally use the washroom

Most of the leading media houses ignored this piece of news as they wanted to maintain their ‘integrity’. They knew this is something their journalists cannot access and verify.

According to our sources Arvind Kejriwal has proved once again that he is right. The Aam plumber which came on short notice after getting a call from Delhi secretariat found the choke in CM’s room has actually originated from PM’s room.

The Aam plumber (who did not want to be named) told us, “Sir, I am doing maintenance work in Delhi secretariat for last twenty years, never seen such a major choke. CM’s room has a dedicated line as we cannot mix CM’s line with any other line coming from other ministers or bureaucrats room. Similarly my colleague working on PMO also confirmed PM’s room has separate connection. All these VVIPs connections are connected in such a way that regular maintenance is easy. These VVIP connections are covered under a separate tender so that it can be awarded to one company so that its maintenance remains hassle free and quick.”

Aam plumber added, “Unlike us, VVIPs cannot use other’s washroom due to security reasons. No we have technology to find out where is the root cause of the choke. Within a minute I could trace that choke has started from PM’s room which is just 7 kilometer away. My guess this choke might have started sometime back, as PM is not using it regularly due to his frequent on-site trips, he might not have noticed it.”

The aam plumber said, “I have never seen Kejriwal sir so angry. Not only he called PM psychopath, after finding the reason behind the choke he called PM is anti-naturopath. He is taking naturopathy medicines to keep his body and mind clean and for that he visits the washroom frequently. Today he had to block everything for hours.”

“I have seen he will wash his hand after every tweet and will tell Manishji loudly ‘I have washed my hand off this tweet’. Today for a change he did series of tweets without taking a break when I was doing my duty,” he added.

“I do my job honestly so that my boss remains happy all the time. He has assured me a 400% hike from next year. Now I am checking if I can separate out PM’s line from our CM’s line. Last year CM’s line was separated from Lieutenant Governor’s office room line,” aam plumber said, hoping to get a salary hike.

“Another point to note unlike other VVIPs, our CM allows aam public like Kumar Vishwasji to use his washroom. As Kumarji is neither an MLA nor MP right now, sir allows him to use whenever he visits him and also whenever sir will go out of station he will give the key to Kumarji. I have seen Kumarji will sit inside for hours to write his Kavita,” concluded the aam plumber.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejri-releif.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwals-office-washroom-choked-plumber-traces-the-choke-to-pms-office-8661,"Kejriwal’s office washroom choked, plumber traces the choke to PM’s office",,1450335637.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Arvind Kejriwal asking the CBI to do a small favor and give intimation before conducting raids

He further cautioned all national security agencies to not dare to raid AAP controlled territories without 2 week prior notice and mandatory permission from Kejriwal himself.

Addressing media persons after a dharna rally he angrily questioned, “Yaar ye CBI waale hote kaun hai? Who are they to do that? What jurisdiction do they have in AAP ruled territories? In AAP’s controlled lands AAP is Judge, AAP is Jury and AAP is jallaad. They should understand AAP’s internal laws. Any government does not have any right to interfere in AAP’s internal legal processes. AAP’s internal lokpal’s decision would be full and final in AAP ruled territories.”

Pointing fingers towards camera Kejriwal again fumed in anger, “Going forward AAP should be served atleast a two weeks prior notice before any national security agency even tries to set foot within 100 meters of any AAP controlled territories. If anyone is guilty in our lands we will tackle with them ourselves by our own rule of law. If we find someone innocent no other authority dare challenge us …. Laal Salaam.”

Kejriwal then left the venue in jiffy after which some of the supporters tried to burn CBI effigy, but since the effigy was doused in too much kerosene it burnt violently and clothes of some of the supporters also caught fire. No one however was reported hurt except Mr. Kejriwal’s ego.

Meanwhile, some less aggressive AAP members suggested that the party launch an app for CBI officials that will enable them to give intimation before conducting raids. “We don’t believe in just criticizing, but we are offering solution too. Our party will officially launch its app for that will benefit both the CBI and those who are under the scanner,” said a senior AAP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejriwal-cbi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/security-agencies-must-provide-2-week-prior-notice-before-raiding-aap-controlled-territories-kejriwal-8659,Security agencies must provide 2 week prior notice before raiding AAP controlled territories: Kejriwal,,1450255351.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Our party was celebrating the Bihar poll victory when this man came up on the stage and pulled me towards him and then hugged me. I can tell you I had no clue who this man was till today, when I saw that CBI officials had raided the secretariat.”

The Lalu-Kejriwal hug

CBI officials revealed that they are closely scrutinizing all that they have managed to gather from the raid and the image of Kejriwal and Lalu hug will be on the radar.

Rabri Devi too remembers the incident and said, “Yes, it’s true. I have seen this man walk up on stage and then suddenly without warning he pulled Laluji and hugged him. “Itni himmat toh laluji me bhi nahi hai, aaj tak unhone bhi mujhe iss tarah se kheech ke gale nahi lagaya.”

Sources close to Lalu Yadav say that the RJD Chief wants to ‘stay away from CBI’ and all such controversies that may even remotely tarnish the political career of his sons.

Apparently, he has sent a bouquet to PM Modi too and indirectly apologized for calling him ‘shaitaan’. “Name calling during election is common. You must have heard names likes shaitaan, chudail, bhrampishach etc being traded. But there is nothing personal and Laluji has respect for the PM,” said Tejasvi Yadav.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal who is rattled with the CBI raid, has cancelled all plans for the weekend.

“Arvindji was to attend the first day first show of SRK-Kajol starrer Dilwale. He had seen DDLJ with bhabhiji atleast 10 times when he was studying at IIT Delhi.

CBI has claimed to unearth a 370 pages proof against corruption of former Delhi Chief Minister and Congress leader Sheila Dixit in the Chief Minister’s Office during a raid on the premises earlier today, but the current Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has rejected that the “objectionable documents” were recovered from his office.

“Modi is scared of us and is engaging in such cheap tricks. The coward psychopath has planted such objectionable documents in my office,” Delhi CM Kejriwal declared when Faking News asked about CBI’s findings.

“Am I stupid to keep such documents in my office?” Kejriwal argued when asked about the documents recovered from this office.

When our reporter reminded him that these could be the same set of documents he had claimed to be possessing when he was an anti-corruption crusader who was not forcibly hugged by Lalu, Kejriwal claimed that there was an undeclared emergency in the country and Modi must be removed.

“I know what documents and files are in my office, and Modi is playing cheap tricks,” he later clarified, “Today it is documents against Sheila Dixit, tomorrow they will plant documents against Sonia Gandhi ji in National Herald case. Is this what people of this country want?”

Realizing that he has taken the name of Sonia Gandhi and National Herald in the same sentence, Kejriwal quickly added, “This government is more corrupt than any other government India had seen.” Soon after this, #CorruptModi was trending in India.

With Twitter trends threatening to disrupt parliament, CBI clarified that it had not raided the CM’s office but the office of his chief secretary, which is located in the same premises. “We found these documents in a dustbin outside the Chief Minister’s office,” a CBI officer claimed.

“Why is CBI looking into dustbins? Is this Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan? Will dustbins be emptied and garbage strewn around in the name of fighting corruption?

The place where Young India wants to be

As per the report, sarkari jobs which were till now looked down by many, are now ranked top preferred by most looking for professional qualification, especially being an MP.

The report says that the ‘No Work All Pay’ culture has attracted a lot of young Indian’s who don’t want to succumb to endless work pressure and would like to enjoy life instead.

Raunak Singh who works for an IT company in Bangalore and till few days back was planning to pursue MBA, has thrown away his CAT preparation books and is now devoting himself completely to politics spoke to our reporter and said, “As part of my current job in IT industry, I end up working for 14 hours every day. Not to mention the extra work I do on weekends and promotion chances are looking bleak this year too. I thought getting an MBA will change all that and probably help me command a higher pay.”

“But it seem like every Neil Nitin Mukesh is an MBA these days. Besides, look how much fun our MPs are having. All they do is scream in the Parliament and adjourn it, no attendance compulsory, weekends off, subsidized canteen food, no appraisal but still hike in salary. That too without having to slog for getting a professional degree,” he said even as he tied bundles of MBA preparation material, ready to be given to the raddiwala.

Report also elaborates on how CAT, the most popular competitive exam amongst college graduates has already lost its sheen. IIMs too have reported a drop in number of students. “There was a time a time when OB vans used to be parked outside CAT exam venues on last Sunday of every November. Just appearing the exam made you a half MBA, all that is gone now,” said an IIM aspirant, who has been trying to crack the exam for the last 10 years.

If Salman’s driver can do it, why cant’t my driver

Speaking at a national meet of the Congress party today, Ms. Gandhi said that Tadapit Kumar, Rahul and her driver of fifteen years, was the actual investor in National Herald and not the Gandhis.

“I want to confirm today that it was our driver, Tadapit-ji, who had given the Rs. 90 Crore loan to acquire a controlling stake in National Herald,” Mrs. Gandhi said, amid cheers and applause from the crowd of Congress party-men at the meet.”

“Tadapit-ji did so without informing Rahul or me, and his only mistake was that he happened to once share a cigarette with Mr. Subramanian Swamy’s driver, post which Mr. Swamy started falsely implicating us in this case,” she said.

“It is the intolerance of the Narendra Modi government that they are targeting innocent people like us, whose drivers happened to innocently invest 90 Crores in a company,” she continued.

Faking News in-house news analyst pointed out at the increasing number of instances where Drivers are ‘taking over’ the blame from their owners since Salman Khan was acquitted by the court.

Apparently, a few enterprising individuals have teamed up with these ‘happy to be fall guy’ drivers to start their own online blame taking venture. “It’s a lucrative market out there. So many cases and you know how the judiciary functions. By the time a criminal is convicted he is almost ready to die a natural death,” said a serial entrepreneur.

Meanwhile, Narayansamy spoke all out in support of the Gandhi family giving them a clean chit even before they appeared before the court. “It is a well known fact that ‘Rahul can do no wrong’. This is just another ploy by our opposition to tarnish the image of Rahulji,” said Narayansamy, with his hands still unwashed since the time he picked up Rahul Gandhi’s footwear.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/soniag.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/driver-invested-in-national-herald-without-telling-us-sonia-gandhi-8649,Driver invested in National Herald without telling us: Sonia Gandhi,,1449982387.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Congress spokesperson declared that they will disrupt court proceedings too if judiciary continues to show its arrogance.

Now get ready to see similar protest in court too

We won’t let the court function if it gives verdict against our leaders. We have successfully blocked both houses of parliament while having only 44 MP. What makes you think we can’t do the same to judiciary? Congress also accused high court of pursuing Legal Vendetta against Gandhis.

Why is court adamant on Gandhis being personally present during the proceedings? This is pure arrogance. If judges really want to see Sonia ji or Rahul ji, they can take the appointment and visit 10 Janpath, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said while checking Rahul Gandhi’s holiday calendar.

Shaitaan Khopdi™ tried to reason with Kharge by saying, ‘In a democracy, court is the supreme authority’. But Kharge was ready with the answer, ‘There should be reasonable restriction on judiciary’s adventurism. When it’s about Gandhi family, courts and democracy can wait. That has been the tradition since 1975. But during last 18 months old traditions have been thrown in the dustbin. Why so much arrogance and intolerance is being directed towards Congress?’

Reacting to the situation Rahul Gandhi said, “Justice is in my shirt, in my pant. In fact it used to be in my pocket till May 2014. We used to appoint judges on the cases related to us. This ‘Suit-Boot ki Sarkar’ is snatching everything away from people like us”.

When asked about his involvement in National Herald case, Gandhi replied, “We tried to revive a media house which was struggling to stay afloat. Is it something new we have done? So many media houses are surviving only because of our money. But why court is taking special interest in this case? That’s why I call it Politics of Vendetta.”

All this while national mainstream media was struggling to find news they can carry in order to avoid reporting on National Herald.

With no hearing lined up for either Indrani Mukharjea or IPL spot fixing cases it looked like they may have to betray Congress. But thankfully #SalmanVerdict arrived just in time leading to a big sigh of relief in news rooms and in 10 Janpath.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-mlas-propose-corruption-temptation-resistance-allowance-for-legislators-8644,"New Delhi: A group of Delhi MLAs from the Aam Aadmi Party, have suggested the creation of a new ‘corruption temptation resistance allowance’ (CTR allowance) to be given as part of the monthly salary of Delhi legislators.

Kejriwal lost in his own thoughts on ‘Corruption Temptation Resistance Allowance

They feel that the temptation to get involved in corruption is too high, given the position of power that they are in.

Speaking exclusively to faking news, Shri Praveen Kumar, AAP MLA from Jangpura, who was also part of the group that proposed the revolutionary 400% salary hike back in July 2015 said, “We are regularly meeting with industrialists, mediapersons, and others who are always willing to pay bribes for certain decisions. Until now we have clearly said no to such things. This has only been possible because of the high standards of AAP. But we are almost always in a situation where our minds and character can slip. Hence we feel that this is a very important step forward.”

He is part of the group of MLAs who has made this proposal.

On being asked for a comment, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of Delhi, had this to say, “I think this is a very novel idea to end the scourge of corruption. This was our promise and we will achieve the death of corruption at all costs. If after this also, any minister indulges in corruption then we will throw them out.”

He also added, “I think Mr. Modi also should get CTR allowance. When he meets Obamaji, he must be feeling embarrassed to admit that he never takes bribes unlike all other politicians.”

He was speaking on the sidelines of a function to felicitate Shri Praveen Kumar in the Jangpura mohalla sabha by its residents, for the hard work done by Shri Kumar.

Shri Kejriwal was invited as chief guest. When he was asked by a journalist on what he had to say on being caught napping in the assembly, he dismissed this accusation saying he was just meditating and trying to focus inward, after which he was able to concentrate completely on the proceedings of the Assembly.

On being questioned, whether there was any plan to hold a referendum on this issue, Kejriwal explained, “No there is no need for a referendum on this since I know the rhythm of the heartbeat of our people very well, I know the warmth of their every breath. I am familiar with the exact shade of redness of the blood that runs in their veins. When I was meditating for a couple of minutes in the assembly yesterday, I realized that we have the support of the entire population of Delhi and I am truly overwhelmed by their support”.

There was a hint of moistness in Shri Kejriwal’s eyes. The members of the press did not have any further questions to ask him.

The Assembly Speaker Shri Ram Nivas Goel has referred this proposal to an independent 3-member committee involving prominent persons of the citizenry of Delhi, with one retired judge of Delhi High Court and one person from the media.

The Chief Whip of Government of Delhi said that he was proud to be an AAP member today. “With respect to the CTR allowance proposal, my party unanimously requested Hon’ble Speaker to leave the matter entirely to a Committee of Experts to be constituted with outsiders as its Members. Hon’ble Speaker Shri Ram Niwas Goel accepted the request. Delhi is showing the way. For the second time in the history of independent India, I can proudly claim, the Delhi Assembly made this pioneering move aimed at restoring the credibility of elected representatives. It has voluntarily given up the constitutional and statutory privilege of fixing the salaries of MLAs on its own. I am sure and I hope it will inspire all the right thinking people to adopt course correction across the country. I congratulate the Chief Minister and the Delhi Government.”

Shri Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister, said while speaking on this bill in the Assembly, “This is a revolutionary bill which will end corruption once and for all. After this no sitting minister should have any hesitation in saying no to bribes. We propose a CTR allowance which will be 400% of the current gross salary of a member of legislature. This is very much needed to serve the people of this great city of Delhi more efficiently. We cannot deny the need for money when it comes to serving the people.”

“Currently we are not able to attend public gatherings like weddings and ribbon cutting ceremonies, for the fear of being tempted to accept bribes. Especially when we have visitors at home, I feel severly pressurized by my wife who keeps saying ‘Lelo, tumhara kya jaega? leke mujhe dedo, koi guilt feeling bhi nahi hogi tumhe’. This is an attempt to create an environment for the MLAs, in which they do not have to look for an alternative source of income,” added Shri Praveen Kumar.

Another MLA who did not wish to be named said “kya kare sir, sab log toh Kejriwal nahi bansakte hain na, chai pani ke liye kuch to karna padega.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kejri1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-mlas-propose-corruption-temptation-resistance-allowance-for-legislators-8644,Delhi MLAs propose 'Corruption Temptation Resistance Allowance' for legislators,,1449734775.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Meet AAP’s newest member, Bobby Jindal

Speaking to Faking News he said, “I realized that it isn’t really my time and by opting out of the 2016 presidential race I had just taken a u-turn. I am a Punjabi, felt like going back to India and being with ‘my people’. There couldn’t have been a better party than AAP for me to further my political ambition.”

Sources close to Bobby Jindal say that the ex-President hopeful has been feeling ‘home sick’ for quite some time and many saw his latest move coming. “He has been behaving a little weird lately. A few days back he was singing ‘chitti aayi hai’ at Times Square. The cops took him aside for questioning and only when he said that he was the Governor, did they let him off with a warning.”

AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal has welcomed Bobby Jindal’s decision to join the party and said, “So many people have left the party in the last few years that we were desperate for someone to join us. Arre Bobby Jindal kya, Agar Bobby Darling bhi hota toh hum usko party mein include karte.”

It is not clear when the formal announcement of Mr. Jindal’s induction will be made by the party but the spokesperson for the party says that its ‘work in progress’.

“We have asked Bobby Jindal to complete the joining formalities like submitting his last drawn salary slip, his original school and college leaving certificates. Once the documents are verified we will make a formal announcement,” said Raghav Chaddha, spokesperson for the party.

Former union minister and Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today stoked another controversy by reportedly saying, during a panel discussion on a Pakistani sports channel that MS Dhoni needs to be removed as Indian Cricket captain for Pakistan to beat India in a World Cup.

Pakistan has never managed to beat India in an ODI World cup in 6 attempts and it remains one of their major ambitions to beat India in a world cup game. Closest they came was in 2011 semifinal but then India was rescued by Misbah Ul Haq’s aggressive batting.

MS Aiyar thinking about his opening combination

When the anchor of Pakistani sports channel asked what is to be done to end this string of losses against India in the World Cup, Aiyar responded, “The first and the foremost thing is to remove Dhoni. Only then can the chances of a Pakistan win increase. We have to wait for four more years. You are all optimistic that Dhoni will retire by then but there has to be a more proactive approach than that.” He further said, “Bring me to the leadership and remove him. There is no other way to increase your chances. I will drop Virat, send Raina to face Mohammad Irfan, include Binny as the allrounder and will bowl Ishant Sharma at the death.”

When we sought his reaction to the issue, MS Dhoni said, “This is absolutely heartbreaking. After all that I have done for Chennai and Tamil Nadu, a Tamil guy approaching Pakistan to remove me is quite sad. At least he should have approached Sri Lanka.”

The matter has taken a political turn with BJP asking Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to clear their stand. In response, Congress has distanced itself from MS Aiyar’s remark and also shown footage of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi cheering for India during the aforementioned 2011 semifinal to clear any doubt.

Speaking to the media in Delhi, Mr Swamy challenged Rahul Gandhi to survive 24 hrs without having a single cup of tea in order to prove he isn’t a British national.

Can he resist this temptation?

Earlier on Monday, Mr Swamy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has claimed himself to be a British national before the authorities there and has demanded that he be stripped of Indian citizenship and Lok Sabha membership.

While Congress has rubbished these allegations, Mr Swamy says that burden of proof now lies with Rahul Gandhi and he must prove he is not a British citizen. Easiest way to do it is by going without tea for 24 hours.

Tea is widely considered to be the national love interest of Britain and an average Brit drinks about 3 and a half cups of tea every day. Dr Swamy argued that if he is British, he won’t be able to resist it for that long.

Speaking to the press, Mr Swamy said, “I have already given papers proving Rahul Gandhi is British. Now he must show that he isn’t a Brit by staying away from tea. However, this doesn’t mean that we accept him as an Indian citizen. For that, he will have to pee on the roadside and throw garbage out of his moving car.”

As per our sources inside BJP, BJP has already prepared a grand strategy to foil Rahul Gandhi’s tea fast if he accepts the challenge. A NaMo tea stall has already opened outside Rahul Gandhi’s residence at Tughlak lane. There are also plans to invite him to a Chai pe charcha with the Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi to debate national issues. If Mr Gandhi turns down this invite, BJP plans to celebrate it as a moral victory and if he accepts, his British citizenship may get confirmed.

Meanwhile, Mr MS Aiyar responded to Mr Swamy’s challenge by saying, “These chaiwallahs can’t think beyond tea. I told you a chaiwallah shouldn’t become the PM.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rahul-gandhi-kedarnath-trek-having-tea_650x400_71429870327-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/swamy-challenges-rahul-to-go-without-tea-for-24-hrs-to-prove-he-isnt-british-8579,Swamy challenges Rahul to go without tea for 24 hrs to prove he isn’t British,,1447748178.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A fan’s representation of the upcoming Rahul Gandhi live

An honest revelation from the senior leader confirmed that idea of ‘Rahul Gandhi Live’ was an inspiration drawn from prime minister’s recent speech at Wembley stadium in the United Kingdom.

Venue of the live event was supposedly decided based on Rahul’s choice. As per sources, Digvijay is believed to have instructed party’s event management team to book Bangkok’s Rajamangala stadium for the event.

Speaking to Faking News, Digvijay said, “Rahul ji has a huge task of carrying the flag of anti-incumbency while leading from the front for 2019 elections. We have chosen Bangkok for his inaugural speech so that he gets the much needed relaxation before his discourse.”

Meanwhile, noted journalist Sagarita Gose seemed quite happy with Congress’ move and she said, “Whatever it maybe for Congress, it is going to be a juxtaposing exercise for me, yet again! Will be happy to analyze the event and give my expert opinion on it.”

While we were leaving, we heard Rahul practicing his speech which gave us a feeling that “RaGa Live” was around the corner. Here’s what we could interpret from his moments of soliloquy.

“The color of coconut from inside is the color of dress we wear. As Congress party, we are free and fair in all our aspects. The towel used in massage parlor is white too. This is where we see a unison of our cultures,” said Rahul as he stared at himself in the party office mirror.

——– Below is the selected transcript, as it happened in 221B Baker Street (Sherlock’s residence) at 6:07 AM (local time) on Friday: ——–

Modi: Hello Sherlock, let me introduce my self, I am…

SH (Sherlock Holmes): Wait.. Wait.. Let me guess who you are. Based on your shoes and time on your watch, I reckon you came from India. In fact, it is North India, looking at your attire. And, as I could see a lot of people waiting for your autographs outside, you must be a popular figure in India. Oh yes, you are in politics! Politics and Popular… You must be none other than Nitish Kumar! Welcome Mr Kumar, How can I help you?

Finding out the Modi Wave

Modi: Grrrrrr!! (angrily)

Watson: Sherlock, It’s not Nitish, This is Mr Modi.

SH: Oh.. yes of course! Welcome Mr Modi. Let me guess why you are here. It is Cricket, isn’t it? You were involved in some cricket related scam, fighting with the BCCI, and some controversy related to a foreign travel too?

Watson: Sherlock.. No!! You got it wrong again. This is Narendra Modi, not Lalit Modi. He is India’s Prime Minister.

SH: Oh..yes of course. Welcome Mr Modi!

SH (murmuring in Watson’s ear): How did you know this (about Modi’s identity) Watson??

Watson (murmuring back): From Newspaper, besides, he has our appointment.

SH: Okay, Mr Modi, How can I help you?

Modi: Hmm.. I came here to report a lost property and I need your help in finding it.

SH: Oh, can you please explain in detail?

Modi: okay.. Mitron.. I used to have a property called ‘Modi Wave’ with me. I loved it. It gave me many benefits. But, I don’t know how, I lost it one day.

SH: ‘Modi Wave’.. Hmm interesting. Let me guess what this is. This must be the new unbearable disgusting ultrasonic sound wave on which Stephen Hawking is working on recently?

Modi: No! It is named after me. It is my charm.. my luck… my wave in elections. It is the reason why BJP got more than 280 seats in Indian General elections in 2014. I lost it recently.

SH: BJP, let me guess. This is a political party in India?

Watson: Ah.. finally, you got it right this time..

SH: And BJP is an acronym for? let me guess.. Bhakt Jan Parivaar?

Modi: Oh God! The articles in UK papers are showing the effect. You are a detective, don’t believe the media! BJP is ‘Bhakt Janata Party’.. oops.. sorry.. I mean it is ‘Bharatiya Janata Party’.

SH: Okay.. Mr Modi. May I know on what day you have exactly lost your ‘Modi wave’?

Modi: I don’t know. It was somewhere before Delhi elections..

SH: Do you have any suspects?

Modi: Yes, Kejriwal. it must be him!

SH: Hmm.. Kejriwal. I know this guy, we have received few other complaints as well. let me guess how this happened…

Watson: Sherlock, Please!!! Stop guessing, you are not doing it right anyway today. Please ask Mr Modi to continue.

SH: Okay Watson.. Mr Modi.. Please continue.. Why do you think. it is Kejriwal?

Modi: I used to have ‘Modi Wave’ in my pocket, till Varanasi election campaign during General Elections. Kejriwal was with me in that campaign fighting against me. I am sure he might have taken my wave and hiding under his muffler. He tweeted against BJP during Bihar elections too.

SH: Hmm.. That’s enough Mr Modi. We will start investigating what is under Kejriwal’s muffler and will get you back the ‘Modi wave’.

Watson: And the title of my new blog post is ‘The case of missing Modi wave’.

LK Advani (suddenly appearing out of nowhere): I too have written a blog post. Will you guys read it?

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-spending-dussehra-deepavali-vacations-at-home-pm-modi-resumes-his-routine-work-by-travelling-abroad-8565,"New Delhi. After an extended Dussehra and Deepavali vacation, PM Modi will resume his foreign visits this week starting with UK, followed by Turkey, Malaysia and Singapore all in this November. Before the year comes to end, an important trip to Russia is planned before Christmas vacation starts.

As per our sources in PMO, due to shortage of time, China and Pakistan visits have been postponed to next year. One of the senior bureaucrat working in PMO spoke to us on the condition of anonymity. According to the official, “It was a pretty long break for PM because of Bihar election. Please remember PM had come back to India on October 1st from US and you can see more than 40 days gap between US and UK visit.”

Narendra Modi resuming his regular work

“Nothing much we could have done. PM wanted to campaign in Bihar and help his party to come to power. On other side he was equally upset that his routine work which he usually does by travelling abroad came to a halt. He directed us to push all the October visits to November. It is tough for anyone to manage four high profile visits within 15 days. He has assured us, he can manage. We wanted to push couple of visits towards end of December to give proper gap between visits, but foreign offices of these countries rejected our proposal saying their heads will not be available during Christmas and New Year vacation time,” the official added.

The official further said, “We feel for our PM. Last year during Navratri fasting he was in US, luckily this year Navratri came after his US trip, but no rest. He had to campaign for Bihar 1st phase election during his fasting. We feel he needs to delegate some of his foreign trips to others like Dhoni did by handing over test captaincy to Kohli. My suggestion would be, he should focus on big ones like US, UK, Australia, France, Germany kind of countries, say all G-8 countries. Outside of G-8 countries visit, he should nominate his ministers looking at their performance. It would be kind of performance incentive bonus for these ministers.”

When we pointed out most of PM’s visits happen between June to December, to give him some respite, trips can be arranged between Jan and May. The official was quick to rebuke and said, “Please note this is the case for only 2015. Modiji came to power to in May 2014 and we immediately arranged his foreign trips starting from June. Last year he had so many trips abroad between June and December, we thought of giving him a break. He is not super human, he also deserves break. We also need to make arrangement such a way that he gets chance to spend some quality time at home in India.”

“In hindsight we feel, we did a mistake. We will not repeat the same next year. China and Pakistan visits, we are trying to arrange as early as possible in 2016. I can’t disclose now, we are discussing with many countries to give us go ahead for arranging trips in early part of 2016. By the way Jan to April is a lean period for travel both for foreign as well as domestic. Even our own IRCTC works fine during this period without crashing. We would be able to save some money as the travel cost will be lower for the PMO during this period,” Official concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/modi-foreign-trip-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-spending-dussehra-deepavali-vacations-at-home-pm-modi-resumes-his-routine-work-by-travelling-abroad-8565,"After spending Dussehra & Deepavali vacations at home, PM Modi resumes his routine work by travelling abroad",,1447317879.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dogs-protest-against-bjp-leaders-for-dragging-them-into-dog-fights-8562,"New Delhi: The dogged way in which BJP leaders are attacking their own party men after the results of Bihar elections has caused a lot of heartburn to the dog community.

Dogs concerned with their names being dragged into political fights

From Modi’s puppy remark during 2014 elections to the recent exchange of words between Shatrughan Sinha and Vijayvargiya, dogs have been hogging headlines for the wrong reasons.

“Initially they used to call Digvijay Singh as Dogvijay Singh which was humiliating in itself but now they are going a step further and dragging us unnecessarily in their verbal duels,” said a golden retriever who didn’t wish to be named.

Around 500 dogs from the national capital are planning a silent protest march and if sources are to be believed a hunger strike is also on cards, if the government doesn’t reign in those who defame dogs.

Meanwhile, a section of dogs have approached Don, Somnath Bharti’s dog who is also the president of dog wing of Aam Janvar Party. “Dog’s are not happy at being singled out and I can empathize with them. A section of dogs have filed a petition asking for a ban on politicians from dragging dogs into political fights,” he said.

“It’s not easy for dogs these days, the other day I was watching TV and this singer called Abhijeet was saying something about footpaths and dogs. Itne bure din aa gaye hai hamare,” he added.

The rising intolerance against dogs has also prompted President Obama to issue a statement asking PM Modi to make the environment in India conducive for dogs.

Meanwhile a primetime debate which sought the address the issue of growing intolerance against dogs saw the anchor barking away all most of the politicians on the panel.

“Every dog has his day but it turns out that every day is a ‘dog day’ for these leaders. There are so many other animals. Why only dogs and why not cats. I hold bollywood partly responsible for starting this trend. Why don’t they have billi mai tera khoon pi jaaonga?” questioned the fiery news anchor.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dogs.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dogs-protest-against-bjp-leaders-for-dragging-them-into-dog-fights-8562,Dogs protest against BJP leaders for dragging them into dog fights,,1447151420.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/crackers-burst-outside-congress-party-hq-on-sunday-cured-my-breathing-problem-environment-activist-8560,"New Delhi: An Environmental activist who was campaigning for Cracker-less Diwali for twenty years, has suddenly revealed that ‘her breathing problem was cured by crackers burst outside Congress party Headquarters’. Incidentally, she was on the road outside Congress party Headquarters here, when this miraculous cure happened.

Even the Delhi air felt cleaner on that day. But it will be polluted again on Diwali and I may get back my breathing illness,” said Sheila with a sad face.

Sheila Butt, aged 38, the environmental activist who claimed about this cure, spoke to us, “Before talking about this miracle, I have to say how I started this noble campaign against Crackers. I was born in a Hindu family and my father along with my brothers used to burst a lot of crackers during Diwali. Because of the harmful smoke and the dangerous decibels that emanated from the crackers burst during Diwali, I got this breathing problem at the age of 17. Even after running from small clinics to respiratory specialists for a year, my breathing problem never got cured. So, at the age of 18, when I was in my first year of college, I started a rally a week before the Diwali, requesting people around my college to avoid crackers on Diwali.”

Suppressing her wide smile, she continued, “There was no turning back then. I did not get any job, so I became an activist. Because of my effective campaigning for the past twenty years, many families gave up crackers and instead either hugged each other or played NaragasurMom-NaragasurChild during Diwali. But my health did not improve. Whenever there is cracker smoke around, I end up having fits of cough. So, I never venture out in Diwali week. I had suffered a lot in the past twenty years, till 8th November 2015.”

“I was walking on the Akbar Road, last Sunday, when we heard that Laluji is winning the Bihar elections. Being an ardent Congress voter all my life, I am happy this time that the party which was supported by Congress won it. This was a slap on the face of anti-Environment Hindutva parties. With all these happiness, I forgot that I did not cough even after crackers were bursting all around me in the road and I was enveloped by cracker smoke. For the first time in my life, my illness related to cracker smoke has stopped. This Bihar election is indeed a vote against my breathing intolerance,” beamed Sheila.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/congress-celebrations-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/crackers-burst-outside-congress-party-hq-on-sunday-cured-my-breathing-problem-environment-activist-8560,Crackers burst outside Congress party HQ on Sunday cured my breathing problem- Environment Activist,,1447139600.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-deeply-introspect-on-its-unexpected-performance-in-bihar-election-high-command-calls-for-an-emergency-meeting-8556,"New Delhi: Top leadership of the Congress party is in utter disbelief and shock after reviewing party’s performance in Bihar assembly election. Party high command is worried how the public and political analysts will look at Congress performance because for years they have been the only consistent party which believed in losing election after election.

Sonia and Rahul in an emergency meet

When we contacted party’s long standing spokesperson Mr. Manish Tiwari, he was upset with party’s performance and also for not getting hint from the party leadership that they will win so many seats. Mr. Tiwari said, “I am not prepared to speak on a performance like this. 27 seats we have won out of 41 seats we contested which is like winning percentage of 65%. This is something I have not seen from my party from the time I am with Congress.”

“My preparation for last few weeks has been on the ground that we will win zero seats if we are at our best or with slightly worst performance we might win up to 5 seats. This is something I was repeatedly reminding my party leadership and was telling them if you see Congress will fall below it’s current form, please let me know advance. It is not easy to face the panel on live TV debates especially the ones hosted by Arnab without doing proper ground work.”

Mr. Tiwari added, “That’s reason I did not participate in any of the live TV debates. By evening I got a chance to speak to Mr. Rahul Gandhi who was equally upset that his track record of lower output with every election has come to an end.”

Mr. Gandhi told me, “I cancelled my foreign trips and come back to India so that I can campaign extensively. I did not want others in my party to get a chance to campaign. This is to ensure we are on our path of reaching zero seats everywhere by 2019. Whatever you do, there are others who want to do one better. Now looks like BJP under Modiji is also trying to copy my formula.”

Manish said, “As Rahulji has apologized to me personally, I consider this as end. He has also told me to prepare extensively so that we can master the art of defending zero seats in future. He has assured me that he will work much more and do whatever is needed to achieve his dream.”

“Rahulji told me, he has called for an emergency meeting of the party core group and he has invited all the new 27 MLAs to join that meeting. We have few tough questions for them. They need to explain what all they have promised to voters so that they have voted for them. Last we expect our party to be called a feku party who only speak and do not deliver,” Manish said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sonia-rahul.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-deeply-introspect-on-its-unexpected-performance-in-bihar-election-high-command-calls-for-an-emergency-meeting-8556,"Congress to deeply introspect on its unexpected performance in Bihar election, high command calls for an emergency meeting",,1447049352.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/who-declares-modi-intolerance-a-new-epidemic-in-india-with-number-of-cases-surpassing-lactose-intolerance-8552,"In a recent study, the World Health Organization has found an alarming number of cases of a new condition, which is now termed as ‘Modi Intolerance’, named so due to a certain set of typical symptoms shown by the victims.

WHO declares intolerance as epidemic

Following is an excerpt from the WHO report :

“Indian population is known to be affected by medical conditions like lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance and intolerance to certain other food substances. While lactose intolerance is widespread, though unnoticed, gluten intolerance too is found in significant numbers. However, a large section of the Indian population is now found to have been suffering from a new such condition and it has assumed epidemic proportions. Since a typical symptom exhibited by all victims, though not expressed explicitly, is the varying degrees of dislike for the country’s Prime Minister Modi and his party, with or without reason, the condition has been named Modi Intolerance. The extent of dislike varies from plain dislike to angst to disgust to pure and utter hatred, and the situation is likely to negatively affect the health, if not of the carrier of the disease, certainly of the nation.”

In a press conference subsequent to release of the above report, an official from the WHO India office briefed reporters.

Reporter: Is this condition found only in India?

WHO: Yes, this is found predominantly only in India. There are a few cases reported from other countries, but it is restricted to people of Indian origin only. A variant of this is found in countries neighboring India, which are belligerent towards India. I don’t want to name them, but this condition may have spread from one those countries which are also known to send other entities across the border. It affects the political class and the military there.

Reporter: Since when has this disease affected Indians?

WHO: It was found in small numbers for several years now, restricted to areas around Gujarat. But it seems to have started increasing around the end of 2013, beginning of 2014 and spreading to other regions as well. There was huge jump in the numbers during May 2014 and has now proliferated throughout the country and assumed epidemic proportions.

Reporter: Who among Indians are affected most? Is there a pattern?

WHO: The pattern is getting discovered. Many, many people have mild signs of the disease. But strangely, severe cases seem to be confined to people of certain professions or industries. Like politicians, media, intelligentsia, academia, literati and such.

Reporter: What are the typical symptoms?

WHO: Just like in case of lactose intolerance where the victim cannot digest milk and milk products, here the victim cannot digest anything that Modi and his party say or do. They consider anything related to Modi and his party as bad. They attribute anything that goes wrong in the country to Modi. They try to find negatives even in positive developments. The condition worsens when Modi does not say anything in response to the victim’s behavior and utterances.

Reporter: How does the disease manifest itself?

WHO: It varies, but there is a pattern overall. It shows up at two levels. At the physical level, it starts as anger, blabbering, shouting, making absurd statements and then staging dharnas, carrying out marches, etc. At what can be called as abstract or philosophical level, some people give up their possessions, like awards and recognitions, which they got deservedly or otherwise. Some have even returned library books borrowed years ago that they had never intended returning. Others give up their coveted positions in bodies, committees. In fact, a good number of you from the media are said to be seriously suffering from this condition. In a few cases, the victims display phobia of saffron colour. Distortion of facts and exaggeration are pretty much common to all the people. Forcing others to behave similarly is another common sign.

Reporter: How does it spread?

WHO: Mainly word of mouth. One person blabbers and the next one catches it and blabbers too. Another reason for spreading is peer pressure. Again, you people from the media are identified as the carriers of the disease. You help spread the disease fast.

Reporter: What is the remedy?

Self help. One has to cure himself or herself of it. For now there is no medicine. And the carriers like you should behave responsibly and contain the disease rather than spreading it. The number of cases surpasses that of lactose intolerance and other food related intolerances.

WHO, in its statement, has hoped that India and its people will soon find a cure to it as the cure is really in their own hands.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/who.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/who-declares-modi-intolerance-a-new-epidemic-in-india-with-number-of-cases-surpassing-lactose-intolerance-8552,"WHO declares ‘Modi Intolerance’ a new epidemic in India, with number of cases surpassing lactose intolerance",,1446875796.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-manufacture-assembled-awards-so-that-returnee-can-return-his-part-of-the-award-without-hurting-teams-sentiments-8553,"New Delhi: Gone are the days when only one indivisible award was given to the entire team, paying no heed to the sentiments of the whole team and their desire to own the precious cup or trophy, while only the most dominating person of the winning team would get to keep it.

Prototype of an assembled award

Yes, we are talking about the government’s new scheme “Samvet Puraskar Yojana” that promises comforting convenience to the award winning personalities. Today, high profile national awards given by the government come as single unit irrespective of the fact whether it is conferred upon an individual or the whole team. Usually, the trophy goes to the most commanding personality rather than the most demanding.

With the new scheme, an award will appear to be a single unit but in fact, it will be an assembly of multiple parts. Judges will be entitled to map a part each to every team member of the winning team. For example, base of the award can be owned by choreographer while the jewel on its hilt could go to lead female in the team. This way every one gets to keep their part depending on how big a part they played in having the team win the award.

As this is pre-designated by the judges, there will be no chance of grudges among team members. Also, whenever there are signs of slightest intolerance in the country, a prospect returnee from the team can return his part!

Intellectuals from various fields seemed quite happy with Samvet Puraskar Yojana’s announcement; something that happened for the first time in last 1 to 2 years.

Dibakar Banerjee, who had returned the team award without taking consent from anyone from the team said, “If this Yojana was announced a little earlier, I wouldn’t have had to face intolerance arising from my intolerance towards climate of country’s intolerance.”

Sources say, government has taken a very good step by separating the concerns by simply separating the parts of award. This could well end up being a master stroke given its potential to bring out the genuine percentage of intolerance in the country.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gold-trophy-300x199.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-manufacture-assembled-awards-so-that-returnee-can-return-his-part-of-the-award-without-hurting-teams-sentiments-8553,Govt. to manufacture 'assembled' awards so that returnee can return his part of the award without hurting team's sentiments,,1446873022.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An adamant Lalu Yadav speaking to the media and putting forth his demand for money

Not to be left behind, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has claimed his rightful Rs 4 lakh. Speaking to Faking News he said, “Nine children ka father hai hum, batao kitna paisa banta hai hamara. Dus lakh banta hai na. Hum Uddhav Thackeray sahab se request karta hu ki woh humko hamara paisa de.“

But Shiv Sena spokesperson has flatly refuted Lalu Yadav’s claim saying, “Our scheme is only valid for a family that has five kids, which are born between 2010 to 2015. Lalu Yadav doesn’t fit that criterion.”

BJP parliamentarian Sakshi Maharaj has welcomed this move of Shiv Sena and said, “I am very glad that Shiv Sena has set the threshold to 5 children. It is one more than the minimum-children (four) that a Hindu woman should have to protect Hinduism and Sanatan Dharma.”

Meanwhile, Mulayam Singh Yadav has raised doubts over this scheme and said it defies his logic. Speaking to party workers he said, “A man can never have four children from a single woman. It is not practical. This scheme is vague and purposeless. Since no one can ever have five children from a single wife, everybody will violate preconditions of this scheme.”

Experts are of the opinion that it is a politically motivated move by Shiv Sena and likely to cause polarization in Bihar before the assembly election. Sonia Gandhi has alleged and said, “Polarization is BJP’s masterstroke to win elections.”

She further added, “A Yale study confirms that my allegations are genuine.”

Lalu Prasad, however was adamant and said, “Either give me Rs 4 lakh or abort this scheme.”

VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi too had a few words to say. While supporting this scheme she said, “People who are opposing this scheme should go to Pakistan.”

Lalu’s demand on this issue has given birth to another protest. Parents who have only four children born between 2010 to 2015, are now demanding that the applicability period of this scheme be extended by 9 months.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lalu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lalu-claims-rs-4-lakh-following-shiv-senas-announcement-of-rs-2-lakh-reward-for-every-hindu-family-which-has-five-children-8341,"Lalu claims Rs 4 Lakh following Shiv Sena's announcement of Rs 2 Lakh reward for every Hindu family, which has five children",,1441178495.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/hardik-patel-fails-to-get-reservation-on-irctc-followers-burn-laptops-chew-lan-cables-8328,"Ahmedabad: Leader and visionary of reservation-loving youth Hardik Patel in a press conference has lashed out at Indian Railways for not letting him get a reservation through IRCTC website.

Hardik Patel gives 1 day ultimatum to IRCTC for his ticket reservation.

“Even after trying for 3 hours at a stretch I was not able to book 3 berths in 3rd AC. I was so fedup that I threw the laptop in the flames of the bus which our brothers had just burnt,” Hardik fumed in anger and told reporters. He further told reporters that he had to then book 3 business class airline tickets using his iPhone 6 using his platinum credit card.

After sipping his Diet-Pepsi he further threatened, “If IRCTC does not let me book tickets, I will ask my millionaire NRI Patel brothers to not invest in coal mines in India anymore. No investment, no workers, no coal, no rails. Further we will not even supply a single drop of milk to railways. Good luck to railway passengers with no cups of semi-cold tea-coffee during those long rail journeys.”

Hardik’s followers were apparently so outraged at his not getting a reservation at IRCTC website that they took out their anger on anything remotely related to websites and internet. They ended up ravaging 2 cyber-cafes, 3 laptop showrooms and 5 computer accessories shops where they burned numerous laptops, crushed hard-disks and even chewed LAN cables. No arrests however have been made in this case as yet.

However the repercussions of this incident were felt throughout the country. A lot of secular liberal political leaders have come in Hardik’s support after this incident. They have condemned IRCTC for depriving a poor minority of his rights to commute at reasonable prices and forcing him to travel business class.

Meanwhile, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal has sent his party worker to Gujarat to have talks with Hardik Patel and check if providing WiFi to Gujarat will solve the problem.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hp3.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/hardik-patel-fails-to-get-reservation-on-irctc-followers-burn-laptops-chew-lan-cables-8328,"Hardik Patel fails to get reservation on IRCTC, followers burn laptops, chew LAN cables",,1440741987.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While this is seen as a move to defeat BJP in Bihar, many anti-corruption crusaders who supported Kejriwal were disappointed by his move.

Kejriwal to Nitish, “You take this chair now, I will take your chair later.”

Our Investigation team seeks to expose the covert operation of Arvind Kejriwal in nabbing the famous corrupt Lalu and his new dost Nitish Kumar.

First, our investigation team tried to contact several important heads in AAP to find out the reason behind Kejriwal’s sudden friendship with Nitish-Lalu.

“Initially, I could not believe that our Kejriwalji was going to team up with Nitish-Lalu. We were anxious over how to take forward our anti-corruption movement. But, one of our members from the top brass who is in direct touch with Kejriwal cleared all our doubts. Kejriwal is on a secret operation to nab the duo. He will try and move closer to them and will win their confidence. And finally, he will go to the depth of the corruption and bring out the corrupt. Our Kejriwalji is more like Radhe of Wanted. He acted like a ruffian to bring the evil ruffians to jail, our leader will act as an ally of corrupt to send the corrupt behind bars,” said one leader from Delhi unit, on conditions of anonymity.

After gathering this explosive info, we then confirmed this with several other state unit leaders of AAP. Bihar unit leaders also sounded affirmative on this info.

One top leader of Bihar unit said, “This is a covert operation. I hope that you don’t publish this. First, Arvind will try to find out important contacts in the Nitish-Lalu duo’s camp. Then, he will track down the list of politicians and their benamis. Finally, all the routes of corrupt money will be traced and a big dossier will be prepared.”

“But we have planned to stay mum on the whole covert ops till the announcement of Bihar election results. By then, Kejriwalji would have defeated BJP in the elections. After the win, Kejriwal will expose the corruption history of Nitish and Lalu. Then, they will be sent to jail and Kejriwal will be coronated as CM of Bihar. He will be functioning as CM of both Bihar and Delhi. If Bihar governor tries to intervene Kejriwal, then he must be mostly a Modi agent, like LG Najeeb,” concluded the Bihar AAP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/arvind-kejariwal-nitish-kumar-300x207.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwals-covert-operation-to-unearth-corruption-of-lalu-and-nitish-by-appearing-to-be-their-ally-8323,"Arvind Kejriwal's covert operation to unearth corruption of Lalu and Nitish, by appearing to be their ally",,1440657726.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/we-cancelled-talks-with-india-as-kashmiri-pulao-was-not-on-lunch-menu-nawaz-sharif-8311,"Rawalpindi: In another bizarre explanation that has shocked the world, Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has reportedly blamed the lunch menu on NSA meeting for cancellation of talks with India. This out-of-the-box blame follows after his weird explanation on their rejection of Indian sweets offered by BSF.

Nawaz disappointed with NSA lunch menu

The menu was made public by the government as soon as the talks were cancelled. To provide more information, it was a typical lunch menu with Cucumber-Onion Salad, choice of Roti/Naan, Dal Makhni, Mutter Paneer, Malai Kofta, Aloo-Dum Biryani, Chicken Biryani and Murg Musalam.

The famous dish often seen during Indo-Pak meetings: Kashmiri Pulao, was clearly missing this time.

Speculations are that India wants Pakistan to forget about Kashmir and doesn’t want to compromise on this at any cost.

Speaking to Faking News reporter, a security official said, “There was an exclusive, pre-defined agenda set for these talks and we wanted to do our best not to shift focus towards otherwise common diversions like Bollywood, cultural exchange, chaman ki aasha and so on.

Moreover, Sharif himself had revealed the secret of their diabetic condition recently. So, you tell me, what purpose would a sweet pulao offered to diabetic people serve?”

Reactions poured in from the Sharif camp as well. One of their officials said, “Deliberate omission of Kashmiri Pulao and at the same time, including Balochi Fried Rice is clearly a conspiracy to avoid the issue spanning over decades. Like we said earlier, we are doing our best in tackling terrorism. If you’re looking for proof, please check with the survey agency that has recently included Pakistan in world’s 100 safest places to stay.”

It is being believed that separatists were sent parcels of Biryani made in Hyderabad’s Paradise Hotel. This was to ensure they had delicious lunch at their respective homes in the guise of house arrest.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nawaz-sharif-pensive-183250-184501-186989-640x480-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/we-cancelled-talks-with-india-as-kashmiri-pulao-was-not-on-lunch-menu-nawaz-sharif-8311,We cancelled talks with India as Kashmiri Pulao was not on lunch menu: Nawaz Sharif,,1440400241.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,"New Delhi: The Indian Government’s enthusiasm in its foreign policy has prompted many developments. The most recent is a joint working group setup to do a feasibility study for a possible India-Pakistan Free Terrorist Agreement (FTA). Terrorism is becoming a global industry, and hence, the increasing world consensus is towards enabling free competition of terrorist organizations, without interference from governments. A slew of allegations from both sides on anti-competitive terrorist practices is believed to be the main reason behind this development. An FTA with Pakistan would mean that terrorism will have open borders. The Indian side is represented by the Indian Insecure Mujahidin (IIM), while Taliban-ka-Baap (TKB) is the chief negotiator from Pakistan’s side.

India’s concerns

As per “terror-leaks”, certain confidential documents highlight concerns raised by India’s chief negotiator on good and bad terrorism. India is particularly concerned about the recent quality of terrorism exported from Pakistan into India. On the issue of Naved, who was recently caught by India in Udhampur, India’s chief negotiator lamented, “We are really concerned about the quality of terrorists imported from Pakistan. They are turning out to be plain duds, and spoil the image of all of us. They take all the limelight and credit too. The Indian terrorist ecosystem has just begun to evolve, and the domestic terrorist industry must be protected. We find it hard to compete with the buffoonery of Pakistani terrorists. Too much unnecessary heropanti. ”

The Indian side has hinted that they will undertake activities to sabotage Pakistani terror’s India expansion plans. Sources have revealed that the major method of doing so would be by secretly infiltrating the Pakistani terrorist supply chain. Once done, Pakistani terrorists will be unknowingly supplied fake grenades, AK-47 pichkaris, maps with Afghanistan labelled as India, and exploding walkie-talkies. The IIM representative feels that though this is an unfair move, it is an opportunity for IIM terrorists to become martyrs (they will die laughing).

Pakistan’s concerns

The Pakistani side, on the other hand, raised the issue of domestic market saturation. Too many terrorists and too many terrorist activities are forcing the terrorism behemoth to focus on export-led growth. They also feel that saffron groups & Maoists are increasingly taking centre stage in the media.

“We know that we are the best. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Just look at what e-Commerce is doing to the retail industry. We are slowly becoming a commodity. We want to constantly innovate to maintain our leadership – both in the media, and on the stupidity scale,” reasoned the TKB representative.

Global terrorist agreements

Amidst the ongoing negotiation is the threat of a mega free terrorist pact that ISIS is negotiating with various other countries like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. IIM claims that infrastructure bottlenecks and old video technology has rendered them uncompetitive compared to ISIS and the government should provide some domestic support (read subsidies) to the domestic industry. This is expected in the form of HD cameras, as well as English classes. The All India Terrorist Association (AITA) in a representation to the GOI has expressed its concern over the “huge capacity overhang” in ISIS which could “kill” Indian industry.

They have also highlighted that apart from ISIS, India also faces stiff competition from Pakistan and should get a level playing field in order for them to compete with Pakistan as they receive around 30% of their GDP as subsidies from the Pakistani government while in India this number is 0.

The Indian government has said that they are “sympathetic” towards the concerns of the industry but now the Indian domestic industry should get ready for reduced tariff lines and high quality imports of “good terrorist” into India as the free terrorists pacts are a reality. The protectionist policy of the previous government will not be tolerated by the new government.

A new era of competitive terrorism

We hope that unlike Free Trade pacts, India does not lose out in terms of negotiations of Free Terrorist Agreement. Many experts have highlighted the India’s “terrorist” deficit has increased fourfold in the past decade and Indian domestic industry has suffered on this count. So the endeavour should be to “Make in India” rather import into India.

AITA, has also said that it will also align itself to the “Skilling India” campaign so as to promote domestic skill development and ensure employability of fresh terrorists. A phased introduction of the FTA would ensure that the domestic industry has a chance to develop itself, and not to always be a cry-baby.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sartaz_aziz-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,Talks begin on the India-Pakistan FTA (Free Terrorist Agreement),,1440305755.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taking-support-from-aap-is-against-our-political-dna-senior-rjd-leaders-warn-lalu-8306,"Patna: In the quest to stay relevant in Bihar politics, Lalu Prasad Yadav faces the dilemma of his life. On one hand are the people who devotedly supported his every act of crime and corruption even when courts convicted him. On the other hand he has self-styled anti-corruption flagbearer Arvind Kejriwal, who according to media reports is ready to take the anti-corruption movement in Bihar by campaigning for RJD.

Both began as anti-corruption crusaders and then…

This news has put the second layer of RJD leaders in spot. They are at loss of words to explain the core voters whether the party stands for corruption or against it. With the leadership getting confused and core voters getting disillusioned there is a growing fear of revolt in the ranks sooner or later.

Pappu Yadav, an RJD leader who is accused in multiple scams and murders openly questioned Lalu, “Joining hands with Nitish Kumar, who beat us black and blue in last state election, may still not hurt RJD’s political DNA. But how do we explain our voters about getting support from AAP? AAP takes pride in being against corruption and we do exact opposite. We all have seen the big banners in Delhi that say Kejriwal has reduced corruption in Delhi. If he does the same here, what will our kids eat? Lauki?”

Sensing the growing discomfort in party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav called on Nitish Kumar to ensure that AAP is kept away from campaigning in 100 seats that RJD’s is fighting.

Meanwhile AAP supporters are not much bothered about Kejriwal’s decision to support an alliance comprising of RJD and Congress, two parties which were considered full of corrupt and criminals respectively.

“At least he is doing something. What is Modi doing except travelling abroad and taking selfies? Since Kejriwal has not kept any portfolio with him and Modi is not letting him do any other work, he is reviewing movies to kill time. So even if he goes to Bihar, no work will get stuck in Delhi,” remarked an ardent AAP supporter from Lajpat Nagar.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CM4EPtAUYAEdvrY-300x153.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taking-support-from-aap-is-against-our-political-dna-senior-rjd-leaders-warn-lalu-8306,"Taking support from AAP is against our political DNA, senior RJD leaders warn Lalu",,1440227866.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,"Mumbai: A day after Mulayam Singh said that it was ‘practically not possible for four men to rape a woman’, Valmiki Gopal, also known as ‘The Mumbai Masturbator’ has sought a certificate of innocence from Mulayam Singh.

Certificate of Innocence

Speaking to Faking News from Mumbai he said, “All I did was masturbate and we all do that, albeit discreetly. But look how the media is painting me as a villain. I can’t believe I am living in the same country, where in one state the authorities are defending the rapists while in another the CM is swiftly taking action against me for masturbating in broad daylight.”

“I was humiliated on social media with my pic going viral. I was not given a chance to explain my position. No one calls me by my real name now. They all call me ‘mumbai masturbator’. My reputation is tarnished, so I seek an ‘innocence certificate’ from Mulayam Singh,” he said.

Valmiki was also dejected with the attitude of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis for initiating swift police action.

“I just took a ‘hard stand’ against the porn ban and decided to protest in my way. This government is not allowing peaceful protests now. I think emergency days are back,” he added.

Apparently, Valmiki is planning to leave Mumbai for good and relocate to Uttar Pradesh. “No point staying here anymore. At least I can live with some respect and dignity in Uttar Pradesh. I am pretty sure Mulayam Singh won’t treat me like this if I feel like masturbating there. I have spoken to few people from UP who were accused of rape and they said, ‘koi tension wali baat nahi bhaiyyaji naam se hi nahi kaam se bhi mulayam hai’.”

When FN tried to contact Samajwadi Party spokesperson for their response on Valmiki Gopal’s request, the spokesperson acknowledged that they had indeed received a request from the aforementioned person.

“We are looking into the matter. Mulayamji has to look into the practicalities of the situation before taking any decision. Next week he will be handing out innocence certificates to rape convicts, probably he will give an official statement then,” said the spokesperson.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ceritficate-of-innocence.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,Mumbai masturbator seeks 'Innocence Certificate' from Mulayam Singh,,1440058980.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The stalemate between the Govt and students at FTTI prompted Arvind Kejriwal to use this opportunity to teach the students intricacies of film making.

Speaking to Faking News from New Delhi, the AAP chief said, “It’s not a case of political opportunism, I am deeply concerned about the future of the students at FTII. If these students don’t get the right environment to study, we’ll have mindless movies flooding the market. AAP has all the resources to start a Film Insititute here in Delhi. Our own party workers have hands on experience in drama and will form the core faculty.”

When questioned about the name of the institute he replied, “We are planning to name the institute as AAP Institute of Drama Study (AIDS). Our first institute will be located in Delhi and later we intend to spread AIDS across the country.”

Our sources within the party tell us that AAP leader Ashutosh with take up session on drama and the teach students how to emote in front of the camera while Kumar Vishwas will take session on make-up and beauty.

Students will also be shown audio-visuals of Parliament sessions to help them understand the nuances of drama.

As part of their summer projects, the students will be creating ads for the party and the best ad will get a chance to be featured on TV channels. Arvind Kejriwal will himself review all summer projects, like he has done with the release of Bollywood movies on Friday.

Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami has also been roped in as guest faculty.

FTII students too are happy. Rakesh Kumar, who joined FTII in 1992 said, “I my 23 years as a student at FTII, I have never witnessed something like this before, referring to the FTII deadlock.

PM Modi pointing towards a location on the map, giving an indication about his next trip.

According to Mr. Patra, “When Amazon or Flipkart advertise for a mega sale, people rush to buy as if there is no tomorrow. They never give a thought whether the product they are buying will be of any use or not. The other day one of my esteemed colleague working in a startup bought 4 pairs of black leather shoes and 6 pairs of Peter England shirts and formal trousers.”

While explaining frequent overseas visits by the PM, he said, “Modiji has travelled across whole world to bring laurels for the country. Because of these trips it’s natural, you will get good amount of frequent flyer air miles. May be many are not aware of this, these air miles will expire by end of this month as festival season is starting from next month and airlines expect occupancy rate to go up and they do not have to give too many freebies.”

Mr. Patra added, “I am confused, what is the problem if someone is redeeming those miles to make short trips like UAE one which our PM did recently. Though he did not speak, he was present in India when parliament session was going on. He conserved his energy to give us a speech to remember from Red Fort on Independence Day. After that went abroad only for 2 days and immediately back to his business. I find it strange, instead of appreciating this, some are criticizing.”

Mr. Patra told our reporter, “Most of us know this, and still let me clarify once more. Frequent flyer air miles can be used to access the airport lounge, upgrade the travel class and so on. These things are anyway available free for PM of any country. The major cost is the ticket cost for which some of the tax payers are complaining. For UAE trip the full ticket cost we saved by redeeming the miles. Still we have enough miles to arrange one free trip to Bhutan.”

When we asked Mr. Patra about the complaints by opposition he said, “They should be the last people to complain about our tax payer’s money. Because of them complete monsoon session was a wash out. They have no Idea, UN has made our PM as the ambassador for their new tourism initiative called Incredible World.”

Mr. Dhananjay Jha of Congress has criticized BJP spokesperson’s statement that they have no Idea. Mr. Jha told us, “As usual BJP is once again wrong with the facts. I have three connections of Idea, so many from my party use Idea phone, even Rahulji is using Idea phone for accessing IIN service. I would urge my close friend Mr. Patra for whom I have highest regard to do his homework properly before commenting on Congress party.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/modi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/do-not-complain-if-you-have-no-idea-modi-is-doing-short-trips-like-uae-one-to-redeem-the-air-miles-before-they-expire-bjp-spokesperson-8296,"Do not complain if you have no Idea, Modi is doing short trips like UAE one to redeem the air miles before they expire: BJP spokesperson",,1439968657.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mayawati: She intends to meet all statues in UAE to understand their problems and appeal to UAE govt to allot some land in the country where her tallest statue can be built.

Mulayam Singh Yadav: He would hold meeting with opposition parties in UAE for a possible third front alliance in India to stop communal forces from winning more elections. It will be called ‘Great Grand Alliance’ or ‘Ultra Janta Parivaar’.

Sharad Pawar: He will further strengthen his secular credentials by meeting Sheikhs and learning about their lifestyle, bank accounts and way they control natural resources.

Arvind Kejriwal: After waiving electricity bills for defaulters in Delhi, Kejriwal with an eye on 2019 Lok Sabha elections now intends to win over hearts of NRIs in UAE and will therefore demand waiver of their electricity and water bills from UAE govt.

Vasundhra Raje: With Rajasthan Cricket Association suspended by BCCI to host any IPL matches, Raje would ask UAE govt to let Rajasthan Royals hosts matches there. She will however deny that this demand has got anything to do with Lalit Modi.

Rahul Gandhi: He intends to go there and gatecrash random Indian households to have dinner with them. He will further even ask for more salaries to be given to NRIs working under Adani. However for the sake of Muslim vote bank in India, he will refrain from doing women empowerment there.

Jayalalitha: She will go on a study tour the jails of UAE and would implement the same facilities back in jails of Tamil Nadu, since she is quite a regular visitor there.

Nitish Kumar: The CM of Bihar not satisfied with just 50 lakh samples collected from Bihar, will go to UAE and cut nails and hair of NRI biharis and Biahri laborers to send them for a DNA test.

He has clarified during multiple press conferences that he is the only one who should be provided sole rights of interfering in education of the masses.

Kartavya Sengupta explains why only he should be allowed to interfere in academics (Resemblance to Amartya Sen is purely coincidental)

Faking News Reporter: Nomoshkor Kartavya dada.

Kartavya Sengupta: Oh Please, call me KS.

FN Reporter: Ok Mr. KS, so let’s get started. What do you feel about the role of government in education?

KS: I feel bad about it. I think education is being saffronized.

FN Reporter: Saffronized?

KS: Yeah, the other day I was passing by a school and kids were tearing each other’s notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Oh?

KS: Yeah and those notebook covers were saffron in color? Can anyone explain that?

FN Reporter: Perhaps that was just a color, perhaps there were other covers also with other colors.

KS: No, I just saw the school kids tearing covers and all of them were saffron. It is clear saffronization. And one thing is clear the kids, the students, they don’t like this saffronization. They just hate it.

FN Reporter: How do you know that they hate it?

KS: That’s the reason why they were tearing the covers. They hate the saffronization. They want the liberal thought. That tearing of notebook covers was an expression of angst among youth of this country.

FN Reporter: Oh come’on, this is a very weak argument?

KS: Ah you are calling my argument weak? Don’t you know that I am the Argumentative Indian?

FN Reporter: Well. I don’t mean ….

KS: No, I don’t blame you, I can see you are wearing a saffron kurta yourself.

FN Reporter: But this is off-white.

KS: Off-white? Perhaps, but there is a tinge of saffron in it at least to me it appears saffron.

FN Reporter: Did you have a color recognition problem ever in your life?

KS: Well at times yeah, I think things are saffron but they turn out to be white or dim yellow. I don’t know. But I still think those kids need saffron-neutral notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Let’s talk about your thoughts on economics.

KS: Oh please don’t get me started on how big of a consumer surplus are we missing out because of current government’s policies.

FN Reporter: But don’t you think by encouraging people to leave subsidies the government is cutting down on the subsidy wedge and in fact increasing the total societal benefit?

KS: Oh please don’t go to those demand supply curves. They are out with Keynes and his ilk. The obfuscation of prerogative rights to ‘denormalized’ priorities over geopolitical manifestations of ‘conglomeraticious’ designs is an apostle to the fact that the notion of utopia of equality has busted long back in time.

Indian flags were hoisted by some miscreants in two separate incidences in Delhi and Srinagar this afternoon. This is for the first time this year when Indian flags were hoisted in any rallies in both places, shocking the entire nation.

In Delhi, eyewitnesses told Faking News that soon after student were made to display the name of Mr. Fakriwal on placards in a stadium, clashes broke out between Mr. Fakriwal’s supporters and another group.

During the clashes, some youth, who were wearing masks and called themselves “patriots”, waved the Indian flag in the same stadium where the ceremony was on to felicitate Mr. Fakriwal for getting Delhi independence.

“How dare they! This is terrorism!” one Fakriwal supporter told this reporter, talking about attempts of the patriot group to unfurl Indian flag inside the stadium.

Instead of high flying name of a messiah, the sight of flying tricolor shocked many.

Soon afterwards, large posters across Delhi were put up blaming PM directly for this incidence. The posters mentioned “Pradhanmantri Sir! Plij! Hame placard lagane dijiye! Ham theek placard lage rahe hain.”

Ms. Falka Lamba (Chief Investigator of Mr. Fakriwal’s party and world record holder for the fastest healed head injury) said that they have started the investigations into the matter.

“Yes, a flag was hoisted by some youth inside the premises of this stadium and we are checking the video footage to identify which flag it was. We have registered an FIR with our internal police and are investigating. I will personally look into the matter and will throw away the billing machine ermm, I mean flag if I ever find it,” she said.

A subordinate of Mrs. Lamba, Asutosh showed confidence in Mrs. Lamba’s abilities and said, “Madam pakad lengi un atankiyon ko, kanoon ke hath bahut Lamba hote hain.. hehe“

The Delhi police is also investigating the Delhi incidence. It has been attempting to decipher the real meaning of Indian flags being waved at a stadium where felicitation for Mr. Fakriwal was going on.

According to preliminary reports, these patriotic groups were fed up of what they termed as narcissism and hypocrisy of Mr. Fakriwal, but such reports were rejected as “paid” by many commentators in media.

Indian flag was also waved in parts of Kashmir today, however Kashmir government spokesperson denied the presence of patriots in the state.

“You have to understand that no patriot has been identified so far in the valley. The flag of India was waved by some pandits who crossed the border and infiltrated from Jammu,” he told reporters.

But many Human Rights activists have condemned the incident.

“All our fears are coming true under Modi rule, not surprised at all this has come down to this,” Saakar Patel, part of Damnasty international told Faking News referring to the attack on local culture in Jammu & Kashmir.

“What next? Loud patriotic songs and Krantiveer on loop on local cable TVs in epicenteres of secularism? Is that the future we are heading too?” he asked with angst.

Dr. Amartya Sen, talking about these incidences on a panel discussion on TV said that the message is to threaten the very ideas of free thought and humanity and its terror attacks (Indian flag hoisting in this case) can not be tolerated in any civilized liberal society.

Dr. Sen further added, “Ethical hypocrisy is not an intellectual construct the ideologically minded understand and tolerate well, but honest duplicity is the essence of modern liberalism and we must protect it at any cost.”

We are still trying to figure what Dr. Sen said at the time of publishing this report.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tricolor-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-flags-waived-in-delhi-stadium-old-srinagar-on-independence-day-fir-registered-8284,"Indian flags waved in Delhi stadium & old Srinagar on Independence Day, FIR registered",,1439651047.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After claiming yesterday in parliament that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj held his hand, Rahul Gandhi today made one more claim.

Rahul claims that the speech note which he was carrying while entering into the parliament (captured excellently by Telegraph’s photographer Prem Singh), was in fact handed over to him by Sushma.

The leaked note!

“I am pretty sure when she held my hand to ask ‘Beta, why are you angry with me’, she also surreptitiously sneaked into that speech note in my hand, just like she secretly helped Lalit Modi. Now I get it why she was trying to get so close to me,” Rahul Gandhi said as he tore away the speech note before media. “She wanted me to learn history, but I didn’t know she was this hell bent that I do that.”

“It was clearly a ploy by Modi ji and Sushma ji to weaken my knowledge about history and deliberately hand me a note with all wrong information,” he went on to claim as Rajiv Shukla affixed scattered notes again, only to be torn again by Gandhi scion.

“Otherwise tell me who doesn’t know about Gandhi ji and his 4 monkeys,” Rahul added as he was interrupted by close aides.

When Faking News asked Rahul why did he still go ahead with that speech and claimed Gandhi ji has 3 monkeys, when he knew it was a ploy, he argued, “Because my daadi and mummy and papa have taught me to respect seniors, therefore I went ahead with incorrect information at my own expense.”

Later Rajiv Shukla also lambasted BJP for playing dirty politics.

“We all are aware that Shree Rahul Gandhi ji has a habit of carrying notes before giving speeches.

Several MPs have reported sore throats, throat infections and tonsillitis. Hence going forward Sonia and team plans to play Usha Uthup’s songs in loud volume to cause disruption in Parliament and forcing the speaker to adjourn the session.

Congress party spokesperson Dhananjay Jha spoke to media outside the Parliament and said, “Today when madam Sushma Swaraj was trying to speak, some of our MPs were constantly shouting ‘Sushma Chuppi todo (Sushma please speak)’, to prevent her from speaking. Since she did not stop speaking our MPs also continued shouting which proved counterproductive for a few of them. As soon as the session ended 35 of our 44 MPs collapsed due to extreme throat pain. They were immediately given medical care but the damage was done.”

He further continued, “Tomorrow our strategy will be different. We will ask the BJP leaders to speak-up and break their silence and as soon as they start speaking we will play Usha Uthup’s 17 songs back to back in full volume till the house is adjourned.”

“We have arranged for high quality Dolby Digital speakers usually used in IMAX like theaters for an Armageddon sound effect and also procured high quality amplifier equipment to give resonating beats to the background. This technique I believe hasn’t been used at all in the history of political protests anywhere in the world, and hence it will work razor sharp,” a confident Jha concluded.

While it is not yet clear on how the BJP government will respond to this audio onslaught by Congress, several BJP MPs have ordered huge bales of cotton for themselves.

The alleged letter contains a message asking Pichai to omit Modi’s achievements from Google search results.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai already having a headache after reading letters from Congress and BJP.

Speaking to Faking News, a senior Congress party leader said, “Congress party has always condemned the achievements of Modi Sarkaar. We have written to Mr. Pichai asking him to omit all the results related to BJP and Modi from Google search. We also made sure to include a special request: ‘All Modi searches should lead to hamaracongress.com’. I sincerely hope sanity prevails and Google updates its algorithms to achieve the same.”

Congress leaders have also asked the newly elected CEO to redirect all search results related to Narendra Modi to Gujarat riots. “We don’t want 2002 riots to fade away from public memory and we are doing all can to prevent that ‘maut ka saudagar’ tag from being wiped out. We are planning to use the same old ‘2002 riots’ strategy for 2019 elections too,” said a Congress leader.

As MPs were walking out of Lok Sabha to speak to a senior BJP leader and central minister who appeared ‘outraged’ in the beginning but ended up with a hysterical laugh.

“Being in Centre, we are planning to neutralize Congress’ letter by talking to Mr. Pichai on phone. Our request would have higher precedence for obvious reasons. The message we’re trying to convey is: ‘Redirect all Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi search results to their online scam records’. This is surely going to be #AccheDin for us and #BureDin for Congress”, said the senior leader as he boarded his car.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bhutanese-delegation-to-rajya-sabha-impressed-by-manmohan-singhs-silence-sitting-amidst-shouting-parliamentarians-8268,"New Delhi: A delegation from Bhutan landed in Rajya Sabha on Monday to take a look at the proceedings of Parliament houses of our country. They were impressed by the functioning of Rajya Sabha and they showed more eagerness in meeting our ex-PM Manmohan Singh.

“In our short visit to your country, we had seen a Silent Buddha and a Smiling Buddhu,” replied one junior delegate member, who knew Hindi.

Our reporter met with the Bhutanese delegation outside the guest houses where they were relaxing. A senior member of the delegation was kind enough to answer our questions.

When asked about their experience in Rajya Sabha, he said, “It was a scintillating experience, to say the least. We get to see Jackie Chan movies on laptops, but this is the first time, we saw some real action. The sound that we heard in that commotion is the loudest we had ever heard, apart from the sound of thunder and Arnab’s voice from TV sets in neighboring Assam taking our silent and serene nation like a thunderstorm.”

Taking a pause, he continued, “However, we found something very unique in all these disturbances. We believe that the left side portion of your House to be the ‘shouting portion’ and the right side to be the ‘silent portion’. As soon as your Speaker read about our visit, there was chaos and confusion in the left side. We saw everyone on the ‘shouting side’ shouting their lungs out. But, one person, with a turban on his head, he was very silent. We felt like he sat on the wrong side that day. He was seen sporting a spectacle and was wearing a blue turban. I could not recollect his name, but we had seen him in Bhutan few years ago.”

“Almost all of my friends felt astonished at the posture of that person. He was sitting like Buddha, so calm and peaceful, when there was chaos all around him. How can it be possible? We are totally impressed by him. We heard your PM Modi talk in our Parliament and we saw your Parliament too. From a land where people shout like they had swallowed loudspeakers, we are amazed to see such a calm and soothing face. He must be your national treasure,” concluded the old and wise Bhutanese delegate.

The delegation was later informed that he is none other than former PM Manmohan Singh. Delegates accepted that they could not remember, but added that ‘the delegation is eager to meet Manmohan Singh and hear his words’.

“Surely, his words must be most precious. Every word from a calm person is like a diamond found in river silt, my spiritual teacher told,” said another member of the delegation.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/parliament-300x127.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bhutanese-delegation-to-rajya-sabha-impressed-by-manmohan-singhs-silence-sitting-amidst-shouting-parliamentarians-8268,Bhutanese delegation to Rajya Sabha impressed by Manmohan Singh's silence sitting amidst shouting parliamentarians,,1439360681.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

It is still not known what unforeseen circumstances forced the two houses to work for a full day and the information is still elusive, however this unprecedented event caused unprecedented scenes in the capital.

Inhuman conditions as MPs made to work in the Parliament

Wife of a Rajya Sabha MP lodged a missing person complaint with local police station fearing the worst after her two time MP did not come home on usual time i.e. two hours after leaving home.

“He has been MP for two terms now and this had never happened before. He would be back by lunch hour every day during parliament sessions. He stayed out for long hours only after making stupid statements and then happily going from one TV studio to another. After I failed to find him on any TV, I panicked,” she said on being asked what triggered her to lodge a missing complaint.

Conspiracy theorists took to Twitter to offer some explanations. One Twitter user suggested that CIA had managed to replace the speakers of both houses with CIA clones so that Indians don’t give up on democracy and America’s plans of installing democracy in every part of the world was not derailed.

Another user postulated, “Or maybe it’s the ISI that has replaced speakers with ISI moles? They knew our poor MPs are not used to working at all, and if they are forced to work long hours they will tire and die. It could be a sophisticated terror attack on our honorable parliament!”

This theory was probably supported by 29 MPs being admitted to AIIMS after the session ended. Various MPs complained of fatigue after working unusually long working hours. Situation of one MP is said to be critical as he was made to read entire draft of one bill that was to be debated.

“I thought I was having a heart attack,” one MP told Faking News, “This is inhuman treatment, the speaker wants to kill us all.” These 29 MPs are planning to protest outside the parliament asking for resignation of speakers.

“If the speakers don’t resign, I will! I did not sign up for this anarchy and jungle-raj! Look around at all these MPs, they are all almost dead. Is this how a nation should treat its elected representative? 6 hour work days are unsustainable,” he added.

Although the events were totally unexpected, at least one MP, Mr. Ray Panda, had earlier opined that Parliament houses functioning for a full day every day was a good thing. “Every Indian works full day; they don’t get to disrupt and go home early. Parliament should never be adjourned, if MPs are shouting let them, work through the commotion, we should have a law that makes it mandatory for parliament to function minimum 8 hours everyday,” he said.

Sources later confirmed to Faking News that Mr. Ray Panda was unfriended by 280 MPs from Facebook the next day and was seen having unsubsidized lunch in the canteen the next day all alone.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lok-sabha-480-300x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-not-adjourned-for-a-day-29-mps-admitted-to-aiims-wife-of-one-lodges-missing-fir-in-panic-8266,"Parliament not adjourned for a day, 29 MPs admitted to AIIMS, wife of one lodges missing FIR in panic",,1439293000.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After condemning Delhi Police for manhandling and allegedly beating up former AAP leader and activist Yogendra Yadav, who was leading farmer’s protest, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has now argued that bouncers could have been used to kick Yadav out of Jantar Mantar.

“Bouncers are very human friendly people. I use their services time to time,” Kejriwal claimed as he recalled those meetings when bouncers were called to throw Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan out.

“I must come back to AAP,” Yogendra Yadav thinking.

“Instead of sending barbaric Delhi Police after Yogendra ji, Rajnath Singh and Modi’s agent cum Lt Governor Najeeb Jung could have used bouncers to dispel Yadav ji and his supporters, if at all there were any security related concerns,” Kejriwal said as he latched on to another opportunity to hit out at BS Bassi.

Kejriwal further claimed that unlike the morally corrupt and paid Delhi Police, bouncers were just aam aadmis and thus had the fundamental right to peacefully manhandle anybody.

“Delhi Police force is eating up jobs of bouncers. This proves how Modi is against ending ‘VIP’ culture,” Kejriwal told Faking News, as he left in his SUV to catch latest Bollywood film at PVR Director’s cut multiplex.

Yogendra Yadav too welcomed Kejriwal’s viewpoint and hoped to be manhandled by bouncers in future.

“I am not very used to being beaten up, dragged and manhandled by Delhi Police. However being a strong former leader in AAP, who held on to his stance despite Arvind bhai’s autocracy, I am quite used to being pushed out by bouncers,” Yogendra told Faking News while lying on his back at floor of Parliament Street Police Station.

When told that had he not exceeded the time frame for which he was permitted to protest by Delhi Police, such thing would not have happened, Yogendra nodded in agreement, looking little helpless.

“You can take a person out of AAP, but you can’t take the AAP out of a person,” Yogendra said as he tried to back to sleeping on floor.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hqdefault-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-condemns-delhi-police-for-manhandling-yogendra-yadav-says-bouncers-should-have-been-used-8267,"Kejriwal condemns Delhi Police for manhandling Yogendra Yadav, says bouncers should have been used",,1439286695.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After AAP’s lawmaker Alka Lamba claimed that she and her supporters vandalized the sweet shop as so as to take revenge for stone thrown at her, AAP govt has decided to pass ‘Right to Vandalize’ bill in Delhi.

The new act will allow people to go about vandalizing shops, public property etc, as long no lives are lost and no living being is injured.

“For safety of our MLAs and volunteers, so that they can go about vandalizing properties peacefully without any interruption, our CM Kejriwal ji has decided to fast track and pass this bill in next session of Delhi assembly,” cabinet minister and AAP MLA Satyendra Jain told Faking News.

Alka can’t believe what she did will be legal soon in Delhi.

“Janlokpal Bill can wait,” he quickly added, before our reporter could even ask about the status of pending promised bills by AAP during elections.

Though initially the act would allow vandalism as an act of revenge, but in due course it would even allow vandalism without any provocation and instigation.

“Even if we don’t pass this bill, just how do you expect a lawmaker to make laws until and unless he/she breaks one to find out loopholes in the existing laws?” forever furious Ashutosh asked, justifying Chandni Chowk MLA cum legislator Alka Lamba’s act.

Meanwhile talk of this new bill has given a ray of hope to veteran vandals across the country.

“We demand acquittal of all our party members arrested for those acts of vandalism where no living being was hurt,” said MNS and Shiv Sena, presenting a rare united front, “So many buses and autos that we burnt had nobody inside them. Then why are our lawbreaker abiding leaders being singled out?”

Unconfirmed sources say lawyer of Abdul Quadir Mohammed Younus Ansari from Raza Academy, arrested for damaging Amar Jawan Jyoti at Azad Maidan few years back, too will use the law to get bail for his client.

Surprisingly BJP too welcomed this decision by AAP govt and hoped for a reprieve from judiciary for their ex MLA Vijay Jolly accused of now a legal and respectable act of just painting somebody’s nameplate.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/483492714-268x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-govt-to-pass-right-to-vandalize-bill-in-delhi-8262,AAP govt to pass 'Right to Vandalize' bill in Delhi,,1439198423.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

AAP, doing what they do best. Sit on a dharna

Now in a recent press conference an AAP spokesperson made demands for handover of MOSSAD and CIA for maintaining law and order in Delhi. Here are the excerpts of the interview with their spokesperson Shri Jhootendra Imaandari with our chief reporter Bonobos.

Bonobos: Sir don’t you know that Delhi is not a full state and before fighting the Delhi elections were you not aware that Delhi police will not come under the state government?

AAP Spokesperson: We are very well aware of the fact dear. We were clear about this thing from the time we blamed Shiela Dixit ji for the law and order condition in Delhi.

Bonobos: Then why such demands, sir; when you know that it is not in the hands of state government and constitution needs to be amended for that.

AAP spokesperson: If we don’t make such demands how are we supposed to be a party with a difference? Don’t you remember how we resigned last time giving JAN LOKPAL as a reason although when we thoroughly knew that it could not be passed in state assembly? Same is the case with our demand of Delhi police.

Bonobos: Sir why demands for handover of Mossad and CIA, don’t you think that our Indian CBI along with control of Delhi police would have done the job of keeping Delhi safe?

AAP spokesperson: Although our CBI could also have helped with the job of making Delhi the safest city but we do not trust CBI as it comes under Central government. Anything related to central government is a roadblock for us. We are also planning to name speed breakers in Delhi roads as Jung, Modi, Meena and Bassi.

Bonobos: Do you think Israel and USA would agree to AAP’s demand to handover the MOSSAD and CIA to Delhi state government?

AAP spokesperson: It’s their call. We want them because they are the best in business. If they do not agree then we will start blaming Israel and USA for bad law and order conditions in Delhi. We are also tired of blaming Modi ji. Look if MOSSAD and CIA are under us, we do not need to install the 1500000 CCTV cameras as well, as we can use their advanced monitoring technologies. Still if USA and Isreal do not agree; don’t forget Jantar Mantar is booked by us for next 5 years.

Bonobos: What are your views on suspension of congress MP’s from the parliament and congress Dharna against the suspension?

AAP spokesperson: Congress is a copycat. Dharna is our domain. We are the ones who revived it. Congress has realized the power of Dharna after the results of Delhi assembly elections. It is the future of Indian politics. Let’s see how much they would be able to sustain with it. Look we learned the subsidy politics and secular politics from the Congress and in return taught them Dharna politics.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/aap.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-now-demands-handover-of-mossad-and-cia-to-them-8258,AAP now demands handover of Mossad and CIA to them,,1439096419.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After this statement all the beauty conscious ladies are confused as to who would be eligible and beautiful enough to qualify and roam around in Delhi. Everybody is holding their breath as what would be the eligibility criteria issued by AAP to judge if the women is beautiful or not.

Being Beautiful certificate issued by AAP

Putting an end to all the speculations an AAP spokesperson said in a press conference, “From the next month onward AAP would be issuing beauty certificates signed by Somnath Bharti to the ladies of Delhi. Full security would be provided to them to roam around in Delhi 24X7. As driving license is compulsory for driving, PAN card compulsory for financial transaction, Passport compulsory for going outside the country similarly ‘Being Beautiful’ certificates would be compulsory for women to roam around safely in Delhi. Issuing ‘Being Beautiful’ certificates will further enhance AAP’s tradition of giving certificates.”

Earlier also AAP has issued ‘Being Honest’ certificates to AAP members, ‘Being Corrupt’ certificates to non AAP members, ‘Being Communal’ certificates to nationalists ‘Being Secular’ certificates to likeminded parties and ‘Being Agent’ certificates to politicians. The entire task of printing and managing the certificates have been assigned to our documentation expert Jeetendra Tomar.”

After this statement women from entire India are looking forward to procuring this certificate. Femina has already issued a directive that from the next year Miss India title only girls having ‘Being Beautiful’ certificate issued by AAP would be eligible to participate.

Chunnu Bachelor has also said that he is going to marry a girl only if she has that AAPs ‘Being Beautiful’ certificate. A lot of marriage portals have declared discount of 50% on their membership fees for women having that certificate.

Many coaching classes have also come up to help ladies pass the Somnath Bharti’s beauty test and obtain the certificate.

According to his personal assistants, he was in deep thoughts about FTII.

Rahul Gandhi deeply wondering about something, which obviously will be something revolutionary, at least to Congress leaders.

While our attempts to talk with Rahul Gandhi failed, we met one of his personal assistant, who was free enough to praise the Congress Vice President. Speaking to Faking News, the unnamed assistant said, “Rahulji is now very tired after his brave talk at FTII. Opposing a fascist government obviously takes its toll on his young body. As you had asked me, he is in deep thoughts now. Whenever he raises his voice on an issue, he ventures into different areas of his brain and think about how to approach that issue. It was how he found out the famous punch lines ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ and ‘modi is trying to grab your land’.”

When we asked him to guess on what Rahul might be wondering, he grinned and said, “When we were driving back to hotel from FTII, he was in a similar deep thought experiment. Then, he turned back to me and said ‘I wonder why FTII is not following a democratic process similar to our party. It would had been easy, if there was planned succession in FTII. We should suggest this in Parliament. Look at our party. Do we have any of our leaders and workers raising war flags against appointment of me or my Mommy as High Command?’ When he finished talking, we had goosebumps. Such a revolutionary thinking he has. We are so blessed to work for him.”

“Just imagine, If FTII had Chairman for around 20 years, and the post is inherited by his daughter, then by her son and then by his wife and then by her son, similar to Congress, then nobody is going to raise voice against it,” said a senior Congress leader who was standing next to us.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rahul-Gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-wondering-why-ftii-didnt-follow-a-democratic-process-similar-to-congress-in-electing-its-head-8235,Rahul Gandhi wondering why FTII didn't follow a democratic process similar to Congress in electing its head,,1438491284.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sweets were distributed at various offices of INC as soon as the news surfaced that the space agency’s Kepler mission has found a planet outside solar system that may have volcanoes, oceans, sunshine and stupidity like Earth.

Rahul Gandhi is confident that he will make a comeback on Earth 2.0

According to NASA, this new planet named Kepler 452b is about 60% larger than the Earth, gravitational pull is twice that of earth and it has a year that lasts 385 days.

Congress, which lost almost every possible election that took place in the country after Rahul Gandhi came into the picture, is finally seeing a glimpse of hope.

“Rahul Gandhi’s dream to become the PM is alive again. Here, on Earth people know how big of a knucklehead Rahul Gandhi is but we are hopeful that the people of Kepler 452b don’t. It’s just that Rahul Gandhi needs to reach there before Narendra Modi does with a selfie stick in his hand,” a senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity.

“It’s just perfect for us. As everyone knows that Congress has enough money to move to Earth 2.0. We have capable people like Robert Vadra who can arrange land and all that. We can also take the very popular Arvind Kejriwal alongside us as he is always dying to do nothing but campaign against Narendra Modi. And look, 385 days a year, Rahul Baba will have more time for his vacations,” he further stated.

“And if we fail even there, we can easily blame the twice as much gravity for our downfalls.” He concluded.

Meanwhile, few of Congress activists are not so cheerful about it. “We will lose our jobs; I don’t know what we will do if Congress starts winning elections again.

A protest by Analog Aadmi Party against the digital India movement.

Analog Aadmi Party (AAP) has strongly condemned Digital India initiative terming it as classist and a disguised way of helping industrialists manufacturing digital equipment. They said this will only help rich people as common man still uses analog equipments like analog watches and radio.

Paparika Josh, a journalist world famous in India, came out with a tweet suggesting Government should have at least started Analog India initiative to maintain electronic fabric of India.

Bakshi Maharaj, a ruling party MP, strongly came out in support of the initiative stating that those who do not believe in digital should leave India. India was always a digital nation and will remain so.

Meanwhile, Kayawati has demanded reservations in jobs and education for those who still use analog equipments citing disproportionate investments in development of Digital Technologies as compared to Analog technologies.

Kayam Yadav has complained to Minority Commission, citing trampling on Analog enthusiast’s rights by the digital majority. He says only majority will benefit from this initiative.

Rahul Aandhi has put two conditions of supporting the initiative, first and foremost Chhota Bheem should be converted to digital format and second, Right to Digital should be passed in parliament give subsidies on iPhones to the poor people.

Ketan Fagat, world disowned writer, has said digital India will lead to increased pornography consumption. Anybody using digital technology is mostly male and frustrated and cannot get hands on even a half-girlfriend. These males will use digital technology to overcompensate their lack of social skills.

In another incident, an Analog extremist blew up a Digital store to record his protest. Analog timers were used for the act but Analog association says this act has nothing to do with Analog technology.

All these strong reactions highlight the divisive impact of Digital agenda. Embracing a technology with only two options 0 and 1 shows autocratic ‘my way or highway ideology’. It undermines the contribution of the all inclusive Analog technology which provides a continuum of options.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kejri.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/analog-aadmi-party-aap-condemns-digital-india-initiative-8208,Analog Aadmi Party (AAP) condemns Digital India Initiative,,1437887077.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

As she threatened to expose a Congress leader for seeking diplomatic passport for a coal scam accused, an embarrassed Congress quickly postponed the much publicized ‘Silent Protest’ and went back to the drawing board.

Deserted by its UPA-I and UPA-II allies on parliament disruption issue, Congress is looking for a solid cause that can unite the secular parties inside the lower house. They have finally found a topic that touches cords with all its allies – Subsidized food in parliament canteen. Congress VP Rahul Gandhi has asserted that they will not let the parliament function unless PM promises that subsidy on canteen food will continue.

Last week after huge uproar in social platforms and some online petitions, BJD MP Jay Panda wrote a letter requesting LS speaker to renounce the subsidy on food items. Initially everyone thought that this is another ‘brownie-point’ gathering exercise by Mr. Panda and soon people will forget about it. But as monsoon session drew near, they realized that shit has got real and something needs to be done.

Rahul Gandhi got twinkle in his eyes and dimple in his cheeks as he wasted no time in calling a press conference.

“Hume to pehle hi pata tha ki ye aadmi na khayega aur na khane dega. Aur bhaiya jaha tak khane ki baat hai, 67 saal me Congress ne kabhi bhi kisi ko nahi roka,” said Rahul Gandhi in a stern voice. While his party men started cheering, he was just unstoppable and went on offensive. He mocked PM for being silent.

“It is better for me and my party that Narendra Modi is silent,” Rahul Gandhi roared. “Err…Rahul Baba, other way round is also true. It’s better for Congress when you remain silent. You spoke in 2014 and we saw what happened,” said Shashi Tharoor who has still not finished responding to each individual praises he got on twitter for his excellent speech in Oxford reunion.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-scraps-monsoon-budget-and-winter-sessions-introduces-smoking-washroom-and-canteen-sessions-to-have-meaningful-parliamentary-discussion-8200,"New Delhi: In a move that could dramatically increase the productivity of the Parliament, BJP government is planning to scrap Monsoon, Budget and Winter sessions and planning to introduce Smoking, Washroom and Canteen sessions to have meaningful parliamentary discussion.

More meaningful sessions guaranteed.

Speaking to Faking News a source close to this development said, “The last few days have seen a lot of disruptions. The ruling government is concerned about the lack of meaningful discussions taking place in the Parliament. It has been observed that after Parliament is adjourned, members walk to the canteen, washroom and smoking area. It has also been noted that the level of discussion between the members is very meaningful unlike the ones in the Parliament.”

“There is a general sense of camaraderie among members when they are in these areas even if they belong to opposing parties. This has prompted the government to introduce new sessions in a bid to ensure productive work,” he added.

Many MPs welcomed this move saying that finally the government has come up with a good proposal. “I have been an MP for the last 10 years and have witnessed some really engaging discussions in the washroom. Infact PM’s ‘shauchalay yojana’ originated in the Parliament’s washroom,” said one MP.

Meanwhile, other MP’s have criticized the move saying this is another tactic by the ruling party to divide the people of this country like PM Modi is doing by selectively praising Shashi Tharoor.

Government is however very optimistic that this move will pay off. “It will not only make MPs happy but even Robert Vadra will not accuse us of using diversionary tactics during these sessions,” said one BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/canteen-smoking-washroom-300x122.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-scraps-monsoon-budget-and-winter-sessions-introduces-smoking-washroom-and-canteen-sessions-to-have-meaningful-parliamentary-discussion-8200,"Govt. scraps Monsoon, Budget and Winter sessions, introduces Smoking, Washroom and Canteen sessions to have meaningful parliamentary discussion",,1437721272.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-shift-parliament-to-mumbai-to-blame-citys-rains-for-disruption-of-monsoon-session-8198,"New Delhi: Concerned about rising criticism due to disruption of Parliament, government has come up with a unique solution to address the issue. Government plans to shift the Parliament’s monsoon session to Mumbai hoping to blame the city’s monsoon for lack of productive work.

Now MPs need not put so much effort to disrupt the Parliament. An easier way would be to blame it on Mumbai rains.

Speaking to Faking News a Member of Parliament said, “In the last couple of days, the Parliament has seen a lot of disruptions and more often the sessions have been adjourned. People are asking questions about the productivity of the Parliament. We thought it was time we needed a solution to justify this problem. So we came up with the plan of shifting the monsoon session to Mumbai.”

“It is a well known fact that during monsoon the normal pace of the city is disrupted. There are traffic jams, water logging, and transport services come to a standstill. We hope that the monsoon in the city can cover up for our lack of productivity too. I am waiting for the day when I can fearlessly address the media and say that the parliament was disrupted because of Mumbai’s monsoon,” he added.

Some MPs are not leaving anything to chance. They have submitted a proposal that the Parliament be located in Virar while they themselves stay at Colaba so that they can justify not attending work by blaming it on the long distance and traffic jams.

Meanwhile, a few MPs were excited at the prospect of monsoon session being shifted to Mumbai and were seen packing their bags already, hoping to do some sightseeing in their free time.

“We are concerned with disruption of session. We don’t care if it happens in Mumbai or Delhi. The good thing is that now we have an excuse. If the media wants to question, they can ask the rain gods,” said a visibly happy MP as he was busy checking out places to visit in Mumbai on his smartphone.

Experts say that the problem is with the naming of the session and shifting Parliament to Mumbai will not solve the problem. Budget and Winter Session’s will have similar problems as budget is understood by few people and in winter session most MPs will be in holiday mode.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bjp-mps-protest-disruption-of-parliament-by-congress-members-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-shift-parliament-to-mumbai-to-blame-citys-rains-for-disruption-of-monsoon-session-8198,"Govt to shift Parliament to Mumbai, to blame city’s rains for disruption of Monsoon Session",,1437643035.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/asteroid-on-collision-path-with-earth-takes-u-turn-after-it-is-severely-criticized-by-tv-expert-8194,"Gravity Space Station: An asteroid carrying 3.5 trillion dollar worth of precious metals which was originally headed for earth has changed its direction soon after veteran Indian politician Money Shanker Iyer was found criticizing the asteroid on national television. The asteroid has turned 180 degrees and is now seen moving away from earth. It is expected to collide with Jupiter now.

Collision averted thanks to Money Shankar Iyer

“This asteroid is nothing but a dog, a maniac and a maniac lame dog. It’s a snake whose head needs to be smashed. It’s a Persian messenger that needs to be kicked in the pit of death. I criticize it in most heinous words possible,” Iyer fumed in anger during an interview which was telecast across major news channels in India.

Soon after this interview Bhutan Indigenous Space and Technology Research Organization (BISTRO) released latest space captures of the asteroid, and a sharp turn in its path is clearly visible.

Daneesh Bagheria, chief research scientist at BISTRO explained these observations to media and said, “The talk show where Mr. Iyer took the case of poor asteroid was aired all across India at around 09:30 PM IST and the asteroid took a sharp turn at around 09:33 PM IST. These events which appear unrelated may actually be closely related.”

While Mr. Iyer has been known to severely criticize politicians, actors and other normal individuals across the country, this was the first time he criticized a heavenly body, such as an asteroid.

The repercussions of this U-turn by the asteroid were seen all across the globe. Research scientists at NASA who had been working on an anti-asteroid missile for months saw their whole effort go down the drain.

Cohen Johner, a senior astro-physicist at NASA expressed his dejection to media in following words, “It’s not only about millions of dollars we lost because the asteroid which we were trying to deflect changed its path on its own. It’s about lost dreams. The current ilk of young scientists at NASA are all kids of a generation which grew up watching Hollywood movies where NASA scientists created rockets that deflected asteroid and saved earth. That was the heroic victory we were aiming for. But some Indian politician just wakes up one day and beats the shit outta asteroid and the heavenly body just simply runs away? Our dreams of a heroic endeavor are crushed.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/asteroid.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/asteroid-on-collision-path-with-earth-takes-u-turn-after-it-is-severely-criticized-by-tv-expert-8194,Asteroid on collision path with earth takes U-turn after it is severely criticized by TV expert,,1437552439.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A Hindutvavadi was threatening to remove eyes of Shahrukh, when SRK said he can’t be controlled

Speaking to Faking News, Archana Singh said, “Today, I read an online review that Salman Khan was forced to play the role of Sanghi in his film, so that it can pass the Censor Board. It is widely known that Censor Board was hijacked by Sanghis who wanted to spread the ideology of RSS across the nation.

They want every other Indian to be a walking and talking Sanghi. Poor Salman Khan had to bend down and crawl to push his film for an Eid release. And by acting as a Hindutvavadi, Salman is made to lose his Muslim fan base, which was already usurped by Owaisi last year. This is indeed the start of Emergency as envisioned by our intellectuals.”

She continued, “You might wonder whether this is something specific to Modi. It can be, owing to the fact that, we are currently living in a fascist rule, where nobody can criticise this government and logoff Twitter peacefully. Coming back to the topic, this is not something new. During NDA rule under Vajpayee, RSS was indeed holding Bollywood film industry under its grip. They forced a Muslim, Shahrukh Khan, to produce and act in a movie called Asoka that has no Muslims appearing in the entire film.”

“Back then as a teenager, I was whistling and gushing at the charm of SRK. But, I got a chance to watch Asoka film few weeks back and I could now see a lot of Hindutva restrictions that were forced into that movie. The major point, as I said, there was not even a single Muslim in that film. Also, there were no Christians, and Sikhs. There is no depiction of minorities in a Bollywood movie that is supposed to cater to audience across all religions. Also, the movie ends with the protagonist embracing Buddhism. We should connect the dots here. Hope you remember the Rakhine riots in Burma, where Rohingya muslims were massacred. It has the involvement of Buddhist extremists. As birds of same feather flock together, a movie shows only Hindus and Buddhists; and a minority hero is forced to produce and act in the movie,” shrugged Archana with a bitter expression.

Before ending the interview, she said, “It is high time intellectuals, seculars and liberals of India unite and send a strong message to other secular nations of world and United Nations that artistic expression of India is in danger due to the rising Hindutva sphere of influence in almost all areas.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/18-300x128.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/similar-to-salmans-bajrangi-bhaijaan-even-srk-was-forced-to-make-asoka-with-no-muslims-appearing-in-that-film-to-appease-bhakts-film-expert-8186,"Similar to Salman's Bajrangi Bhaijaan, even SRK was forced to make Asoka with no Muslims appearing in that film, to appease Bhakts - Film Expert",,1437282554.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Bajrangi Bhaijaan Narendra Modi carrying an infiltrator safely back home to Pakistan

Speaking to the audience at Jammu University he said, “India has always faced the problem of infiltration from across the border. It is common knowledge that infiltrators have support of the Pak government. But whenever we confront the Pak government on this issue, they say infiltrators are non-state actors. Even infiltrators who are caught by the army play victims and say that they have lost their way. So I will personally ensure that each and every infiltrator is safely sent back to Pakistan.”

PM has called it ‘Ghar Wapasi Abhiyan’ and has asked the people of JnK to join him in helping all the poor infiltrators find their way back home.

Many infiltrators are happy with the PM’s assurance and hope they will get to see their family soon.

“I was picked up by Pakistani officials and asked to go against my will across the border. Now there is hope for us. We can look forward to Acche Din,” said a visibly happy infiltrator.

Meanwhile, Congress has called it another sham to divert attention of the people. Senior party leader Digvijay Singh questioned the PM’s intentions.

Knowing that politicians across the party lines take pride in showcasing their secular credentials PMO has decided to hold upcoming important meetings in between Iftar parties.

Iftar party or NITI Ayog meeting or both ?

PM Modi who is never keen on hosting or attending Iftar has agreed to it with heavy heart.

Since no secular politician wants to be seen missing from Iftar parties, we can expect a full house. Between the tasty bites of Haleem and Biryani, PM hopes to strike consensus on Land Aquisition Bill.

However skeptics are still not very positive about the idea of having Iftar with Modi. “What is he up to? I am sure he will take Selfie with all of us and upload it on twitter,” said one such skeptic.

He added, “If we are seen standing with Modi, the very purpose of attending Iftar will be defeated. Our secular credentials will be ruined forever.”

While all this was still getting finalized, NDTV tweeted that Iftar with PM will have a 30 minute mandatory Yoga session too. When confronted by Social Media Bhakts, they clarified that source of this news was an anonymous caller.

A representative from the channel said, “Since the news looked good enough to troll the government we didn’t bother to verify the sources and published it straightaway. Don’t worry, if it is not true, alert twitter users will automatically point out. We don’t have to waste our time in verifying the news.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Iftar-niti.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-to-hold-niti-ayog-meetings-during-iftar-party-to-ensure-participation-from-all-cms-8173,PM to hold Niti Ayog meetings during Iftar party to ensure participation from all CMs,,1437030635.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-phone-stops-working-reason-might-be-due-to-too-many-times-toggle-between-airplane-mode-on-and-off-8162,"New Delhi: According to our sources in PMO, the smart phone used by PM Narendra Modi which he purchased a year ago, has stopped working. It seems this happened when he was on his way to Russia from Kazakhstan to attend BRICS summit.

PM Modi needs a custom made smartphone

Faking News made an attempt to speak to PMO through its spokesperson to know more about this. However, most of our emails, calls, WhatsApp messages went unanswered. When Faking news was contemplating to file an RTI, we got one message through sms that read, “The phone which media is speculating is not working, is PM’s personal phone which is outside RTI’s ambit and official phone is with PM’s principal secretary most of the time.”

All the calls Faking News made towards official number went unanswered. It seemed that was phone was also switched off or with airplane mode settings as off.

Looking at the records, in last one year PM has visited close to 20 countries belonging to different continents. As per the norm most of the airlines request you to keep your mobile phone switched off or at least set the airplane mode settings as off when flight is taking off and landing. It is strictly enforced for the flights where PM is on board. In those flights one needs to keep phone with airplane mode settings as off for the entire duration of the flight due to security reasons.

Faking News met one of the experts on smartphone technology, Mr. Ragesh N. We started by asking, “Is there a link between changing airplane mode settings too many times and phone going bad because of this?”

Mr. Ragesh told us this might be the case, but it is very difficult to correlate unless he has all the details with him. Mr. Ragesh highlighted, “You need to remember PM is travelling to so many countries in short span of time. As he brings his phone back to network through airplane mode settings, he is bound to use network carriers of different countries as he is roaming. We cannot rule out, there might be a correlation between too much roaming and phone going bad. We need a thorough analysis. I have asked my testing department to help me on this. The challenge before us is, we cannot travel to so many countries to simulate this problem.”

Mr. Ragesh also pointed out in addition he is also doing research why the smart phones run out of battery while crossing five signals in Bangalore.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/namo-smartphone.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-phone-stops-working-reason-might-be-due-to-too-many-times-toggle-between-airplane-mode-on-and-off-8162,"PM’s phone stops working, reason might be due to too many times toggle between airplane mode on and off",,1436676692.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mp-government-bans-whistles-in-the-state-8159,"Bhopal. MP government announced a ban on whistles, effective immediately, read a press release from the government. The ban has been heavily advertised by the government in all the mainstream media including the daily newspapers. This morning’s headline in the state, almost everywhere, reads ‘MP bans whistles!’ A Faking News reporter mustered enough courage to directly talk to a government official on the ban.

FN: Good morning. As a new rule from press, we would like to frisk you for any untoward substance that you might inadvertently carry. Do we have your permission on that?

GO: Oh! No. Go right ahead. We are a transparent government. Got nothing to hide! On the other hand, we have to search you and your team if you are carrying any whistles. Search em boys! The GO gestured towards the team and after mutual frisking, the dialogue continued.

Not a safe thing to do

FN: A government banning whistles! Seems very unusual and eccentric even for a state like MP. GO: What’s unusual about it? The sounds from those whistles are annoying, you know. We have done extensive lab testing on both the whistles and the decibel level tolerance of a common man. Also on a politician, to test on a different breed and the results were shocking. Most of them could not stand the whistle sound and some of them reported to have immediate brain damage that stimulates violent behavior to attack the apparatus that makes the sound and anyone who is holding it.

FN: Wow! GO: Precisely the same expression we all had too! That’s when we decided to announce the ban on whistles, effective immediately. Whistle blowing in MP is not a child’s play anymore. It is henceforth statutorily deemed as a deadly sport. The government bans the activity and anybody found blowing a whistle will be arrested, if it is not too late; i.e. if the law of the land can beat the act of god.

FN: What you plan to do with all the whistles that are already in the shops in the state? GO: Like that 2 minutes noodles, the whistles will be recalled and destroyed. The government has hired a cement company to destroy the whistles for a paltry sum of Rs. 250 crores. Our strong and concrete relationship will certainly demolish those whistles into pieces.

At the end of the interview, the GO hummed a Hindi song in a visibly happy mood, and Faking News reporter just walked away, careful enough not to whistle along – clearly aware that not just whistling, even saying a word in MP can prove to be fatal.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whistleblower-300x152.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mp-government-bans-whistles-in-the-state-8159,MP government bans whistles in the state,,1436593258.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Pakistani PM was left red faced when newspapers back home reported how Indo-Pak ceasefire documents were recovered from a kabadiwala in Karachi.

Looking for Indo-Pak ceasefire document? Here it is

The request for ceasefire documents was conveyed by Pakistani Embassy in India after firing from Pakistan side was reported along the border. The Pakistan High Commissioner to India Mr. Abdul Basit asked for the documents after he was summoned by India government and asked to explain Pakistan’s position on the violation.

After the request was sent, officials in Pakistan started hunting for the documents which apparently were misplaced and landed up with a kabadiwala. Speaking to FN a government official on the condition of anonymity tried to explain how the vital documents ended up in scrap. He said, “Our government offices are full of junk files. There is no space for anymore files. Tell me, if govt. offices are used for keeping files, where do we keep our guns. So our government took a decision to sell all files in scrap so that we have space to keep our ammunition.”

Pakistani officials have promised their Indian counterpart that the matter will be taken up seriously like all other previous bilateral matters provided they receive ‘credible evidence’ from India. They have also promised action against erring government officials who are responsible for the negligence.

Meanwhile, Indian Army has said that it is relieved that the documents have been found and at least now the Pakistani army will know that there is something called ‘ceasefire’ that exists between the two nations.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kabadiwala.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/major-embarrassment-for-nawaz-sharif-as-indo-pak-ceasefire-documents-recovered-from-a-kabadiwala-in-karachi-8154,Major embarrassment for Nawaz Sharif as Indo-Pak ceasefire documents recovered from a kabadiwala in Karachi,,1436511420.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After allocating a whooping 526 crores for information and publicity in current financial year, AAP has now decided to hire Aamir Khan as party’s brand ambassador and marketing strategist.

Party now claims that such high amount was set aside only because half of it was to pay fees of Aamir Khan.

“Mainu o munda chaihda haiga”

“Our publicity seeking tactics have now become old. Voters are able to see through such gimmicks. We need innovation in the way we advertize our self. That is why we have decided to rope in the perfectionist Aamir Khan, who is widely regarded as the marketing genius in Bollywood,” Manish Sisodia told Faking News, “Also he agreed to work on subsidized fees for us.”

“Being an honest man and a highly secular person, Kejriwal ji enjoyed movie PK to the fullest and was amazed at how effortlessly Aamir was able to pull off publicity for the film, keeping it different from all his previous films,” Ashutosh told Faking News, when asked how was Aamir’s name finalized.

AAP is now confident that all the flak that it is facing for spending so much on itself will subside once Aamir is on board.

“Aamir has enough goodwill among the masses in India. Therefore anything that he preaches or imparts is grabbed by them without questioning his hypocrisy. This is something we have been lacking of late,” admitted Ashish Khetan.

If sources are to be believed, AAP wants Aamir to publicize party in the same fashion as he anchors his show Satyameva Jayate.

“Wouldn’t it be nice and sensational, if Aamir were to present work done by us not done by BJP ruled MCD in Delhi by saying stuff like ‘Aayie dikhaate hain aap logo kuch chaukan dene wale gandgi aur bhrashtachaar ke aankde’ or ‘Chaliye baat karte hain us bikhaari se jisne 5 rupay de kar Kejriwal ji ki aankhon mein aansoo bhar diye’,” Ashutosh asked our reporter.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kejri-aamir_650_021015064338-300x192.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-govt-to-hire-aamir-khan-for-publicity-half-of-526-cr-to-be-paid-as-professional-fees-8146,"AAP govt to hire Aamir Khan for publicity, half of 526 cr to be paid as professional fees",,1436342967.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An adamant Lalu Yadav speaking to the media and putting forth his demand for money

Not to be left behind, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has claimed his rightful Rs 4 lakh. Speaking to Faking News he said, “Nine children ka father hai hum, batao kitna paisa banta hai hamara. Dus lakh banta hai na. Hum Uddhav Thackeray sahab se request karta hu ki woh humko hamara paisa de.“

But Shiv Sena spokesperson has flatly refuted Lalu Yadav’s claim saying, “Our scheme is only valid for a family that has five kids, which are born between 2010 to 2015. Lalu Yadav doesn’t fit that criterion.”

BJP parliamentarian Sakshi Maharaj has welcomed this move of Shiv Sena and said, “I am very glad that Shiv Sena has set the threshold to 5 children. It is one more than the minimum-children (four) that a Hindu woman should have to protect Hinduism and Sanatan Dharma.”

Meanwhile, Mulayam Singh Yadav has raised doubts over this scheme and said it defies his logic. Speaking to party workers he said, “A man can never have four children from a single woman. It is not practical. This scheme is vague and purposeless. Since no one can ever have five children from a single wife, everybody will violate preconditions of this scheme.”

Experts are of the opinion that it is a politically motivated move by Shiv Sena and likely to cause polarization in Bihar before the assembly election. Sonia Gandhi has alleged and said, “Polarization is BJP’s masterstroke to win elections.”

She further added, “A Yale study confirms that my allegations are genuine.”

Lalu Prasad, however was adamant and said, “Either give me Rs 4 lakh or abort this scheme.”

VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi too had a few words to say. While supporting this scheme she said, “People who are opposing this scheme should go to Pakistan.”

Lalu’s demand on this issue has given birth to another protest. Parents who have only four children born between 2010 to 2015, are now demanding that the applicability period of this scheme be extended by 9 months.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lalu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lalu-claims-rs-4-lakh-following-shiv-senas-announcement-of-rs-2-lakh-reward-for-every-hindu-family-which-has-five-children-8341,"Lalu claims Rs 4 Lakh following Shiv Sena's announcement of Rs 2 Lakh reward for every Hindu family, which has five children",,1441178495.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Hardik Patel gives 1 day ultimatum to IRCTC for his ticket reservation.

“Even after trying for 3 hours at a stretch I was not able to book 3 berths in 3rd AC. I was so fedup that I threw the laptop in the flames of the bus which our brothers had just burnt,” Hardik fumed in anger and told reporters. He further told reporters that he had to then book 3 business class airline tickets using his iPhone 6 using his platinum credit card.

After sipping his Diet-Pepsi he further threatened, “If IRCTC does not let me book tickets, I will ask my millionaire NRI Patel brothers to not invest in coal mines in India anymore. No investment, no workers, no coal, no rails. Further we will not even supply a single drop of milk to railways. Good luck to railway passengers with no cups of semi-cold tea-coffee during those long rail journeys.”

Hardik’s followers were apparently so outraged at his not getting a reservation at IRCTC website that they took out their anger on anything remotely related to websites and internet. They ended up ravaging 2 cyber-cafes, 3 laptop showrooms and 5 computer accessories shops where they burned numerous laptops, crushed hard-disks and even chewed LAN cables. No arrests however have been made in this case as yet.

However the repercussions of this incident were felt throughout the country. A lot of secular liberal political leaders have come in Hardik’s support after this incident. They have condemned IRCTC for depriving a poor minority of his rights to commute at reasonable prices and forcing him to travel business class.

Meanwhile, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal has sent his party worker to Gujarat to have talks with Hardik Patel and check if providing WiFi to Gujarat will solve the problem.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hp3.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/hardik-patel-fails-to-get-reservation-on-irctc-followers-burn-laptops-chew-lan-cables-8328,"Hardik Patel fails to get reservation on IRCTC, followers burn laptops, chew LAN cables",,1440741987.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwals-covert-operation-to-unearth-corruption-of-lalu-and-nitish-by-appearing-to-be-their-ally-8323,"New Delhi/Patna: Delhi CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal lent his support to Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav for the upcoming Bihar elections. While this is seen as a move to defeat BJP in Bihar, many anti-corruption crusaders who supported Kejriwal were disappointed by his move.

Kejriwal to Nitish, “You take this chair now, I will take your chair later.”

Our Investigation team seeks to expose the covert operation of Arvind Kejriwal in nabbing the famous corrupt Lalu and his new dost Nitish Kumar.

First, our investigation team tried to contact several important heads in AAP to find out the reason behind Kejriwal’s sudden friendship with Nitish-Lalu.

“Initially, I could not believe that our Kejriwalji was going to team up with Nitish-Lalu. We were anxious over how to take forward our anti-corruption movement. But, one of our members from the top brass who is in direct touch with Kejriwal cleared all our doubts. Kejriwal is on a secret operation to nab the duo. He will try and move closer to them and will win their confidence. And finally, he will go to the depth of the corruption and bring out the corrupt. Our Kejriwalji is more like Radhe of Wanted. He acted like a ruffian to bring the evil ruffians to jail, our leader will act as an ally of corrupt to send the corrupt behind bars,” said one leader from Delhi unit, on conditions of anonymity.

After gathering this explosive info, we then confirmed this with several other state unit leaders of AAP. Bihar unit leaders also sounded affirmative on this info.

One top leader of Bihar unit said, “This is a covert operation. I hope that you don’t publish this. First, Arvind will try to find out important contacts in the Nitish-Lalu duo’s camp. Then, he will track down the list of politicians and their benamis. Finally, all the routes of corrupt money will be traced and a big dossier will be prepared.”

“But we have planned to stay mum on the whole covert ops till the announcement of Bihar election results. By then, Kejriwalji would have defeated BJP in the elections. After the win, Kejriwal will expose the corruption history of Nitish and Lalu. Then, they will be sent to jail and Kejriwal will be coronated as CM of Bihar. He will be functioning as CM of both Bihar and Delhi. If Bihar governor tries to intervene Kejriwal, then he must be mostly a Modi agent, like LG Najeeb,” concluded the Bihar AAP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/arvind-kejariwal-nitish-kumar-300x207.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwals-covert-operation-to-unearth-corruption-of-lalu-and-nitish-by-appearing-to-be-their-ally-8323,"Arvind Kejriwal's covert operation to unearth corruption of Lalu and Nitish, by appearing to be their ally",,1440657726.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/we-cancelled-talks-with-india-as-kashmiri-pulao-was-not-on-lunch-menu-nawaz-sharif-8311,"Rawalpindi: In another bizarre explanation that has shocked the world, Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has reportedly blamed the lunch menu on NSA meeting for cancellation of talks with India. This out-of-the-box blame follows after his weird explanation on their rejection of Indian sweets offered by BSF.

Nawaz disappointed with NSA lunch menu

The menu was made public by the government as soon as the talks were cancelled. To provide more information, it was a typical lunch menu with Cucumber-Onion Salad, choice of Roti/Naan, Dal Makhni, Mutter Paneer, Malai Kofta, Aloo-Dum Biryani, Chicken Biryani and Murg Musalam.

The famous dish often seen during Indo-Pak meetings: Kashmiri Pulao, was clearly missing this time.

Speculations are that India wants Pakistan to forget about Kashmir and doesn’t want to compromise on this at any cost.

Speaking to Faking News reporter, a security official said, “There was an exclusive, pre-defined agenda set for these talks and we wanted to do our best not to shift focus towards otherwise common diversions like Bollywood, cultural exchange, chaman ki aasha and so on.

Moreover, Sharif himself had revealed the secret of their diabetic condition recently. So, you tell me, what purpose would a sweet pulao offered to diabetic people serve?”

Reactions poured in from the Sharif camp as well. One of their officials said, “Deliberate omission of Kashmiri Pulao and at the same time, including Balochi Fried Rice is clearly a conspiracy to avoid the issue spanning over decades. Like we said earlier, we are doing our best in tackling terrorism. If you’re looking for proof, please check with the survey agency that has recently included Pakistan in world’s 100 safest places to stay.”

It is being believed that separatists were sent parcels of Biryani made in Hyderabad’s Paradise Hotel. This was to ensure they had delicious lunch at their respective homes in the guise of house arrest.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nawaz-sharif-pensive-183250-184501-186989-640x480-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/we-cancelled-talks-with-india-as-kashmiri-pulao-was-not-on-lunch-menu-nawaz-sharif-8311,We cancelled talks with India as Kashmiri Pulao was not on lunch menu: Nawaz Sharif,,1440400241.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,"New Delhi: The Indian Government’s enthusiasm in its foreign policy has prompted many developments. The most recent is a joint working group setup to do a feasibility study for a possible India-Pakistan Free Terrorist Agreement (FTA). Terrorism is becoming a global industry, and hence, the increasing world consensus is towards enabling free competition of terrorist organizations, without interference from governments. A slew of allegations from both sides on anti-competitive terrorist practices is believed to be the main reason behind this development. An FTA with Pakistan would mean that terrorism will have open borders. The Indian side is represented by the Indian Insecure Mujahidin (IIM), while Taliban-ka-Baap (TKB) is the chief negotiator from Pakistan’s side.

India’s concerns

As per “terror-leaks”, certain confidential documents highlight concerns raised by India’s chief negotiator on good and bad terrorism. India is particularly concerned about the recent quality of terrorism exported from Pakistan into India. On the issue of Naved, who was recently caught by India in Udhampur, India’s chief negotiator lamented, “We are really concerned about the quality of terrorists imported from Pakistan. They are turning out to be plain duds, and spoil the image of all of us. They take all the limelight and credit too. The Indian terrorist ecosystem has just begun to evolve, and the domestic terrorist industry must be protected. We find it hard to compete with the buffoonery of Pakistani terrorists. Too much unnecessary heropanti. ”

The Indian side has hinted that they will undertake activities to sabotage Pakistani terror’s India expansion plans. Sources have revealed that the major method of doing so would be by secretly infiltrating the Pakistani terrorist supply chain. Once done, Pakistani terrorists will be unknowingly supplied fake grenades, AK-47 pichkaris, maps with Afghanistan labelled as India, and exploding walkie-talkies. The IIM representative feels that though this is an unfair move, it is an opportunity for IIM terrorists to become martyrs (they will die laughing).

Pakistan’s concerns

The Pakistani side, on the other hand, raised the issue of domestic market saturation. Too many terrorists and too many terrorist activities are forcing the terrorism behemoth to focus on export-led growth. They also feel that saffron groups & Maoists are increasingly taking centre stage in the media.

“We know that we are the best. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Just look at what e-Commerce is doing to the retail industry. We are slowly becoming a commodity. We want to constantly innovate to maintain our leadership – both in the media, and on the stupidity scale,” reasoned the TKB representative.

Global terrorist agreements

Amidst the ongoing negotiation is the threat of a mega free terrorist pact that ISIS is negotiating with various other countries like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. IIM claims that infrastructure bottlenecks and old video technology has rendered them uncompetitive compared to ISIS and the government should provide some domestic support (read subsidies) to the domestic industry. This is expected in the form of HD cameras, as well as English classes. The All India Terrorist Association (AITA) in a representation to the GOI has expressed its concern over the “huge capacity overhang” in ISIS which could “kill” Indian industry.

They have also highlighted that apart from ISIS, India also faces stiff competition from Pakistan and should get a level playing field in order for them to compete with Pakistan as they receive around 30% of their GDP as subsidies from the Pakistani government while in India this number is 0.

The Indian government has said that they are “sympathetic” towards the concerns of the industry but now the Indian domestic industry should get ready for reduced tariff lines and high quality imports of “good terrorist” into India as the free terrorists pacts are a reality. The protectionist policy of the previous government will not be tolerated by the new government.

A new era of competitive terrorism

We hope that unlike Free Trade pacts, India does not lose out in terms of negotiations of Free Terrorist Agreement. Many experts have highlighted the India’s “terrorist” deficit has increased fourfold in the past decade and Indian domestic industry has suffered on this count. So the endeavour should be to “Make in India” rather import into India.

AITA, has also said that it will also align itself to the “Skilling India” campaign so as to promote domestic skill development and ensure employability of fresh terrorists. A phased introduction of the FTA would ensure that the domestic industry has a chance to develop itself, and not to always be a cry-baby.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sartaz_aziz-300x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/talks-begin-on-the-india-pakistan-fta-free-terrorist-agreement-8309,Talks begin on the India-Pakistan FTA (Free Terrorist Agreement),,1440305755.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

On one hand are the people who devotedly supported his every act of crime and corruption even when courts convicted him. On the other hand he has self-styled anti-corruption flagbearer Arvind Kejriwal, who according to media reports is ready to take the anti-corruption movement in Bihar by campaigning for RJD.

Both began as anti-corruption crusaders and then…

This news has put the second layer of RJD leaders in spot. They are at loss of words to explain the core voters whether the party stands for corruption or against it. With the leadership getting confused and core voters getting disillusioned there is a growing fear of revolt in the ranks sooner or later.

Pappu Yadav, an RJD leader who is accused in multiple scams and murders openly questioned Lalu, “Joining hands with Nitish Kumar, who beat us black and blue in last state election, may still not hurt RJD’s political DNA. But how do we explain our voters about getting support from AAP? AAP takes pride in being against corruption and we do exact opposite. We all have seen the big banners in Delhi that say Kejriwal has reduced corruption in Delhi. If he does the same here, what will our kids eat? Lauki?”

Sensing the growing discomfort in party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav called on Nitish Kumar to ensure that AAP is kept away from campaigning in 100 seats that RJD’s is fighting.

Meanwhile AAP supporters are not much bothered about Kejriwal’s decision to support an alliance comprising of RJD and Congress, two parties which were considered full of corrupt and criminals respectively.

“At least he is doing something. What is Modi doing except travelling abroad and taking selfies? Since Kejriwal has not kept any portfolio with him and Modi is not letting him do any other work, he is reviewing movies to kill time. So even if he goes to Bihar, no work will get stuck in Delhi,” remarked an ardent AAP supporter from Lajpat Nagar.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CM4EPtAUYAEdvrY-300x153.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taking-support-from-aap-is-against-our-political-dna-senior-rjd-leaders-warn-lalu-8306,"Taking support from AAP is against our political DNA, senior RJD leaders warn Lalu",,1440227866.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,"Mumbai: A day after Mulayam Singh said that it was ‘practically not possible for four men to rape a woman’, Valmiki Gopal, also known as ‘The Mumbai Masturbator’ has sought a certificate of innocence from Mulayam Singh.

Certificate of Innocence

Speaking to Faking News from Mumbai he said, “All I did was masturbate and we all do that, albeit discreetly. But look how the media is painting me as a villain. I can’t believe I am living in the same country, where in one state the authorities are defending the rapists while in another the CM is swiftly taking action against me for masturbating in broad daylight.”

“I was humiliated on social media with my pic going viral. I was not given a chance to explain my position. No one calls me by my real name now. They all call me ‘mumbai masturbator’. My reputation is tarnished, so I seek an ‘innocence certificate’ from Mulayam Singh,” he said.

Valmiki was also dejected with the attitude of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis for initiating swift police action.

“I just took a ‘hard stand’ against the porn ban and decided to protest in my way. This government is not allowing peaceful protests now. I think emergency days are back,” he added.

Apparently, Valmiki is planning to leave Mumbai for good and relocate to Uttar Pradesh. “No point staying here anymore. At least I can live with some respect and dignity in Uttar Pradesh. I am pretty sure Mulayam Singh won’t treat me like this if I feel like masturbating there. I have spoken to few people from UP who were accused of rape and they said, ‘koi tension wali baat nahi bhaiyyaji naam se hi nahi kaam se bhi mulayam hai’.”

When FN tried to contact Samajwadi Party spokesperson for their response on Valmiki Gopal’s request, the spokesperson acknowledged that they had indeed received a request from the aforementioned person.

“We are looking into the matter. Mulayamji has to look into the practicalities of the situation before taking any decision. Next week he will be handing out innocence certificates to rape convicts, probably he will give an official statement then,” said the spokesperson.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ceritficate-of-innocence.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-masturbator-seeks-innocence-certificate-from-mulayam-singh-8299,Mumbai masturbator seeks 'Innocence Certificate' from Mulayam Singh,,1440058980.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The stalemate between the Govt and students at FTTI prompted Arvind Kejriwal to use this opportunity to teach the students intricacies of film making.

Speaking to Faking News from New Delhi, the AAP chief said, “It’s not a case of political opportunism, I am deeply concerned about the future of the students at FTII. If these students don’t get the right environment to study, we’ll have mindless movies flooding the market. AAP has all the resources to start a Film Insititute here in Delhi. Our own party workers have hands on experience in drama and will form the core faculty.”

When questioned about the name of the institute he replied, “We are planning to name the institute as AAP Institute of Drama Study (AIDS). Our first institute will be located in Delhi and later we intend to spread AIDS across the country.”

Our sources within the party tell us that AAP leader Ashutosh with take up session on drama and the teach students how to emote in front of the camera while Kumar Vishwas will take session on make-up and beauty.

Students will also be shown audio-visuals of Parliament sessions to help them understand the nuances of drama.

As part of their summer projects, the students will be creating ads for the party and the best ad will get a chance to be featured on TV channels. Arvind Kejriwal will himself review all summer projects, like he has done with the release of Bollywood movies on Friday.

Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami has also been roped in as guest faculty.

FTII students too are happy. Rakesh Kumar, who joined FTII in 1992 said, “I my 23 years as a student at FTII, I have never witnessed something like this before, referring to the FTII deadlock.

PM Modi pointing towards a location on the map, giving an indication about his next trip.

According to Mr. Patra, “When Amazon or Flipkart advertise for a mega sale, people rush to buy as if there is no tomorrow. They never give a thought whether the product they are buying will be of any use or not. The other day one of my esteemed colleague working in a startup bought 4 pairs of black leather shoes and 6 pairs of Peter England shirts and formal trousers.”

While explaining frequent overseas visits by the PM, he said, “Modiji has travelled across whole world to bring laurels for the country. Because of these trips it’s natural, you will get good amount of frequent flyer air miles. May be many are not aware of this, these air miles will expire by end of this month as festival season is starting from next month and airlines expect occupancy rate to go up and they do not have to give too many freebies.”

Mr. Patra added, “I am confused, what is the problem if someone is redeeming those miles to make short trips like UAE one which our PM did recently. Though he did not speak, he was present in India when parliament session was going on. He conserved his energy to give us a speech to remember from Red Fort on Independence Day. After that went abroad only for 2 days and immediately back to his business. I find it strange, instead of appreciating this, some are criticizing.”

Mr. Patra told our reporter, “Most of us know this, and still let me clarify once more. Frequent flyer air miles can be used to access the airport lounge, upgrade the travel class and so on. These things are anyway available free for PM of any country. The major cost is the ticket cost for which some of the tax payers are complaining. For UAE trip the full ticket cost we saved by redeeming the miles. Still we have enough miles to arrange one free trip to Bhutan.”

When we asked Mr. Patra about the complaints by opposition he said, “They should be the last people to complain about our tax payer’s money. Because of them complete monsoon session was a wash out. They have no Idea, UN has made our PM as the ambassador for their new tourism initiative called Incredible World.”

Mr. Dhananjay Jha of Congress has criticized BJP spokesperson’s statement that they have no Idea. Mr. Jha told us, “As usual BJP is once again wrong with the facts. I have three connections of Idea, so many from my party use Idea phone, even Rahulji is using Idea phone for accessing IIN service. I would urge my close friend Mr. Patra for whom I have highest regard to do his homework properly before commenting on Congress party.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/modi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/do-not-complain-if-you-have-no-idea-modi-is-doing-short-trips-like-uae-one-to-redeem-the-air-miles-before-they-expire-bjp-spokesperson-8296,"Do not complain if you have no Idea, Modi is doing short trips like UAE one to redeem the air miles before they expire: BJP spokesperson",,1439968657.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mulayam Singh Yadav: He would hold meeting with opposition parties in UAE for a possible third front alliance in India to stop communal forces from winning more elections. It will be called ‘Great Grand Alliance’ or ‘Ultra Janta Parivaar’.

Sharad Pawar: He will further strengthen his secular credentials by meeting Sheikhs and learning about their lifestyle, bank accounts and way they control natural resources.

Arvind Kejriwal: After waiving electricity bills for defaulters in Delhi, Kejriwal with an eye on 2019 Lok Sabha elections now intends to win over hearts of NRIs in UAE and will therefore demand waiver of their electricity and water bills from UAE govt.

Vasundhra Raje: With Rajasthan Cricket Association suspended by BCCI to host any IPL matches, Raje would ask UAE govt to let Rajasthan Royals hosts matches there. She will however deny that this demand has got anything to do with Lalit Modi.

Rahul Gandhi: He intends to go there and gatecrash random Indian households to have dinner with them. He will further even ask for more salaries to be given to NRIs working under Adani. However for the sake of Muslim vote bank in India, he will refrain from doing women empowerment there.

Jayalalitha: She will go on a study tour the jails of UAE and would implement the same facilities back in jails of Tamil Nadu, since she is quite a regular visitor there.

Faking News Reporter: Nomoshkor Kartavya dada.

Kartavya Sengupta: Oh Please, call me KS.

FN Reporter: Ok Mr. KS, so let’s get started. What do you feel about the role of government in education?

KS: I feel bad about it. I think education is being saffronized.

FN Reporter: Saffronized?

KS: Yeah, the other day I was passing by a school and kids were tearing each other’s notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Oh?

KS: Yeah and those notebook covers were saffron in color? Can anyone explain that?

FN Reporter: Perhaps that was just a color, perhaps there were other covers also with other colors.

KS: No, I just saw the school kids tearing covers and all of them were saffron. It is clear saffronization. And one thing is clear the kids, the students, they don’t like this saffronization. They just hate it.

FN Reporter: How do you know that they hate it?

KS: That’s the reason why they were tearing the covers. They hate the saffronization. They want the liberal thought. That tearing of notebook covers was an expression of angst among youth of this country.

FN Reporter: Oh come’on, this is a very weak argument?

KS: Ah you are calling my argument weak? Don’t you know that I am the Argumentative Indian?

FN Reporter: Well. I don’t mean ….

KS: No, I don’t blame you, I can see you are wearing a saffron kurta yourself.

FN Reporter: But this is off-white.

KS: Off-white? Perhaps, but there is a tinge of saffron in it at least to me it appears saffron.

FN Reporter: Did you have a color recognition problem ever in your life?

KS: Well at times yeah, I think things are saffron but they turn out to be white or dim yellow. I don’t know. But I still think those kids need saffron-neutral notebook covers.

FN Reporter: Let’s talk about your thoughts on economics.

KS: Oh please don’t get me started on how big of a consumer surplus are we missing out because of current government’s policies.

FN Reporter: But don’t you think by encouraging people to leave subsidies the government is cutting down on the subsidy wedge and in fact increasing the total societal benefit?

KS: Oh please don’t go to those demand supply curves. They are out with Keynes and his ilk. The obfuscation of prerogative rights to ‘denormalized’ priorities over geopolitical manifestations of ‘conglomeraticious’ designs is an apostle to the fact that the notion of utopia of equality has busted long back in time.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-flags-waived-in-delhi-stadium-old-srinagar-on-independence-day-fir-registered-8284,"Srinagar/Delhi. Indian flags were hoisted by some miscreants in two separate incidences in Delhi and Srinagar this afternoon. This is for the first time this year when Indian flags were hoisted in any rallies in both places, shocking the entire nation.

In Delhi, eyewitnesses told Faking News that soon after student were made to display the name of Mr. Fakriwal on placards in a stadium, clashes broke out between Mr. Fakriwal’s supporters and another group.

During the clashes, some youth, who were wearing masks and called themselves “patriots”, waved the Indian flag in the same stadium where the ceremony was on to felicitate Mr. Fakriwal for getting Delhi independence.

“How dare they! This is terrorism!” one Fakriwal supporter told this reporter, talking about attempts of the patriot group to unfurl Indian flag inside the stadium.

Instead of high flying name of a messiah, the sight of flying tricolor shocked many.

Soon afterwards, large posters across Delhi were put up blaming PM directly for this incidence. The posters mentioned “Pradhanmantri Sir! Plij! Hame placard lagane dijiye! Ham theek placard lage rahe hain.”

Ms. Falka Lamba (Chief Investigator of Mr. Fakriwal’s party and world record holder for the fastest healed head injury) said that they have started the investigations into the matter.

“Yes, a flag was hoisted by some youth inside the premises of this stadium and we are checking the video footage to identify which flag it was. We have registered an FIR with our internal police and are investigating. I will personally look into the matter and will throw away the billing machine ermm, I mean flag if I ever find it,” she said.

A subordinate of Mrs. Lamba, Asutosh showed confidence in Mrs. Lamba’s abilities and said, “Madam pakad lengi un atankiyon ko, kanoon ke hath bahut Lamba hote hain.. hehe“

The Delhi police is also investigating the Delhi incidence. It has been attempting to decipher the real meaning of Indian flags being waved at a stadium where felicitation for Mr. Fakriwal was going on.

According to preliminary reports, these patriotic groups were fed up of what they termed as narcissism and hypocrisy of Mr. Fakriwal, but such reports were rejected as “paid” by many commentators in media.

Indian flag was also waved in parts of Kashmir today, however Kashmir government spokesperson denied the presence of patriots in the state.

“You have to understand that no patriot has been identified so far in the valley. The flag of India was waved by some pandits who crossed the border and infiltrated from Jammu,” he told reporters.

But many Human Rights activists have condemned the incident.

“All our fears are coming true under Modi rule, not surprised at all this has come down to this,” Saakar Patel, part of Damnasty international told Faking News referring to the attack on local culture in Jammu & Kashmir.

“What next? Loud patriotic songs and Krantiveer on loop on local cable TVs in epicenteres of secularism? Is that the future we are heading too?” he asked with angst.

Dr. Amartya Sen, talking about these incidences on a panel discussion on TV said that the message is to threaten the very ideas of free thought and humanity and its terror attacks (Indian flag hoisting in this case) can not be tolerated in any civilized liberal society.

Dr. Sen further added, “Ethical hypocrisy is not an intellectual construct the ideologically minded understand and tolerate well, but honest duplicity is the essence of modern liberalism and we must protect it at any cost.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-switches-stance-says-allow-subsidized-food-in-canteen-or-we-wont-let-parliament-work-8205,"New Delhi: Rahul Gandhi’s claim of reducing PM’s 56 inch chest into 5.6 inch turned out to be a dud when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj refused to bow down to pressure. As she threatened to expose a Congress leader for seeking diplomatic passport for a coal scam accused, an embarrassed Congress quickly postponed the much publicized ‘Silent Protest’ and went back to the drawing board.

Deserted by its UPA-I and UPA-II allies on parliament disruption issue, Congress is looking for a solid cause that can unite the secular parties inside the lower house. They have finally found a topic that touches cords with all its allies – Subsidized food in parliament canteen. Congress VP Rahul Gandhi has asserted that they will not let the parliament function unless PM promises that subsidy on canteen food will continue.

An angry Rahul tearing away current menu of parliament canteen.

Last week after huge uproar in social platforms and some online petitions, BJD MP Jay Panda wrote a letter requesting LS speaker to renounce the subsidy on food items. Initially everyone thought that this is another ‘brownie-point’ gathering exercise by Mr. Panda and soon people will forget about it. But as monsoon session drew near, they realized that shit has got real and something needs to be done.

Rahul Gandhi got twinkle in his eyes and dimple in his cheeks as he wasted no time in calling a press conference.

“Hume to pehle hi pata tha ki ye aadmi na khayega aur na khane dega. Aur bhaiya jaha tak khane ki baat hai, 67 saal me Congress ne kabhi bhi kisi ko nahi roka,” said Rahul Gandhi in a stern voice. While his party men started cheering, he was just unstoppable and went on offensive. He mocked PM for being silent.

“It is better for me and my party that Narendra Modi is silent,” Rahul Gandhi roared. “Err…Rahul Baba, other way round is also true. It’s better for Congress when you remain silent. You spoke in 2014 and we saw what happened,” said Shashi Tharoor who has still not finished responding to each individual praises he got on twitter for his excellent speech in Oxford reunion.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-scraps-monsoon-budget-and-winter-sessions-introduces-smoking-washroom-and-canteen-sessions-to-have-meaningful-parliamentary-discussion-8200,"New Delhi: In a move that could dramatically increase the productivity of the Parliament, BJP government is planning to scrap Monsoon, Budget and Winter sessions and planning to introduce Smoking, Washroom and Canteen sessions to have meaningful parliamentary discussion.

More meaningful sessions guaranteed.

Speaking to Faking News a source close to this development said, “The last few days have seen a lot of disruptions. The ruling government is concerned about the lack of meaningful discussions taking place in the Parliament. It has been observed that after Parliament is adjourned, members walk to the canteen, washroom and smoking area. It has also been noted that the level of discussion between the members is very meaningful unlike the ones in the Parliament.”

“There is a general sense of camaraderie among members when they are in these areas even if they belong to opposing parties. This has prompted the government to introduce new sessions in a bid to ensure productive work,” he added.

Many MPs welcomed this move saying that finally the government has come up with a good proposal. “I have been an MP for the last 10 years and have witnessed some really engaging discussions in the washroom. Infact PM’s ‘shauchalay yojana’ originated in the Parliament’s washroom,” said one MP.

Meanwhile, other MP’s have criticized the move saying this is another tactic by the ruling party to divide the people of this country like PM Modi is doing by selectively praising Shashi Tharoor.

Government is however very optimistic that this move will pay off. “It will not only make MPs happy but even Robert Vadra will not accuse us of using diversionary tactics during these sessions,” said one BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/canteen-smoking-washroom-300x122.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-scraps-monsoon-budget-and-winter-sessions-introduces-smoking-washroom-and-canteen-sessions-to-have-meaningful-parliamentary-discussion-8200,"Govt. scraps Monsoon, Budget and Winter sessions, introduces Smoking, Washroom and Canteen sessions to have meaningful parliamentary discussion",,1437721272.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-shift-parliament-to-mumbai-to-blame-citys-rains-for-disruption-of-monsoon-session-8198,"New Delhi: Concerned about rising criticism due to disruption of Parliament, government has come up with a unique solution to address the issue. Government plans to shift the Parliament’s monsoon session to Mumbai hoping to blame the city’s monsoon for lack of productive work.

Now MPs need not put so much effort to disrupt the Parliament. An easier way would be to blame it on Mumbai rains.

Speaking to Faking News a Member of Parliament said, “In the last couple of days, the Parliament has seen a lot of disruptions and more often the sessions have been adjourned. People are asking questions about the productivity of the Parliament. We thought it was time we needed a solution to justify this problem. So we came up with the plan of shifting the monsoon session to Mumbai.”

“It is a well known fact that during monsoon the normal pace of the city is disrupted. There are traffic jams, water logging, and transport services come to a standstill. We hope that the monsoon in the city can cover up for our lack of productivity too. I am waiting for the day when I can fearlessly address the media and say that the parliament was disrupted because of Mumbai’s monsoon,” he added.

Some MPs are not leaving anything to chance. They have submitted a proposal that the Parliament be located in Virar while they themselves stay at Colaba so that they can justify not attending work by blaming it on the long distance and traffic jams.

Meanwhile, a few MPs were excited at the prospect of monsoon session being shifted to Mumbai and were seen packing their bags already, hoping to do some sightseeing in their free time.

“We are concerned with disruption of session. We don’t care if it happens in Mumbai or Delhi. The good thing is that now we have an excuse. If the media wants to question, they can ask the rain gods,” said a visibly happy MP as he was busy checking out places to visit in Mumbai on his smartphone.

Experts say that the problem is with the naming of the session and shifting Parliament to Mumbai will not solve the problem. Budget and Winter Session’s will have similar problems as budget is understood by few people and in winter session most MPs will be in holiday mode.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bjp-mps-protest-disruption-of-parliament-by-congress-members-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-shift-parliament-to-mumbai-to-blame-citys-rains-for-disruption-of-monsoon-session-8198,"Govt to shift Parliament to Mumbai, to blame city’s rains for disruption of Monsoon Session",,1437643035.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/asteroid-on-collision-path-with-earth-takes-u-turn-after-it-is-severely-criticized-by-tv-expert-8194,"Gravity Space Station: An asteroid carrying 3.5 trillion dollar worth of precious metals which was originally headed for earth has changed its direction soon after veteran Indian politician Money Shanker Iyer was found criticizing the asteroid on national television. The asteroid has turned 180 degrees and is now seen moving away from earth. It is expected to collide with Jupiter now.

Collision averted thanks to Money Shankar Iyer

“This asteroid is nothing but a dog, a maniac and a maniac lame dog. It’s a snake whose head needs to be smashed. It’s a Persian messenger that needs to be kicked in the pit of death. I criticize it in most heinous words possible,” Iyer fumed in anger during an interview which was telecast across major news channels in India.

Soon after this interview Bhutan Indigenous Space and Technology Research Organization (BISTRO) released latest space captures of the asteroid, and a sharp turn in its path is clearly visible.

Daneesh Bagheria, chief research scientist at BISTRO explained these observations to media and said, “The talk show where Mr. Iyer took the case of poor asteroid was aired all across India at around 09:30 PM IST and the asteroid took a sharp turn at around 09:33 PM IST. These events which appear unrelated may actually be closely related.”

While Mr. Iyer has been known to severely criticize politicians, actors and other normal individuals across the country, this was the first time he criticized a heavenly body, such as an asteroid.

The repercussions of this U-turn by the asteroid were seen all across the globe. Research scientists at NASA who had been working on an anti-asteroid missile for months saw their whole effort go down the drain.

Cohen Johner, a senior astro-physicist at NASA expressed his dejection to media in following words, “It’s not only about millions of dollars we lost because the asteroid which we were trying to deflect changed its path on its own. It’s about lost dreams. The current ilk of young scientists at NASA are all kids of a generation which grew up watching Hollywood movies where NASA scientists created rockets that deflected asteroid and saved earth. That was the heroic victory we were aiming for. But some Indian politician just wakes up one day and beats the shit outta asteroid and the heavenly body just simply runs away? Our dreams of a heroic endeavor are crushed.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/asteroid.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/asteroid-on-collision-path-with-earth-takes-u-turn-after-it-is-severely-criticized-by-tv-expert-8194,Asteroid on collision path with earth takes U-turn after it is severely criticized by TV expert,,1437552439.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A Hindutvavadi was threatening to remove eyes of Shahrukh, when SRK said he can’t be controlled

Speaking to Faking News, Archana Singh said, “Today, I read an online review that Salman Khan was forced to play the role of Sanghi in his film, so that it can pass the Censor Board. It is widely known that Censor Board was hijacked by Sanghis who wanted to spread the ideology of RSS across the nation.

They want every other Indian to be a walking and talking Sanghi. Poor Salman Khan had to bend down and crawl to push his film for an Eid release. And by acting as a Hindutvavadi, Salman is made to lose his Muslim fan base, which was already usurped by Owaisi last year. This is indeed the start of Emergency as envisioned by our intellectuals.”

She continued, “You might wonder whether this is something specific to Modi. It can be, owing to the fact that, we are currently living in a fascist rule, where nobody can criticise this government and logoff Twitter peacefully. Coming back to the topic, this is not something new. During NDA rule under Vajpayee, RSS was indeed holding Bollywood film industry under its grip. They forced a Muslim, Shahrukh Khan, to produce and act in a movie called Asoka that has no Muslims appearing in the entire film.”

“Back then as a teenager, I was whistling and gushing at the charm of SRK. But, I got a chance to watch Asoka film few weeks back and I could now see a lot of Hindutva restrictions that were forced into that movie. The major point, as I said, there was not even a single Muslim in that film. Also, there were no Christians, and Sikhs. There is no depiction of minorities in a Bollywood movie that is supposed to cater to audience across all religions. Also, the movie ends with the protagonist embracing Buddhism. We should connect the dots here. Hope you remember the Rakhine riots in Burma, where Rohingya muslims were massacred. It has the involvement of Buddhist extremists. As birds of same feather flock together, a movie shows only Hindus and Buddhists; and a minority hero is forced to produce and act in the movie,” shrugged Archana with a bitter expression.

Before ending the interview, she said, “It is high time intellectuals, seculars and liberals of India unite and send a strong message to other secular nations of world and United Nations that artistic expression of India is in danger due to the rising Hindutva sphere of influence in almost all areas.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/18-300x128.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/similar-to-salmans-bajrangi-bhaijaan-even-srk-was-forced-to-make-asoka-with-no-muslims-appearing-in-that-film-to-appease-bhakts-film-expert-8186,"Similar to Salman's Bajrangi Bhaijaan, even SRK was forced to make Asoka with no Muslims appearing in that film, to appease Bhakts - Film Expert",,1437282554.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Bajrangi Bhaijaan Narendra Modi carrying an infiltrator safely back home to Pakistan

Speaking to the audience at Jammu University he said, “India has always faced the problem of infiltration from across the border. It is common knowledge that infiltrators have support of the Pak government. But whenever we confront the Pak government on this issue, they say infiltrators are non-state actors. Even infiltrators who are caught by the army play victims and say that they have lost their way. So I will personally ensure that each and every infiltrator is safely sent back to Pakistan.”

PM has called it ‘Ghar Wapasi Abhiyan’ and has asked the people of JnK to join him in helping all the poor infiltrators find their way back home.

Many infiltrators are happy with the PM’s assurance and hope they will get to see their family soon.

“I was picked up by Pakistani officials and asked to go against my will across the border. Now there is hope for us. We can look forward to Acche Din,” said a visibly happy infiltrator.

Meanwhile, Congress has called it another sham to divert attention of the people. Senior party leader Digvijay Singh questioned the PM’s intentions.

Knowing that politicians across the party lines take pride in showcasing their secular credentials PMO has decided to hold upcoming important meetings in between Iftar parties.

Iftar party or NITI Ayog meeting or both ?

PM Modi who is never keen on hosting or attending Iftar has agreed to it with heavy heart.

Since no secular politician wants to be seen missing from Iftar parties, we can expect a full house. Between the tasty bites of Haleem and Biryani, PM hopes to strike consensus on Land Aquisition Bill.

However skeptics are still not very positive about the idea of having Iftar with Modi. “What is he up to? I am sure he will take Selfie with all of us and upload it on twitter,” said one such skeptic.

He added, “If we are seen standing with Modi, the very purpose of attending Iftar will be defeated. Our secular credentials will be ruined forever.”

While all this was still getting finalized, NDTV tweeted that Iftar with PM will have a 30 minute mandatory Yoga session too. When confronted by Social Media Bhakts, they clarified that source of this news was an anonymous caller.

A representative from the channel said, “Since the news looked good enough to troll the government we didn’t bother to verify the sources and published it straightaway. Don’t worry, if it is not true, alert twitter users will automatically point out. We don’t have to waste our time in verifying the news.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Iftar-niti.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-to-hold-niti-ayog-meetings-during-iftar-party-to-ensure-participation-from-all-cms-8173,PM to hold Niti Ayog meetings during Iftar party to ensure participation from all CMs,,1437030635.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-phone-stops-working-reason-might-be-due-to-too-many-times-toggle-between-airplane-mode-on-and-off-8162,"New Delhi: According to our sources in PMO, the smart phone used by PM Narendra Modi which he purchased a year ago, has stopped working. It seems this happened when he was on his way to Russia from Kazakhstan to attend BRICS summit.

PM Modi needs a custom made smartphone

Faking News made an attempt to speak to PMO through its spokesperson to know more about this. However, most of our emails, calls, WhatsApp messages went unanswered. When Faking news was contemplating to file an RTI, we got one message through sms that read, “The phone which media is speculating is not working, is PM’s personal phone which is outside RTI’s ambit and official phone is with PM’s principal secretary most of the time.”

All the calls Faking News made towards official number went unanswered. It seemed that was phone was also switched off or with airplane mode settings as off.

Looking at the records, in last one year PM has visited close to 20 countries belonging to different continents. As per the norm most of the airlines request you to keep your mobile phone switched off or at least set the airplane mode settings as off when flight is taking off and landing. It is strictly enforced for the flights where PM is on board. In those flights one needs to keep phone with airplane mode settings as off for the entire duration of the flight due to security reasons.

Faking News met one of the experts on smartphone technology, Mr. Ragesh N. We started by asking, “Is there a link between changing airplane mode settings too many times and phone going bad because of this?”

Mr. Ragesh told us this might be the case, but it is very difficult to correlate unless he has all the details with him. Mr. Ragesh highlighted, “You need to remember PM is travelling to so many countries in short span of time. As he brings his phone back to network through airplane mode settings, he is bound to use network carriers of different countries as he is roaming. We cannot rule out, there might be a correlation between too much roaming and phone going bad. We need a thorough analysis. I have asked my testing department to help me on this. The challenge before us is, we cannot travel to so many countries to simulate this problem.”

Mr. Ragesh also pointed out in addition he is also doing research why the smart phones run out of battery while crossing five signals in Bangalore.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/namo-smartphone.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-phone-stops-working-reason-might-be-due-to-too-many-times-toggle-between-airplane-mode-on-and-off-8162,"PM’s phone stops working, reason might be due to too many times toggle between airplane mode on and off",,1436676692.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The ban has been heavily advertised by the government in all the mainstream media including the daily newspapers. This morning’s headline in the state, almost everywhere, reads ‘MP bans whistles!’ A Faking News reporter mustered enough courage to directly talk to a government official on the ban.

FN: Good morning. As a new rule from press, we would like to frisk you for any untoward substance that you might inadvertently carry. Do we have your permission on that?

GO: Oh! No. Go right ahead. We are a transparent government. Got nothing to hide! On the other hand, we have to search you and your team if you are carrying any whistles. Search em boys! The GO gestured towards the team and after mutual frisking, the dialogue continued.

Not a safe thing to do

FN: A government banning whistles! Seems very unusual and eccentric even for a state like MP. GO: What’s unusual about it? The sounds from those whistles are annoying, you know. We have done extensive lab testing on both the whistles and the decibel level tolerance of a common man. Also on a politician, to test on a different breed and the results were shocking. Most of them could not stand the whistle sound and some of them reported to have immediate brain damage that stimulates violent behavior to attack the apparatus that makes the sound and anyone who is holding it.

FN: Wow! GO: Precisely the same expression we all had too! That’s when we decided to announce the ban on whistles, effective immediately. Whistle blowing in MP is not a child’s play anymore. It is henceforth statutorily deemed as a deadly sport. The government bans the activity and anybody found blowing a whistle will be arrested, if it is not too late; i.e. if the law of the land can beat the act of god.

FN: What you plan to do with all the whistles that are already in the shops in the state? GO: Like that 2 minutes noodles, the whistles will be recalled and destroyed. The government has hired a cement company to destroy the whistles for a paltry sum of Rs. 250 crores. Our strong and concrete relationship will certainly demolish those whistles into pieces.

At the end of the interview, the GO hummed a Hindi song in a visibly happy mood, and Faking News reporter just walked away, careful enough not to whistle along – clearly aware that not just whistling, even saying a word in MP can prove to be fatal.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whistleblower-300x152.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mp-government-bans-whistles-in-the-state-8159,MP government bans whistles in the state,,1436593258.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Pakistani PM was left red faced when newspapers back home reported how Indo-Pak ceasefire documents were recovered from a kabadiwala in Karachi.

Looking for Indo-Pak ceasefire document? Here it is

The request for ceasefire documents was conveyed by Pakistani Embassy in India after firing from Pakistan side was reported along the border. The Pakistan High Commissioner to India Mr. Abdul Basit asked for the documents after he was summoned by India government and asked to explain Pakistan’s position on the violation.

After the request was sent, officials in Pakistan started hunting for the documents which apparently were misplaced and landed up with a kabadiwala. Speaking to FN a government official on the condition of anonymity tried to explain how the vital documents ended up in scrap. He said, “Our government offices are full of junk files. There is no space for anymore files. Tell me, if govt. offices are used for keeping files, where do we keep our guns. So our government took a decision to sell all files in scrap so that we have space to keep our ammunition.”

Pakistani officials have promised their Indian counterpart that the matter will be taken up seriously like all other previous bilateral matters provided they receive ‘credible evidence’ from India. They have also promised action against erring government officials who are responsible for the negligence.

Meanwhile, Indian Army has said that it is relieved that the documents have been found and at least now the Pakistani army will know that there is something called ‘ceasefire’ that exists between the two nations.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kabadiwala.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/major-embarrassment-for-nawaz-sharif-as-indo-pak-ceasefire-documents-recovered-from-a-kabadiwala-in-karachi-8154,Major embarrassment for Nawaz Sharif as Indo-Pak ceasefire documents recovered from a kabadiwala in Karachi,,1436511420.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After allocating a whooping 526 crores for information and publicity in current financial year, AAP has now decided to hire Aamir Khan as party’s brand ambassador and marketing strategist.

Party now claims that such high amount was set aside only because half of it was to pay fees of Aamir Khan.

“Mainu o munda chaihda haiga”

“Our publicity seeking tactics have now become old. Voters are able to see through such gimmicks. We need innovation in the way we advertize our self. That is why we have decided to rope in the perfectionist Aamir Khan, who is widely regarded as the marketing genius in Bollywood,” Manish Sisodia told Faking News, “Also he agreed to work on subsidized fees for us.”

“Being an honest man and a highly secular person, Kejriwal ji enjoyed movie PK to the fullest and was amazed at how effortlessly Aamir was able to pull off publicity for the film, keeping it different from all his previous films,” Ashutosh told Faking News, when asked how was Aamir’s name finalized.

AAP is now confident that all the flak that it is facing for spending so much on itself will subside once Aamir is on board.

“Aamir has enough goodwill among the masses in India. Therefore anything that he preaches or imparts is grabbed by them without questioning his hypocrisy. This is something we have been lacking of late,” admitted Ashish Khetan.

If sources are to be believed, AAP wants Aamir to publicize party in the same fashion as he anchors his show Satyameva Jayate.

“Wouldn’t it be nice and sensational, if Aamir were to present work done by us not done by BJP ruled MCD in Delhi by saying stuff like ‘Aayie dikhaate hain aap logo kuch chaukan dene wale gandgi aur bhrashtachaar ke aankde’ or ‘Chaliye baat karte hain us bikhaari se jisne 5 rupay de kar Kejriwal ji ki aankhon mein aansoo bhar diye’,” Ashutosh asked our reporter.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kejri-aamir_650_021015064338-300x192.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-govt-to-hire-aamir-khan-for-publicity-half-of-526-cr-to-be-paid-as-professional-fees-8146,"AAP govt to hire Aamir Khan for publicity, half of 526 cr to be paid as professional fees",,1436342967.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Displaying a true sportsman spirit, Jung decided to keep equations with Arvind Kejriwal aside and wrote a thank you letter to him.

Jung claims that his gratitude was based on the small survey his aides carried out to find awareness about governors among common men.

“Tell me, prior to me, how many governors’ names or faces have you known?” Jung asked our reporter, “I mean my own kids didn’t know that I was governor of Delhi till Sheila ji was CM.”

Jung thanking Kejriwal

“A governor’s job in India has been relegated to just featuring in GK books and making preparations of UPSC aspirants difficult. That’s it!” he added.

“And here these guys have given me so much publicity that yesterday Shahrukh Khan called me up and expressed his wish to be Delhi governor for few months before his next film release,” he continued.

“I am glad and indebted to Kejriwal & Co for making me famous and a known figure among masses,” he concluded.

However Jung argued that it wasn’t all that easy for him after all.

“I didn’t get it all on platter. I had to struggle for it. Take baseless allegations and accusations leveled against me, in my stride. Comfort myself in being allegedly a BJP and Congress agent. Work for almost a year when there was no govt. It was tough,” he said wiping off sweat from his face.

Meanwhile many old aged politicians and other prominent people who were eyeing posts of governors have now decided to change their mind.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/before-meeting-with-kejriwal-pranab-mukherjee-rechecks-if-his-own-appointment-is-valid-7964,"New Delhi: As Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal asserted his position on the issue of appointment of Chief Secretary and requested a meeting with Mr. President, Rashtrapati Bhavan witnessed some uneasy moments last night. Although Pranab Mukherjee had already consulted Solicitor General on the issue and was assured that he can back LG Najeeb Jung, Prez was worried what if Delhi CM gets pissed off and starts raising questions on President’s appointment itself.

Shaitaan Khopdi™, Faking News reporter, luckily got once in a lifetime opportunity to have an audience with Honorable President and didn’t miss the chance to discuss the matter with him.

Kejriwal asking proof of Pranab’s appointment.

Shaitaan Khopdi™: Pranab da, I heard that you were feeling uneasy last night. All well? These are not the good times ‘Piku-liarly’ for Bangalis living in Delhi eh?

Pranab Mukherjee: Nothing much, was checking the voting results of my Presidential election in 2012. Just to be sure you know.

Shaitaan Khopdi™: But that was 3 year back. You are already half way through!!!

Pranab Mukherjee: The way Kejriwal is quoting rules and laws over the appointment of Chief Secretary, I was worried what if he challenges my appointment itself. I just wanted to be sure that nothing is wrong with my position before giving Gyan to him on constitutional matters.

Shaitaan Khopdi™: But you won fair and square. How can somebody dispute it?

Pranab Mukherjee: You never know. They even raised doubts over PM Modi’s win in Varanasi, attributing it to 3.5 Lakh fake votes.

Shaitaan Khopdi™: At least on legal matters you should have an upper hand especially when the Chief Justice of India himself reports to you.

Pranab Mukherjee: Not anymore. Actually it’s all my mistake yaar!!! Last time when he came over, I gifted him a copy of Indian Constitution. Like a true engineer he mugged up every line of it during his 9 days of Naturopathy in Bangalore. By now he knows constitution of India by heart. That’s why he kicked out Prashant Bhushan soon after coming from Bangalore.

As the president had a busy day ahead, Shaitaan Khopdi™ finished the interview and wished him good luck for the meeting with CM Kejriwal.

Before getting elected with bumper majority in Delhi, AAP had promised to teach a new type of politics to the older parties. Promises of free Wi-Fi and CCTV may take time but going by the proceedings in Delhi in last few days it is clear that AAP have been able to fulfill this promise at least.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BL12_STATES_KEJRIW_2307294e-212x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/before-meeting-with-kejriwal-pranab-mukherjee-rechecks-if-his-own-appointment-is-valid-7964,"Before meeting with Kejriwal, Pranab Mukherjee rechecks if his own appointment is valid",,1432030399.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lt-governor-seen-eating-chhole-bhature-at-roadside-stall-aap-alleges-connections-with-food-industry-7960,"New Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party has put forth a strong proof of nexus between Lieutenant Governor (LG) Najeeb Jung and the food industry after it published photographs of Jung having Rajma-Chawal and Chhole Bhature at a roadside stall at a local market. While it is not yet clear so as to which companies does AAP actually categorizes as Food industry, but high definition photographs of Mr. Jung devouring various delicious food items are now published on the AAP website as a proof.

AAP supremo Arvind Kejrwal has even written a tough worded letter to LG and has strictly “requested“ him to behave within confines of the constitution. He has advised LG not to indulge in activities such as devouring delicious road-side food which strongly indicate his attachment to food processing and catering industry.

Najeeb Jung caught by Kejriwal while leaving the roadside stall.

While AAP is now planning a dharna, a candle light march and a banner protest, all three back to back against this alleged nexus, they are getting stiff opposition from an unexpected group. An online fan community by name “Worshippers of Rajma Chaawal (WORCHA)” has registered a strong protest against politicizing something as innocent and neutral as Rajma Chaawal.

Executive Vice Chancellor for WORCHA Mrs. Rajmeeta Chaawla warned AAP volunteers of any nuisance in the name of Rajma Chaawal or there would be dire consequences.

Rajmeeta wrote the following on her food blog, “Galat pangaa le liya hai AAP ne. As die-hard fans of Rajma Chaawal we here by warn AAP volunteers to not drag this innocent dish in any of their political tussles. Rajma Chaawal definitely has more fans and worshippers in any small locality of Delhi than AAP has salaried volunteers in whole Delhi-National Capital Region.”

After this ruckus over Rajma Chaawal started gaining momentum among Delhi population, senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia quickly launched an internal survey to decide if photographs of Najeeb Jung devouring these dishes should be taken down from the AAP website or not. After the results of survey were out it was decided that the photographs of LG eating Rajma Chaawal would be taken down but the ones that show him eating Chhole Bhature would be retained.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/njdip-292x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lt-governor-seen-eating-chhole-bhature-at-roadside-stall-aap-alleges-connections-with-food-industry-7960,"Lt Governor seen eating Chhole Bhature at roadside stall, AAP alleges connections with food industry",,1431940112.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/true-aap-member-spends-the-night-at-the-signal-as-traffic-light-malfunction-remained-red-throughout-7946,"New Delhi. Mainstream media which was busy in covering Salman Khan case missed to report something unique which happened last weekend. An honest AAP member Gaya Singh who has taken vow not to break any of the party’s principles come whatsoever may, was struck at a traffic signal as the light malfunctioned and remained red all through the night.

Faking news reporter Ashutosh was the first to trace him. Gaya Singh narrated the incident as unfolded, “After attending AAP national council meeting I was on my way to my hometown. My party which believed in transparency checked the petrol bill to find amount of fuel we have used to reach Delhi from our respective hometowns. Exactly same amount of petrol was loaded to every vehicle. Everything was ok, I was hopeful of reaching home well before midnight. Unfortunately on national highway one traffic signal light malfunctioned and remained in red”.

Sketch drawn by Gaya Singh of the red light.

“After two to three minutes people started moving and did not care about the traffic light. Unfortunately I could not do that as I have taken oath in my party office to obey all traffic rules and never ever jump any signal. I could see no one was respecting the signal and all were happily jumping it.”

“Initially I thought I may have color blindness problem. I stopped one bike rider to double check the color, he scolded me for blocking his way and then he told yes, it’s red, so what? There was no place nearby to take rest or any traffic police to consult. Luckily for me this was night time, otherwise I would have evaporated in the sun.”

Our reporter was anxious to know after all how did he cross the signal. Gaya Singh told us, “Luckily one police patrolling team saw me before sunrise. They checked everything I had and were about to go when I asked for their help. One of them was kind enough in switching off the signal light by calling someone using his walkie talkie.”

Gaya Singh wanted to file an RTI to know when was the last time these lights were tested, checked & serviced. Party high command persuaded him not to do that as they are the ruling party in Delhi and unlike Delhi Police department, the traffic light department comes under it’s purview. This will be another embarrassment for the party. Last we heard party has apologized to Gaya Singh for the inconvenience he faced and rewarded him for respecting the party’s principle.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RED-233x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/true-aap-member-spends-the-night-at-the-signal-as-traffic-light-malfunction-remained-red-throughout-7946,True AAP member spends night at signal as traffic light malfunctions & remains red throughout,,1431595658.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tmc-govt-in-bengal-develops-a-memory-loss-pill-to-delete-memories-of-nadia-riots-from-minds-of-locals-7941,"Kolkata. After having successfully buried any mainstream discussion on the ongoing Nadia riots, TMC govt in West Bengal has now developed a pill which when consumed can delete whatever memories locals have of the riots.

Claiming that pill was invented to maintain communal harmony in the state, a top TMC leader said, “Though we and our friends in Media tried our best to ensure that news about Nadia riots doesn’t go widespread, but still through few communal journalists and social media, the news has reached ears of some of the locals. To ensure such incidents don’t spoil the mood of the state and to curb the negativity associated with it, our honorable CM Mamata didi thought of this brilliant idea to make a pill.”

The pill named Seclurocetamol will be given free of cost to the Bengal population in a Pulse Polio type statewide campaign.

Mamata Banerjee wondering if she needs to do anything else to maintain secular fabric of Bengal.

“We care for them. We feel their pain. Hence want them to forget those horrifying days and get over with it,” Derek O’Brien said, as he popped a pill into the mouth of a Hindu youth who lost his family member in the riots.

“See riots are there to stay. So we have to ensure such things don’t start bothering,” he said when asked if instead of inventing such pills, shouldn’t govt be stopping such riots, which have become a regular feature in the state.

“Ideally people should have become used to it and have taken it in their stride and moved ahead. Unfortunately they haven’t, so we have to spend money on making such memory loss pills,” he argued.

Latest reports however suggest that pill has a massive side effect.

“Although I forgot most of the stuff and atrocities committed on me and my community during Nadia riots, but the pill seemed to have further enhanced my memory of Gujarat riots, which I had no relation with,” revealed Gautam Ghosh, a resident of Nadia.

Meanwhile Samajwadi Party govt in UP has also requested TMC to share with them the recipe of this pill so that Shamli incident can be wiped out from memories of UP locals.

Opposition leaders of BJP in Bengal too have decided to manufacture such pills which thy will give to their supporters, who are upset with the party for not cornering TMC at all, on these riots in parliament.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Would_be_happy_4192-300x210.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tmc-govt-in-bengal-develops-a-memory-loss-pill-to-delete-memories-of-nadia-riots-from-minds-of-locals-7941,TMC govt in Bengal develops a memory loss pill to delete memories of Nadia riots from minds of locals,,1431508099.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-asks-pollard-to-put-the-same-tape-he-war-wearing-on-sakshi-maharajs-mouth-7884,"New Delhi. Fed up of the stupid statements issued by Sakshi Maharaj every now and then, senior leadership from BJP has approached MI player Keiron Pollard, requesting him to put the same tape he was wearing on his mouth a few days back, on Sakshi’s mouth.

The decision was taken after latest statement of Sakshi Maharaj where he claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s Kedarnath visit caused Nepal earthquake.

“Since he does not appear to be sensible enough like Kiran Bedi, to shut himself, we have sought help from Pollard Ji to do the needful,” confirmed BJP president Amit Shah.

“The tape seemed to have worked in his case as we hardly saw him get verbally involved in anything on field,” Shah pointed.

BJP’s last option.

When told they could still defend Sakshi’s statements through their spokesperson Sambit Patra, Shah argued, “No, that’s even riskier. We fear in his bid to defend such statements from Sakshi, he will mouth a statement even more stupid than original and then we will have to send someone to defend that statement.”

Some of the other measures taken by BJP to tackle menace of Sakshi Maharaj include uninstallation of whatsapp from his mobile, confiscation of Nirmal Baba CDs and keeping a tab on his meetings with some SP leaders like Abu Azmi, Azam Khan etc.

BJP has also approached AAP leader Ashutosh to teach their spokespersons the art of shedding crocodile tears on TV, as that seems to be their last resort to defend Sakshi.

“We are sure a certain Sambit Patra crying on TV, saying ‘ispe gandi rajneeti mat kariye Sonia ji’ will definitely have an impact and touch the right chords,” claimed Amit Shah.

Meanwhile many opposition parties and media personnel, who were earlier after BJP to take action against the likes of Sakshi Maharaj, were now seen lamenting how Modi led BJP was curtailing free speech of a fellow MP.

“By putting Tape on a respected leader’s mouth, dictator Modi is trying to muzzle voices of dissent. This is shameful,” said Digvijay Singh. “My career would have been over if Congress had leadership like BJP.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed-2.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-asks-pollard-to-put-the-same-tape-he-war-wearing-on-sakshi-maharajs-mouth-7884,BJP asks Pollard to put the same tape he was wearing on Sakshi Maharaj's mouth,,1430207863.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/count-dracula-floats-ngo-for-vampire-rights-wants-minority-status-blood-sucking-legalized-7883,"New Delhi: Count Vlad Tepes “the impaler” from Transylvania, properly addressed as Count Dracula, was in city to inaugurate an exhibition on ancient European arts. He had also organized a high-tea and met up with several human rights activists to understand human concerns about vampires.

He assured them continued co-operation from himself and his breed. Later he also addressed a small press conference after the exhibition and high-tea were over.

After sitting quietly at the press conference for a few minutes he finally began in a deep, calm voice, “Welcome everyone to this conference. I apologize if I sound a bit weary. I am actually a bit worn out due to my flight after which I came straight from airport to here. I have just hacked .. apologies .. I meant I have just sacked my personal secretary for this bad itinerary planning. Onboard the flight I did watch some vampire-movies after a long time, as it was a long flight from Frankfurt to New Delhi. The vampire movies these days are just gross, no elegance of old times.”

A generous Count Dracula

“Anyhow I will talk about a couple of important points to you gentlemen. A) vampire rights, B) vampire privileges. Vampire rights and privileges are very crucial these days as our-kind is severely depleted due to a lot of natural and man-made hunters. (Count Dracula also showed a power-point presentation with a data-chart depicting their depleting numbers over the years)”

“So as a minority community we seek protection, harmony and love from our human brothers. As a gesture of love, most of us have stopped biting humans and sucking their blood and have resorted to drinking chemically prepared blood substitutes. This dietary change is affecting our health in a bad way, but that is a sacrifice we are willing to make. In return all we ask is that every vampire be given blood sucking opportunity, once in every few days, say every 3 days. We can negotiate on this number and reach a final number through mutual cooperation but this is an activity which will help us survive as a species,” Count Dracula said.

When asked about his new NGO, count Dracula gave a short-lived smile-like expression and said, “Yes, that is a new non-government organization which I have just registered in Romania to fight for vampire rights. We have also bought some real-estate adjacent to beautiful Danube river and our new plush office is under construction. Having a local branch-office here in India is also on cards, but we are still working on legal paper-work around that. This NGO is also in need for funds and volunteers so you all are welcome to contribute.”

In the middle of the press conference Count Dracula suddenly started coughing loudly and got into a fit of coughs, as smell of garlic tea which was being served at the press conference spread in the whole room. Extremely allergic to garlic he was quickly escorted out of the room into the gallery where he suffered serious burns owing to sudden exposure to sun-light. He was immediately rushed to AIIMS where after a few hours of solitary confinement and self-healing he was declared completely fit by doctors.

While Count Dracula has rejected all offers of News channel panel discussions, he is expected to be holding another high-tea event early next week where he would be meeting several dynasty princes and discuss his views on purity of blood and its impact on policy making.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/count-dracula-floats-ngo-for-vampire-rights-wants-minority-status-blood-sucking-legalized-7883,"Count Dracula floats NGO for vampire-rights; wants minority status, blood sucking legalized",,1430128450.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Ever since reports of N Srinivsan spying on fellow BCCI members came in public domain, there has been growing demand among AAP supporters to make him president of the party.

Linking it with how current party chief Arvind Kejriwal ordered illegal recording of discarded leader Yogendra Yadav’s telephonic conversation with a reporter, AAP supporters claim that Delhi CM be freed of such responsibilities now and be allowed to concentrate on dharnas, blaming Delhi Police/Modi , governance etc.

Kejriwal worshiping Srinivsasn after making him his idol

“In Srinivasan, we see an able contender for the position of AAP supremo. I am sure once on board, he will bring with him fresh autocratic ideas to the table which will help take the movement forward,” said an AAP volunteer, who was extremely disappointed with the naivety AAP handled the entire Gajendra suicide fiasco.

He is confident that Srinivasan would not come out as a novice while orchestrating such political stunts.

“The fact that it is so many days after him spying that he has been caught proves how professionally he goes about these things,” he added.

Senior leaders of AAP too have taken notice of this demand and agree that compared to Kejriwal, Srinivsans is a better prospect at present.

“He carries with him a vast dictatorial experience, which could be a clincher for him,” a member of AAP’s National Executive Committee told Faking News on conditions of anonymity.

“Also the way he trolled Arnab Goswami throughout the IPL spot fixing scandal episode has also impressed other members of committee,” he went on to add.

“Not just this, he continued to control happenings in BCCI even after stepping down and being at Dubai, which reminded us of how Kejriwal continued to call shots while taking naturopathy treatment in Bangalore,” he further said.

Meanwhile Srinivasan has decided to accept the demand on condition that he be allowed to replace Manish Sisodia and Ashutosh with Sunil Gavaskar or Ravi Shastri.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kejriwal-Srinivasan-AFP-and-IANS-300x169.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/n-srinivasan-set-to-replace-kejriwal-as-aap-president-after-reports-of-him-spying-on-bcci-officials-7881,N Srinivasan set to replace Kejriwal as AAP president after reports of him spying on BCCI officials surface,,1430121741.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After batting for farmers and net neutrality in Parliament, Rahul has now decided to bat for Mumbai Indians, this time literally, to pull the franchise out of misery in ongoing season of IPL.

Rahul Gandhi took this decision after seeing MI fans getting disappointed having lost to arch rivals Delhi Daredevils yesterday.

Rahul will now fly to Mumbai and take matter bat in his own hands to bring about a change in the fortune of MI.

RaGa in action.

“BCCI has given IPL teams to corporates,” the MP from Amethi said, pointing to Mumbai Indians management. “Young cricket fans of this country are feeling cheated.”

“Yeh suit-boot wale coaching staff kuch nahi kar rahe hain,” Rahul said hitting out at the illustrious list of Mumbai Indian coaches, “But I appreciate sports minister of Mumbai Indians, Mr Navjot Sidhu for being honest enough to admit on TV that Mumbai ko coach toh kya bhagwan bhi nahi bacha sakta.”

Rahul’s move had all his loyalists going gaga over him.

“Everyone knows Mumbai is mini India, with people from all over India residing here. With this one move, Rahul ji has won hearts of entire India,” said Rajiv Shukla, who is overseeing all arrangements for Rahul to play for MI.

If sources are to be believed, his trip to Kedarnath is a part of stamina building exercise for the upcoming matches that he intends to bat for MI.

Though it is still not confirmed on which position will Gandhi scion bat for MI. But one thing is certain that he won’t take the number 1 position, therefore won’t open.

“I would like Rahul Baba to take up no 1 batting position. He should lead from front. But I guess like his great grandfather, he too loves kids and doesn’t want to deny Parthiv Patel an opportunity to open. This shows his strong belief in ‘Main nahi Hum’,” Digvijay Singh explained.

The MI management too sounded upbeat about helping hand offered by Rahul.

“We are happy to have him in our side. But we hope we don’t have to go around looking for him when his turn for batting comes. Hope he won’t leave stadium to fly off to some foreign location in the middle of the match,” MI owner Nita Ambani told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RAGA-262x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-batting-for-farmers-and-net-neutrality-rahul-gandhi-to-now-bat-for-mumbai-indians-literally-7872,"After batting for farmers and net neutrality, Rahul Gandhi to now bat for Mumbai Indians, literally",,1429862223.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Darling of liberal and normal news channels, and heir to the Congress throne, Rahul Gandhi, has shed light on some amazing facts regarding his recent 50+ days vacation. Talking to a press conference he explained his exciting journey in detail.

“I think that green leaf, which I found on the floor of a night club, was some kind of an empowering gadget, an inter-dimensional portal opener, a quintessential worm-hole device. As soon as I “smelled” that gadget, it empowered me to travel across galaxies to a new planet. That is why no one was able to locate me during my vacation days. And I knew you won’t believe a word of what I say about my journey to this alien world, hence I did not reveal these details until now but then I can’t keep anything from you beloved reporters, can I?” Rahul baba smiled and said.

Rahul describing the alien planet.

When asked for how long he was on that alien planet Rahul baba further added, “Was it for 50 days or was it for 56 days, if you ask me that specifically, I don’t remember. I just remember that I was very high in the sky for a few moments and then I was thrown on a planet which was totally green in color. Green cotton-candy, green ice-creams, all cartoon channels were also being shown in green color. And yes, there were green crops everywhere and there were poor farmers everywhere. Lot of poor, wretched farmers. They all were growing the same leaves which I had just smelled. All in all it was fun.”

On being asked what he did on a distant planet for so many days, Rahul baba gave a puzzled look and said, “My memory is pretty hazy on exact details but mostly I was doing some kind of charity work. Empowering women etc. I remember on that planet I was called upon for inauguration of ten to fifteen gymnasiums for women, which is really great as women can regularly go to gym and empower their bodies. Those aliens did treat their women well, we ought to learn from them. I wish I could go there again, and perhaps take you guys along with me as well.”

Before he could speak anything further, veteran congress leader Digvijay Singh quickly entered the room and whispered something in Rahul baba’s ear. Immediately after this Singh escorted baba out of the room and the press conference ended abruptly.

While it is not yet clear what scientists and doctors will make out of these revelations made by Rahul baba, the twitterati swung into action soon after this press conference, with thousands of twitter users hypothesizing about Rahul Baba’s journey.

Hashtags #GreenLeafNarnia and #RahulOnJetPlane immediately started trending in the South-east Asia region, and were top-trends for around 3 hour 42 minutes before they suddenly disappeared from the trends list on twitter.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/110-300x167.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-smelling-a-green-leaf-i-was-transported-to-an-alien-planet-where-i-spent-50-days-rahul-gandhi-7871,"After smelling a green-leaf I was transported to an alien planet, where I spent 50 days: Rahul Gandhi",,1429861521.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

What do you do when your state government issues a cheque as compensation and it bounces? Sounds bizarre? Its a very unique feat achieved by UP government and Akhilesh government should be given full credit for this achievement. BCCI was quick to recognize and also award Akhilesh government. BCCI has hired Akhilesh as cheif pitch curator. The reason behind this is that BCCI wants to create bouncy pitches in India.

Akhilesh Yadav laughing after Raina requested for a meeting following this news

UP government showed its good intentions by announcing compensation to farmers who are effected by untimely rains. The government followed up by issuing cheques worth 2o crores to farmers but when farmers tried to cash them, most of the cheques bounced and this has incurred fines worth 25 crores on the government.One organization with a keen sense for talent reacted swiftly to this incident and hired Akhilesh Yadav immediately.We talked to BCCI chief Daal-mein Kala-Miya about this.

Kekdekar : Sir, You could have hired Vijay Malya. He also has a strong resume.

Daal-mein Kala-Miya : Well, very valid question. Vijay Malyas cheque bounces only when his Airlines employees try to cash it and that number is very small. When you compare that to what Akhilesh has achieved, Vijay Malya does not stand a chance.

Kekdekar : What are the other qualities that impressed you ?

Daal-mein Kala-miya : His government issued cheques for amounts such as 73 rupees , 150 rupess, 750 rupees and so on. Even many of those cheques bounced. This is what has impressed me the most.

Kekdekar : So what is your plan ?

Daal-mein Kala-Miya : Many teams in the WorldCup( IPL ) have good fast bowlers. They are complaining that we don’t have bouncy wickets. With Akhilesh as chief curator, by next WorldCup (IPL -9 ) we will have a wicket that will have more bounce that Perth.

Wicket in India bouncier than Perth sounds a really great thing for Indian cricket. Hopefully, BCCI will also hire some farmers to grow grass on those bouncy pitches.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/u8_Akhilesh-yadav-CM-UP-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bcci-hires-akhilesh-yadav-to-prepare-bouncy-wickets-after-most-of-his-governments-farmer-compensation-cheques-bounce-7863,BCCI hires Akhilesh Yadav to prepare bouncy wickets after most of his governments farmer compensation cheques bounce,,1429683643.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/yogendra-yadav-and-prashant-bhushan-to-stand-outside-kejriwals-residence-night-day-to-win-back-his-heart-7862,"New Delhi: Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan have been expelled from Aam Aadmi Party for their anti-party activities. This has cut short the political ambitions of the two rebellious leaders. While Bhushan’s father had cursed Kejriwal, the expelled duo still have hopes of regaining back their lost position.

While they were steadfast in their decision to uphold Swaraj in AAP, they cannot do so by remaining outside the party. Their dream can be made into reality only when they are into the party. And that is why, the expelled duo have planned to win back the heart of Kejriwal, without any compromise on their stand.

Ready to toil hard

To achieve that, they have planned to implement the movie logic. Yadav explained it to us, “Whenever a hero wants to win the heart of his lover, he will stand outside her home, right across her room’s window. The longer he stays, more sooner she falls in love with him. Not only for lovers, this has also worked for father-son, mother-son, brother-sister, etc. In short, this works out for anyone who wants to win others without compromising their ambitions. We are going to do that only. “

Bhushan took over when Yadav stopped, “Not only between relatives, I have seen some South Indian movies where highly ambitious men will stand outside the doors of rich businessmen, film producers braving the scorching sun and thunderstorms, night and day. And the producer or businessman will let his servant call the hero and provide him with opportunities, with which he can go up in life. We are going to do that now. This is summer season. So, we will prove our loyalty to party by standing outside Kejriwal’s home. We will stand opposite his home’s window, across his gate. He cannot miss watching us, whenever he goes out of his home. We are not going to give up our Swaraj but we will also not give up our party. We will stand outside Arvind’s home till he takes us back into the party.”

“It will be more dramatic if it rains when we stand. He loves drama no?” quipped Yogendra.

When we asked the reason for not choosing other member’s residence, they said, “Ashutosh gave us his address once. But we could not locate such street even in Google Maps.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/shaitan-bhoot-and-pishach-not-sure-about-whom-to-support-during-bihar-elections-8458,"Patna: The war of words between Lalu Yadav and Narendra Modi has not only confused the voters in Bihar but has also divided the Shaitan, Bhoot and Pishach community in Bihar.

A ghost confused about whom to support

After political parties resorted to name calling, which led to Shaitans coming under spotlight, many from the community thought it would be wise discuss and reach a consensus about whom they would vote for the upcoming Bihar elections.

A discussion held in a graveyard by a committee that represents the community of Ghosts and Witches, sought to reach a consensus regarding whom to support during the Bihar Elections.

A bunch of Pishach’s openly supported Lalu Yadav. “Laluji is not against beef eaters. His views work for me. If BJP comes to power in Bihar, we will have to starve,” said Munni Pishcah as other Pishach’s wailed in support.

A few Bhoots chose to differ. “Modiji is best for Bihar and our community. He is never in one place and prefers roaming around. As a bhoot, it appeals to me. If BJP wins in Bihar, I will get a chance to not only roam across Bihar, but also go to foreign locations,” said Bhootnath, a 75 year old ghost.

Meanwhile, a Shaitan who was moderating the discussion and not let anyone speak screamed at the top of his voice and said, “Ghosts and witches the phone lines are open, please call and let us know who will you vote for?”

The discussion was marked with a lot of disagreements, with no consensus having reached. The second half of the discussion turned into a heated debate with name calling and wild accusations.

Bhoot called the Chudail as Lalu and Chudail called Shaitan as Modi with chaotic scenes witnessed by Faking News reporter.

Uddhav Thackeray rehearsing for the Ghazal concert

Speaking to Faking News the party chief said, “I would like to clarify my party’s stand on this issue once and for all. I am not against Ghulam Ali in fact I am also a fan of the singer. I am against Pakistan’s support to terror activities. But, I know a lot of people have already purchased tickets for the concert, so for the benefit of those people I have agreed to sing Ghazals myself.”

Sena leader Sanjay Raut added, “Uddhav saheb is a very good singer and has been singing since his college days. Very few people are aware about this side of his personality. He is very passionate about photography and singing and has given many stage performances also.”

Many of those who were disappointed with the cancellation of the show are now hoping that Uddhav Thackeray’s performance will be worth their money.

However, Cousin Raj Thackeray has advised Uddhav to reconsider his decision. “Tomorrow the party may oppose New Years concert by a celeb. Do you expect Uddhavji to perform there too?” he asked our reporter in his trademark style.

Meanwhile, BJP was critical of Shiv Sena chief’s offer to sing. “We know Uddhavji through his performance will take potshot at us again. He will use Ghulam Ali’s ghazal ‘Chupke Chupke raat din ansoo bahana yaad hai’ point out how Shiv Sena found itself isolated after elections. Also, ‘baatein jhooti baatein hai’ will give him a chance to criticize us on not keeping the promises made before elections.

Although, BJP has said that the show venue can be changed from Mumbai to Delhi there were reports that some ‘ban-loving’ groups were already protesting against Ghulam Ali’s entry into India.

“Ghulam anagrams to Mughal and we cannot let him set foot in the country after what Mughals did to our country,” said an activist belonging to one such group as he raised slogans against the singer.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/uddhav-ghulam-ali-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/uddhav-thackeray-to-sing-ghazals-for-those-who-paid-for-the-tickets-of-ghulam-ali-concert-8455,Uddhav Thackeray to sing Ghazals for those who paid for the tickets of Ghulam Ali concert,,1444297284.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Arvind Kejriwal reacting after someone asked him what he will do if people of Bihar will not allow him to change his DP

Taking time out from his busy weekend movie marathon schedule, Kejriwal announced via his twitter account that he will take this step to avoid any confusion and rumors among people including him and Lalu Prasad Yadav.

He also said that he is different from Modi and believes in democracy. He will change his DP only after people of Bihar will allow him to do so.

Later, AAP spokesperson Ashutosh in press conference declared the date of ‘DP parivartan rally’ in Patna. Rally will be addressed by Arvind Kejriwal where he will ask people as to whether he should change DP or not.

When journalist from TimePass News asked, ”Did Kejriwal get this idea from Mark Zuckerberg?” Ashutosh reacted instantly and blamed Modi for it.

He said, “It is original idea of Arvind ji. When Arvind ji met Modi ji after taking oath of Delhi Chief Minister, he shared this idea with Modi ji.” AAP spokesperson further accused Modi to tell this idea to Mark Zuckerberg during his recent visit of Facebook head quarter.

Reacting to question from journalist that did Kejriwal support Lalu Yadav as both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav are in alliance, Ashutosh asked in reply, “Did you support internet.org when you changed DP to support digital india?” Journalist couldn’t ask more questions as Ashutosh burst into tears.

Some journalists speculate that Ashutosh is missing his mother. When one journalist asked about sudden tears, Ashutosh replied,”Modi” and left the pressconference.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/due-to-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-delhi-is-filled-with-clean-water-which-is-causing-dengue-aap-8426,"New Delhi. For the exponential rise of dengue cases in Delhi, AAP blames the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which PM launched last year. Recently AAP constituted an internal committee under Mr. Ashutosh to find out the reason behind the outbreak of dengue in the capital.

After missing few deadlines it had internally set for itself, Ashutosh submitted the preliminary report to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal when he was the watching “Calendar Girls” along with the cast and crew of the movie at his residence.

Though the report is not yet available in public domain, Mr. Ashutosh was kind enough to speak to us on the condition of anonymity because it is the first time he got a chance to head a party committee. We started by asking what is the reason behind the delay, as his predecessor Yogendra Yadav used to be ready with reports within a day or two. Mr. Ashutosh said, “This is not a report for electoral win or loss. We cannot be casual while preparing this report as dengue can potentially take away so many lives. We looked at all the aspects before making our conclusion.”

Ashutosh called us Modi agent when we suggested if his tears were cause of so much water around.

“According to us, the major reason is the abundant quantity of clean water in Delhi which as all of us know helps in the breeding of dengue mosquitos. Last year when PM launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, we could not protest properly because of our internal party issues. Now the bigger question is, why this was launched without understanding the side effects it can cause.”

Mr. Ashutosh added further, “We have done research to find dengue mosquitos bites proportionately higher number of AAP supporters. After we came to power, there is not much scope for strikes and protests, so most of our supporters take rest during day time when the dengue mosquitos are most active. We also stay in smaller houses. It is easy for the mosquito to travel from one room to other. One mosquito can potentially bite a full family within an hour”.

“Look at the central ministers, they stay in big bungalows surrounded by so many people all the time. Difficult for a mosquito to travel to all the rooms, even if it reach some room it will get confused with whom to bite as so many people will be present. Unlike them, we do not have so many supporters right now to hang around us”.

Mr. Ashutosh told us about the few recommendations he is going to submit in his final report to Akela Aadmi Party head Mr. Kejriwal. “We have told our supporters to remain active at least during the day time. If needed, we will launch few protests and strikes to keep them occupied. No need for us to follow Swachh Bharat Campaign to keep the water bodies in around us clean. We will soon find a way to make the water bodies unfriendly for dengue mosquitos”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/368-300x168.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/due-to-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-delhi-is-filled-with-clean-water-which-is-causing-dengue-aap-8426,"Due to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Delhi is filled with clean water which is causing dengue: AAP",,1443511760.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Last year UN adopted June 21st as world yoga day and now USA state department has recognized his importance and marked a day to honor his oratory skills which whole world has now started acknowledging. From next year onwards, last Sunday of September will be known as world onsite ‘mann ki baat’ day.

PM Modi getting ready for his first Mann ki Baat in US

The significance of the day will be, the head of a country can travel to a foreign location of his interest to address the people located there.

As per our sources, on this day, Modiji prefers to be in USA which is considered as the ultimate onsite job location for our techies.

As per the organizers of the event, unlike offshore ‘mann ki baat’ which is a monthly affair, onsite one will be yearly affair purely because of the logistics it demands. The venue will not be fixed, it will be rotated as this will give fair chance to people who are interested to see him live in action.

For next ten years the organizers have already shortlisted quite a few prestigious squares, corners and halls for this purpose.

USA state department has also pitched in to help. There will be no NBA matches for that matter no major sporting action, no live concert in the city which will host Modi’s address.

As this event will have bigger crowds than what they normally see during US presidential campaign, the department will arrange special public transport to help people reach venue on time and also to get back home without any hassle.

Tenders will be issued to select best of golgappa, vada pav, bhajji vendors from India who will be allowed to put their stalls. This will help in attracting even bigger crowds to the venue who would like to have taste of India.

We met senior Pravasi Bharatiya Mr. Velu who is staying in US for last thirty years. When we asked what makes Modiji so popular in spite of his so many foreign trips, he said, “Modiji is a real charmer. If you closely observe, you will find unlike our cricket team who are poor while travelling overseas, Modiji’s demeanour and public address ability remains pitch perfect even on foreign land. He has travelled to so many places belonging to different continents, everywhere he has been consistent. It will be hard for anyone to find even a single flaw in the speeches he has given.”

“This is all because the hard work he has put in to understand the pulse of the people who will be attending his public address. You will never find his speeches boring. It might be little long, but it will have something for everyone in attendance,” Mr. Velu concluded",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/usa-state-department-releases-new-calendar-for-2016-marks-last-sunday-of-sept-as-indian-pms-onsite-mann-ki-baat-day-8419,"USA state department releases new calendar for 2016, marks last Sunday of Sept as Indian PM’s onsite 'mann ki baat' day",,1443326505.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tired-of-being-ignored-on-social-media-woman-changed-her-name-to-arvind-kejriwal-for-visibility-8414,"New Delhi. A woman from Delhi has changed her name to Arvind Kejriwal after she was repeatedly snubbed on social media by everyone other than Facebook and Twitter bots.

Kejriwal angry that people are using him to get publicity

Though reports suggest that the name entered by the applicant on the affidavit was actually #arvindkejriwal, the officials who processed it, erroneously omitted the hashtag as they assumed that it was an attempt to write her title that went wrong.

Speaking to media, she admitted that she wanted her name to be #arvindkejriwal so that she could see her name trending on Twitter the entire day, but in hindsight, she is glad that the hashtag was omitted because the topic, according to her, trends on Twitter for all the wrong reasons.

“The name without the hashtag is working just fine. I started getting 100 new Twitter followers every day, and now it’s performing even better since my husband has uploaded an image of a muffler as profile picture. Most importantly, the followers here retweet unlike those dead followers my other profile has. Even my Facebook account has exhausted 5000 friend limit,” she said.

She quickly checked her Twitter feed and continued, “Although, I am not sure why I am getting strange parcels and letters since I changed my name, like yesterday I received a ‘Punch-in-the-Box’ from someone who calls himself Governor’s office.”

Later at 9 pm, somewhere in a newsroom, a gentleman sitting alarmingly close to a bespectacled angry host expressed his concern, “This sets a dangerous precedent. Now we might see thousands of Rahul Gandhis, Narendra Modis, Arvind Kejriwals, and even Arnab Goswami’s. This would make life difficult for everyone, especially those who work in the postal department,” he said as he glanced at the host of the show from the corner of his eye.

However, experts don’t consider this an unusual incident, as renouncing one’s real identity on social networking websites is a common practice. According to them, a person suffering from Social Media Despondency Syndrome (SMDS) exhibits a behavioral pattern where he or she uploads a photograph on Twitter or Facebook, refreshes the page a few times, and then screams, “Cheater cocks, I liked all your posts!” and then quietly changes his or her username to a popular one.

As a matter of fact, they use famous names as user Id’s on social networking websites even before those famous personalities get to know about those platforms. The experts, however, feel that she has overreacted and that she could have just changed her username instead of real name.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kejriwal-angry.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tired-of-being-ignored-on-social-media-woman-changed-her-name-to-arvind-kejriwal-for-visibility-8414,"Tired of being ignored on social media, woman changed her name to Arvind Kejriwal for visibility",,1443170410.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Faking News managed to get an exclusive interview with ‘Don’, as he wasn’t comfortable giving one to Arnab Goswami. He claimed he did not have enough decibels in his bark to match up to the noise generated by Arnab on his show ‘Noisehour’.

FN: Why did you abscond only to later get caught sleeping at your owner’s office?

Don: Since I was named Don, I had to act like one. Have you forgotten ‘ Don ka intezaar toh 11 mulkon ki Police kar rahi hai, par don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi namumkin hai”

FN: Rumors say you had gone to Kejriwal for help?

Don: Yes, I did try to meet him many a times. But he was either occupied watching some movie or was busy being upset with me. I even tried to change my get up to match with that of the dog in ‘Entertainment’, hoping now that I am officially from film industry, he would be keen to meet me. But sadly, it didn’t happen.

‘Don’, when asked to imitate voters of Delhi.

FN: So, how do you feel now after having being caught by Delhi Police?

Don: I thought I was Somnath’s Ashutosh, following every orders of him, but he treated me like Yogendra Yadav instead. Just like Yogendra was deserted by Kejriwal and had to sleep on floor, Bharti too has left me alone in Police Station to sleep on floor. I should have realized that my master’s priorities lie with safeguarding only beautiful women. And leave alone beautiful, I am not even female.

FN: But why do you think Somnath did not come for your help?

Don: Whenever he wanted to get something out of his wife Lipika, he would pester me to go on a fast, when she would not agree. He said since I was overweight, I was perfect for such gimmicks and wouldn’t even die. When I would refuse, he would get upset and start spamming mails of random people to cool him down. I think he is still mad at me.

FN: Tell us something more about the camaraderie you shared with Bharti during good times.

Don: We had lot of similarities. Like me, my master was most active during night. He too had a habit of not letting people sleep by raiding random houses, just like I don’t let people sleep by barking incessantly. In fact, I think Somnath was right when he claimed that he made that midnight raid at Khirki extension for women safety. He ventured out of his house during night, so that women in his house could remain safe.

FN: Are you disheartened with how you are being treated?

Don: Yeah, but I am also happy to be have become second most famous dog in Aam Aadmi Party after Ashutosh’s Mogu.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/somnath-bharti-dog-don_650x400_81442322295-300x184.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/exclusive-interview-with-somnath-bhartis-dog-8385,Exclusive interview with Somnath Bharti's dog,,1442392080.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Pak flag being waved in Kashmir

“All blockades and tripping objects are a conspiracy. They are hurting our brethren,” asserted an unidentified youth waving the flag.

“If some more people keep falling down, we will go to Pakistan,” he threatened.

Even after the man himself admitted that he fell by mistake, the protesters have become more vocal in their agitation against the country.

“Today he slipped and survived. Tomorrow he might slip and he might die how will India protect him? We will not let our brother speak at all. We will speak on his behalf,” he added.

The man who fell down however has escaped his ‘brothers’ clutches and has come forth to the media to explain that it was his mistake and nobody pushed him.

“First of all I am not even a Kashmiri, in fact not even a Muslim, so I don’t know why they want to speak for me,” said Yin Min Yong, who was visiting Kashmir from China.

“I was walking normally but I stepped on underwear made using the ISIS flag, so I ended up slipping and falling down. I don’t know why they are causing unnecessary problem,” he questioned.

Hearing about this reason, many sensible Muslim supporters have left the group of protesters, while others insisted that China was an ally of Pakistan and thus they had all rights to speak on the issue.

“We don’t care about them. Soon there will be some other reason and we will convince them to come join us again. We make sure we feel everyone is victimized by India so any reason will be enough for us. Till then we will keep waving Pakistan’s flag,” said another individual condemning people who decided to end protests.

Due to ISIS flags being used as chaddis by poor Kashmiri kids, the protesters are searching for extra flags, by which they can protest more vociferously.

“We are out of flags so we are willing to accept any others apart from the Indian flag to start protesting. We are in the process of creating some flags containing upside down vada pavs and dosas to rebel against India,” said a volunteer.

There are also some talks that if the temperature increases by some more degrees melting snow in Kashmir, Pakistani flag will again be waved to protest against this attack on Kashmiriyat.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pak-flag.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-trips-and-falls-down-by-accident-in-kashmir-unidentified-youth-wave-pakistani-flag-8381,"Man trips and falls down by accident in Kashmir, unidentified youth wave Pakistani flag",,1442301406.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Ashish the rooster, who organized the flash mob, spoke to Faking News amidst a sea of chickens that gyrated to latest bollywood numbers.

“We all are very happy with the meat ban. Few extra days to live mean a lot to us. So we are celebrating. I thank the Jain community for this favor. Some people say that it is politics, but we don’t care,” he said.

It was not just a chicken affair, media also was present and doing their best to manufacture something that could garner TRPs. Social media too was abuzz with the news as #chickenflashmob dominated the trending topic in India.

While there were celebrations all around in different poultry farms, a group of chicken was seen standing in a corner and protesting, hoping that the media would turn their cameras at the group.

The most vocal of the lot, wearing a muffler and topi was seen raising slogans against Shiv Sena chief for not supporting the ban. “I am wondering who is better at taking U-turns, is it Uddhav Thackeray or CM of Delhi.” he screamed.

They were also planning pre-emptive protest against a news anchor, who they believe would take up the issue of ‘meat ban’ on his debate and give it a religious twist.

“Our brothers are on the job and they are planning to gatecrash the debate. All we ask for is a few days reprieve and even that does not go down well with some people,” he said.

Meanwhile, some chickens that were picked up before the meat ban was announced were hopeful that they would get a day’s reprieve. “I was headed for KFC, but now with this meat ban, I am looking forward to going back home.

Sunny Leone and Diapers done, what next?

According to Anjan, the diaper advertisements which showcase excessive absorption capacity are actually provoking the babies to pass susu more frequently thereby dirtying the moral fabric of the country.

Speaking at a press conference Anjan spoke on this issue in scathing words and said, “These advertisements are ridiculous, as they are promoting the innocent babies to do excessive susu. And the worst part is that a lot of fabric and cloth becomes dirty and is wasted because the mothers of these babies try to keep them clean even when they are not wearing diapers. I am strictly against dirtying of any kind of fabric in this country, be it normal fabric or moral fabric.”

He further continued, “You can call us Marxists, Leninists, Communists, Illusionist, Machinist, Pianist whatever but we believe in welfare of all people, except people in Nandigram. They are not even “people”, I believe. So when we care for people so much then we are the ones who will decide how many milligrams of susu and potty will each person in out rule, release every day, especially the babies. We the communists actually control the urine cycle of babies and it’s high time diaper companies stop interfering with that.”

He was later seen severely scolding people who were queuing outside the men’s restroom after the press conference concluded.

While diaper companies and central government have not replied to Anjan’s sharp accusations, Anjan is taking this campaign even a step further.

“Modi government had chosen Janmashtami to announce OROP, instead of Eid. This shows the state of minorities in Modi’s India”, remarked a famous Adarsh Liberal.

Talking at a press meet convened immediately after the announcement of OROP (One Rank, One Pension), Congress leader Anant Shawarma hit out at the Modi’s tactics of releasing OROP with Bihar elections in mind.

“Modi’s government is not really for the welfare of the people. They only think about their profits from every policy decisions. Every big announcement is made before an election, so that they can garner votes. If we ban elections in India for next 4 years, then, no big laws or policies will be introduced by this government. This is just an election chasing government. Army veterans should not think that Modi government is with them. They are just pawns for winning Bihar elections,” he said.

“Whatever they may do, BJP will surely lose Bihar elections, because our Madamji is always in the heart of Indians, especially Biharis,” intervened Divgijay Snigh.

“It seems there is an RSS hand in the announcement of OROP. RSS met BJP recently and BJP comes with this announcement. Seems RSS wants to win the allegiance of army soldiers and later form an army to bring terror to the people here,” he added.

Kipal Salib said, “Who said Congress rejected OROP? It was rejected by Antony. He is not Congress. Sirf Madamji aur uska beta Congress hain. Rahul’s granny Indiraji removed OROP, because armymen not really wanted OROP. But, Congress always wanted to provide something to them. We tried to bring it in Rajivji’s government, but he instead came up with ‘One Tank, One Mansion’.

“So, we were waiting for Rahulji to become PM and bring back OROP. But, Indian voters betrayed us. They chose Modi instead.

“AAP unit of Bihar had made all preparations for Kejriwals arrival including screening of latest movie, but with his return back to Delhi we have cancelled our door to door campaign,” said a party worker.

Lalu Prasad Yadav’s RJD that recently coalesced with the incumbent CM’s JD(U) was found to be the prime reason of Kejriwal’s return to Delhi.

As per our sources, Lalu was hurriedly walking towards Nitish to check if he’s coming online this afternoon. As he was fast approaching the CM, the latter had his epiphanic moment where he realized the long-standing superstition of Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada.

Here’s what seems to have gone through his mind:

“What if Lalu jinxes my chances to continue being the CM? What if Manjhi takes advantage of my weakness of believing in superstitions? He could even link it to the temple cleaning incident. I better send this guy back to Delhi. Jugaad can be planned on phone too. Whom to choose? Fodder? U-Turn? Fodder? U-Turn? I think I should make a move.”

Intellectuals believe Nitish should have asked Yo Yo Honey Singh to accompany Kejriwal to Patna as his presence would have added up the number of important people to 4.

Some AAP workers suggested that Kejriwal get Ashutosh along to add up people and thereby avoiding any jinx.

Others said that Nitish should’ve asked ministry officials to escort Kejriwal directly to a nearby multiplex for avoiding Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3idiots_1423053517-300x196.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/revealed-nitish-kumar-sent-arvind-kejriwal-back-to-delhi-citing-teen-tigada-kaam-bigada-as-reason-8352,"Revealed: Nitish Kumar sent Arvind Kejriwal back to Delhi citing ""Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada"" as reason",,1441429278.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/haryana-govt-forms-committee-to-find-a-department-where-likes-of-khemka-can-be-safely-transferred-7783,"New Delhi. To put an end to the trouble faced by honest IAS officers in the country and their state, Haryana Govt has today decided to find a department where likes of Ashok Khemka can be safely transferred.

The decision was taken after Khemka was transferred yet again to archaeology department.

Fearing they may have to again take out time to decide where to transfer him in 1 or 2 weeks, Haryana govt has once and for all decided to address root cause of their the problem.

No department for honest IAS men.

“We have formed a committee headed by some ex-IAS officers, who for the first few weeks will look if at all there is a department, where work done by honest IAS officers doesn’t threaten our their life in any way,” said a top minister from BJP govt in Haryana.

“If they can’t come up with one, we will then invent one such department, where IAS officers aren’t burdened with the workload of bringing out corruption and reforms. We have certain political parties to take care of that,” he added.

“Also if we don’t address this problem now, soon we will run out of places and departments to transfer Khemka. We can’t send him to same department again, that will hardly be challenging for him as a passionate IAS officer,” he conclude, how steps taken by govt were in the best interests of Kehmka.

Haryana govt further rubbished allegations that the govt was doing nothing to protect whistle-blowers in the state.

“It’s bullshit and baseless. We are well aware that too much of whistle blowing is hazardous to one’s health, and that it can cause asthma attack. It is out of this concern only for the well being of our IAS officers, that we are taking such steps,” said Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar.

Congress govt in Karnataka too has given thumbs up to the decision and promised to assist Haryana govt in their find.

“We must keep political ideologies apart and promote such good initiatives wholeheartedly,” said the Karnataka CM, who is confident no honest IAS officer will be murdered by Mafia, once such a department is in place.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,"Patna. Immediately after Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar advised the protesting nurses in his state to not stage hunger strike in the sun as that will make them dark, JDU leader and dark skin enthusiast Sharad Yadav lambasted him for such remarks.

Saying that Parsekar was spreading lies and misconception, Yadav appealed to nurses in Goa to not pay attention to him and carry on with protests.

“To say that having dark skin spoils marital prospects for girls is utter bullshit. Look at Michelle Obama. US president married her,” pointed Sharad Yadav, arguing that he was sure Indian men also thought like him.

“Khabardaar”

Yadav further lashed out at Parsekar for playing a spoilsport at what was a golden opportunity to do ‘Rang Wapsi’ of some Indian women.

“This was in fact blessing in disguise, that nurses without caring about what will happen to their skin, went under sun to protest, and this man by reminding them of their complexion just spoiled the party,” Yadav said angrily.

“Out here in Bihar, we deliberately don’t fulfill wishes and demands of female section of the society, so that they are forced to protest under sun and get dark complexioned, thereby becoming dusky beauties. This BJP leader ought to learn from us,” the JDU leader said, once again justifying how their break up from NDA was indeed a right decision.

Sharad Yadav now intends to gatecrash into Goa assembly and debate with Goa CM and his MLAs about skin color of women in India, and how steps should be taken to ensure dark skinned women don’t become extinct.

“The only positive part about Parsekar’s statement is that there is at least one politician in this country who thinks that complexion is very much a debatable topic and much more important than corruption or any other issue,” Yadav said as he left for Goa.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thumb.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,Sharad Yadav blasts Goa CM for advising Nurses against getting dark,,1427874333.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg who earlier today alleged that he received fake calls in the name of Arun Jaitely and Nitin Gadkari, asking him to support BJP few months back, claims that he smelled rat when one of the callers on the phone identified himself as Manmohan Singh.

As per Garg, after Kejriwal ordered calls to be made to him and other MLAs to show BJP was indulging in horse trading and poaching, he, in order to maintain neutrality, also asked his aide cum loyalist Sanjay Singh to get few fake calls made from Congress representatives as well.

Garg laughed his ass out, when caller identified himself as Manmohan

But AAP members being AAP members, of all the leaders in Congress, they chose Manmohan’s name, which made Rajesh suspicious and he knew it was a hoax.

“Truth be told, initially I was stunned and honored to be the first person to whom Manmohan sir has chose to speak to. But as the realization dawned, I knew this can’t be true,” the former MLA from Rohini disclosed to the Faking News reporter.

“There was no Theek Hai, no words about Rahul Gandhi ji’s leadership, I mean that’s not the Manmohan this world or I know,” he further argued.

“Also do you really think a person who did open his mouth for 10 years, when he was PM, would do so when he is not one anymore,” he asked.

Rajesh Garg claims that Kejriwal and the caller knew Mahmohan Singh’s persona inside out and just tried to take advantage of that.

“Taking Manmohan’s name was safest option for them, as knowing him really well, even if the news reached his ears, he would do nothing to counter this allegation,” Rajesh Garg explained.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rajesh-garg-aap-mla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajesh-garg-says-he-smelled-rat-when-calls-were-made-by-aap-in-the-name-of-manmohan-singh-7773,Rajesh Garg says he smelled rat when calls were made by AAP in the name of Manmohan Singh,,1427797827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Ahmedabad. A local Church was heavily damaged by an unknown lightning in the outskirts of this city last night. While police is investigating the matter, activists and some journalists are insisting that Hindutva groups were behind the act.

Around 11 PM last night, a bright lightning was spotted by neighbors of the Church along with a heavy thunder. Within few seconds, there were sounds of glass breaking and security of the Church could sense smoke billowing out of the church.

“Once the smoke started coming out, I rushed to the altar and found that the lightning had cracked the glass windows and burnt a few wooden benches. I doused the fire immediately and then called the police,” a security guard at the Church told this reporter.

CCTV capture of lightning entering the church to attack it. Police is unable to nab the lightning even with such clear proofs. This proves that minorities are not safe in India.

However, some groups believe that the police shouldn’t rule out a foul play. Speaking to Faking News, Robert Salvo, an ex-IAS officer, said, “We asked for rains so that farmers benefit, but Modi’s India is sending lightning down our churches and thunders down our hearts. I feel like I’m on a hitlist.”

One expert has cleared doubts that had been clouding over the clouds and have squarely blamed Modi and RSS as responsible for the attacks.

“This is nothing but a very long conspiracy by the Hindutva groups. Cloud seeding technique is not new, and these groups are known to be tech savvy. It will be shame if police doesn’t investigate this angle,” Darana Ayub, an investigative journalist said.

Mr. Ayub also wrote an article on how minorities were being targeted by accidents, fire, storm, and earthquakes in Modi’s India.

“You can’t blame external factors like clouds and rains. It is a homegrown monster. We should open our eyes and see the threat. Modi had quoted ‘where the head is held high’ to Christians last month and now, can we hold our head high and face the sky during rain or lightning? Modi must answer this,” the article said.

Activists have also expressed unhappiness over the direction in which investigation was moving.

“Police is asking the Church to setup lightning arrestors to prevent such incidents in future. Why is the police asking us to arrest lightning? Can’t they do it?” an activist protested.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tumblr_nfhx10ow2c1r7u6l5o1_1280.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Lightning strikes a Church in Gujarat, Hindutva groups alleged to be behind it",,1427792777.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Mumbai: ‘Manoranjan ka Baap’ – IPL has met its real daddy, the Aam Aadmi Party. Internal fight among AAP cadres is driving the TRP’s of news channels so high that BCCI is considering postponing IPL-8 till either the political entertainment stops or viewers get bored of it and start demanding change.

According to the sources, it is the first time that IPL is feeling competition from any other source of entertainment. Neither Bollywood movies nor LS elections (2009/2014) ever posed any threat to IPL before.

Full on entertainment.

“When the ruckus started in early March we thought that it will cover for a rather dull Cricket world cup and then by the time country gets ready for IPL, AAP will manage to douse the fire and people will shift focus on Cricket. But new stings just keep coming out of nowhere and neither News channels nor people are ready to give us any attention. If we don’t get any TRP there is no point conducting it,” explained a forever poker faced IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla.

“Does it mean IPL is losing its relevance in the fascist regime that is prevailing in the country lately?” Shaitaan Khopdi™ tried do a Sagarika Ghose, to which Rajiv Shukla replied, “IPL means entertainment. When there is enough of it available 24×7, why would people watch our matches that last only 4 hours?”

Shaitaan Khopdi™ argued, “But IPL’s main objective was to provide international exposure to domestic players and overall betterment of Cricket in India, BCCI should go ahead with the schedule without worrying about TRP.” However Shukla explained that it was just a ‘Jumla’ and should not be taken seriously.

Shukla was then asked, “Does BCCI have a plan if the AAP entertainment refuses to stop?”

“We have created a ‘Mauka’ type ad where we insert ‘Cricket’ in political news to remind people that they are supposed to watch IPL during March-April. This will be played during prime time Ad breaks on news channels in Ravi Shastri’s voice,” Shukla replied.

“It goes like this: Right at the start of ‘Power-Play’, AAP captain gets ‘Retired Hurt’ and goes Bangalore to get ‘Just what the doctor ordered’. Right then, experienced bowlers Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan overstep the line, giving Vice-captain Sisodia free-hits. He gladly hits both like ‘A tracer bullet’ for the ‘Yes Bank Maximum’. During the ‘Strategic Time out’ stump microphone picks up a conversation which exposes that AK rigged the auctions by trying to fix 6 players that were retained by Congress. Delhi immediately asks for a review against this ‘Karbonn Kamaal Catch’. Election Commission informs that Delhi has already lost their review on 7th Feb and next review will be available only in 2020,” Shukla revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-yogendra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Fearing low TRPs, BCCI postpones IPL-8 till AAP infighting stops",,1427715318.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With growing need to address frequent Press Conferences every now and then, senior leader of AAP, Yogendra Yadav has decided to open an in house Press Club at his residence in Rewari.

Henceforth all his Press Conferences will be held at this Press Club.

“Of late, the need for having a Press Club in my house has become even more important than having a washroom. I do more PCs in a day than the number of times I go to my washroom,” Yogendra Yadav explained, confirming the development. “Now I will do PCs as and when I want.”

Yogendra Yadav’s last PC outside residence.

Yogendra Yadav further argued Kejriwal had a clear advantage over him when it comes to addressing Press Conferences because of the fact that he is based out of Delhi.

“And by the time I reach Delhi or Gurgaon from here, Kejriwal camp already does 3-4 PCs and I again have to do catching up. I am already lagging behind them, and have to cover it up and maintain a healthy lead over them quickly,” revealed Yogendra.

“Me and Bhushan ji can ill afford to waste time in transit,” he added.

Over and above opening a Press Club, the psephologist turned politician has also decided to hire a Media Manager for managing these conferences.

“Not only this, it would be nicer if some of those news channels and media outlets permanently send their reporters and camera person on an onsite duty to my residence. This will help in quick dissemination of the news,” Yogendra Yadav told Faking News, assuring a separate space for them as well at his residence.

Meanwhile Kejriwal camp has decided to raise questions in their next PC over the source from where Yogendra Yadav camp is getting money to construct Press Club and hire Media managers.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yogendra-yadav-prashant-bhushan_650x400_61427552245.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/yogendra-yadav-to-open-a-mini-press-club-at-his-residence-for-quick-press-confrerences-7760,Yogendra Yadav to open a mini press club at his residence for quick Press Confrerences,,1427700435.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/exclusive-transcript-of-aap-meeting-that-saw-yadav-and-bhushan-removed-7756,"New Delhi. Faking News has been able to acquire a full transcript of what really went on inside the AAP National Executive (NE) meet yesterday. We can verify the authenticity of this transcript as this was purchased directly from the members of AAPs official sting making body, which is known as KAC (Khufia Affairs Committee). Below is the full, original, unedited, and uncensored* transcript, for your enlightenment:

– Scene: Around 350 unshaven, sweaty, slightly obese men sitting around a table discussing burning issues that impact the aam admi today, like India’s exit from the World Cup and who would win the IPL. Certain MLAs could also be seen betting money even as Prasant Bhusan protested against unethical activities like cricket betting. Amidst the general din, Arvind Kejriwal stands up to begin his inaugural speech –

Arvind Kejriwal (AK): Upasthit sabhya aur asabhya mahoday, I thank you all for coming, and Admiral Ramdas for not coming, to this momentous occasion. I would like to start by saying how deeply hurt I am seeing all the muck being thrown around among party members in the past few weeks. I went to Bengaluru to get toxins removed from my system, however I fear with so much toxicity surrounding me, no natural or supernatural cure can come to my aide.

– Ashutosh is seeing trying to hold back his tears, Mayank Gandhi typing away a new blog on his laptop –

AK continues: You know, I formed this party to fight against corrupt people like Gadkari, Modi, and Arnab. But I can’t fight against my own colleagues. It is against my principles and sensibilities. Hence I believe it would be best to kick them out.

– Abruptly, he starts singing, horribly out of tune, the song ‘In The End’ by Linkin Park, to show his state of mind. Most members put on earphones, while Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan , Manish Sisodia and a few others start singing along –

AK: I can live with many things, be it chronic coughs, itchy mufflers, cold Delhi footpaths, or African women, but betrayal of trust is the one thing I can not accept. You must choose now between me or the rebels. I would want a fair voting, hence I state beforehand that anyone voting against me would face no discrimination. Though in my meeting earlier with Dalai Lama, I requested a handful of Shaolin Monks from him, in case I need to ‘control’ people indulging in ‘anti party activities’. Now if you would excuse me I have an urgent appointment with Azam Khan regarding the plight of aam buffaloes in India.

– AK stands up to exit the scene. Prashant Bhushan stands up with great alarm –

Prashant Bhushan (PB): You gaddar! We raised you, trained you! Made you who you are today! Without us you are nothing! You can’t kick us out without a fight! We want a trial by combat!

– PB picks up a chair and charges towards AK. Suddenly, two burly men appear from nowhere and promptly puts PB in his place. The men are revealed to be Jason Momoa and Dwane Jonson –

Yadav happy to come out of the meet without any injuries

Yogendra Yadav (YY) – visibly shaken – : W..who are these people?!

Manish Sisodia (MS) : They are members of the NE.

YY: What? But I’ve never seen them before!

MS: They are temporary members.. like, only for today.

PB – struggling to get up – : This is blasphemy! A murder of democracy! You are acting like the dark lord Sauron!

MS: Whatever. Enough of this shit! I propose that we kick these two, along with a few of their helpers, out of the NE. All those in favour raise their hands.

YY: Discussion! We want a discussion!!

Gopal Rai: Sure. Give us in writing. Make sure it’s at least 1000 words or more. Plus you get extra marks for judicious use of quotes and allegories.

– Meanwhile the count of hands continues. Some members, like Sisodia and Ashustosh can be seen putting up both hands –

PB: Now WTF is this!? Why are they allowed to put up both hands?!

Ashutosh: Why should we discriminate between both our hands? Do you mean to say one hand has more rights than the other? Is this the swaraj you believe in?

-Vote counting ends –

MS: 280 votes in favour, 8 votes against. Damn, this is like an India Pakistan WC match, not even close. LOL!

YY: This is all pre scripted. The drama being played out here seems to be written by Ekta Kapoor!

Gopal Rai: These are serious allegations. Do you have any proof?

YY: Proof?! You need more proof?! Why was our internal lokpal not allowed to attend the proceedings?

GR: Oh that’s simple. His term is coming to an end, so we decided to hire a new lokpal. In fact we have him here with us today. Please come in – gestures towards the door –

– To the visible shock and dismay of the rebels, ACP Pradyuman enters the hall. At this moment, the YY and PB camp realises the hopelessness of the situation and decides to make a hasty retreat –

In another letter leaked from AAP, albeit this time not from Prashant Bhushan, it has been found that AAP supreme Arvind Kejriwal thanked Indian captain MS Dhoni and Times Now for helping shift focus away from massive internal war within AAP yesterday.

Worried that the most massive showdown within AAP would be hogging headlines everywhere on Prime time, Kejriwal was relieved to find ace anchor Arnab Goswami debating about India’s defeat in semi-final match against Australia instead for one hour.

Extending an olive branch to Arnab

“I was wrong about Arnab ji all along. He is not anti-AAP and certainly not anybody’s agent,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

He further told us how pleasantly shocked he was to see no media person question him about those sting tapes, ever since he returned from Bangalore.

“So somewhere I had this feeling even this thing will not get coverage from Media, but the massiveness of the rift had me in two minds and I thought maybe they will,” Kejriwal confessed.

“Also I thought this time now that India has lost and these channels would have nothing else to discuss about cricket further and they would certainly shift focus to us. But thanks to Arnab and Times Now for setting the narrative and shifting focus from us,” Kejriwal added.

When asked why did he thank Dhoni in his letter, Kejriwal shot back, “Do you really think had it not been for his effort and conduct in the world cup, Indians would have got united in standing behind him?”

Kejriwal further expressed satisfaction over no trend related to AAP hogging limelight on Twitter with #ShameonTimesNow attracting attention of one and all.

So much so that AAP volunteers did not even bother to trend stuff like #AKweAreWithYou #OpportunistBhushanYadav or any other such hashtag on Twitter to show their solidarity.

“This time supporters from all political parties were united in going after Times Now,” Kejriwal said, ““sab actually mein mile hue the ji.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-kejriwal-2014-pictures.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-writes-a-thank-you-letter-to-dhoni-and-times-now-for-shifting-focus-off-aaps-massive-internal-war-7743,Kejriwal writes a thank you letter to Dhoni and Times Now for shifting focus off AAP's massive internal war,,1427444021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Bengaluru: Aam Aadmi Party chief and Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, was in the city for treatment for Jindal Hospital. While unreliable sources reveal that he went there for medical treatment, trusted sources reveal that he was there for some other reason.

Highly placed sources, who were in terrace of hospital, passed us several interesting information about stay of Kejriwal there. One such source said, “Kejriwal came here on first week of March along with his parents and was staying here for the past two weeks. The news reports and even the hospital’s medical bulletin reveals that Kejriwal came to Jindal hospital for sugar treatment. But, it is all fabrications. The truth is, Kejriwal checked in here to learn ‘Sign Language’. The photos that they display in newspapers of Kejriwal doing stuffs here is nothing but learning the sign language.”

When we asked about the reason for Sign Learning, another source, which was standing next to our primary source, said, “Kejriwalji is wary of getting caught in stings. He is now scared of each and every AAP volunteer and member. He is avoiding to talk in mobile phones nowadays. He is asking for thorough check of people visiting him. But, how many days can he continue like this? So, he has decided to learn sign language and will be using that sign language to communicate with people who will meet him in future. He is said to have told his tutor that ‘Henceforth I will sign and sign, but not resign’.”

Our Faking News team along with experts have deciphered the step-by-step training given to Kejriwal in Jindal’s hospital here. Our sources affirm that Kejriwal will discuss with anyone who comes to meet him only using these signs:

First, nose is being fine tuned to catch any ‘sting’ probability. This medicine can help Kejriwal find out anyone with camera or recorder by its smell. If found, Kejriwal will show the door(refer the 6th pic)

After the smelling part, then the sign language will start. This sign is to denote the person that “Let the discussion flow, but I will not hear a single word of it”. This means he is not interested to hear him. Will be used for party dissenters.

This sign is to persuade the person to stretch the limits of the discussion & look beyond what is in hands, i.e., announce freebies and look at Modi’s hands for funds.

This sign will be used to denote the person that the discussion is more Left than Right. Now, the direction of discussion will turn from Left to somewhat Right.

This is to bring the topic back from Right to Left. See how the Left Knee is bent upwards to symbolize that Left. The usage of alternate hand-leg is to stress the alternate form of politics that he practices.

This is ‘showing the door’ to the person, if Kejriwal is not happy with the discussion. The person should immediately leave.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/0sL1Z-6.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Kejriwal went to Bangalore to learn Sign Language, to escape future stings: Sources",,1426920872.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Renowned female complexion expert and women body enthusiast Sharad Yadav has today announced launch of ‘Dark and lovely’ skin cream in Indian market.

Sad that nobody decided to take him seriously in the parliament and instead wanted to focus on trivial things like FDI in insurance sector, Yadav chose to take this path to get his thoughts across.

The product however already exists in African market and makers of the same approached Yadav, impressed with his conviction and how he stood by his thoughts for two consecutive sessions in Rajya Sabha.

“Farak dekhiye sirf 5 din mein”

“For years, we were confused as to how we can infiltrate the Indian market as people there are perpetually fairness obsessed. But in Mr Sharad, we found the right brand ambassador for our product and feel he can do wonders in India where even South Indians don’t respect their own skin colour as much as he does,” said spokesperson of ‘Dark and Lovely’ from South Africa.

Immediately after launching the cream, the JDU MP will carry the first tube with him in the Rajya Sabha and apply on the faces of fair skinned women MPs in the parliament.

“I want to end skin color discrimination in this country and what better place to start this noble act than my own workplace,” Sharad Yadav told Faking News, “I will ensure we have no fair skinned MP left in the parliament.”

Yadav further said that he was ready to listen to counter remarks in the debate session, provided they come from dusky complexioned colleagues and thus by applying this cream he was only ensuring that he isn’t compelled to say “I know what you are” again in the parliament.

“Pehle aap apni twacha mere se baat karne ke kaabil banaiye, fir munh kholiye,” declared the dark skin aficionado cum politician, taking a potshot at BJP MP Smriti Irani.

Yadav however rued that he could not do much about the shape of MPs bodies in such a short span of time, but is hopeful of launching a product for that too soon.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sharad-yadav.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-to-launch-dark-and-lovely-cream-in-indian-market-to-apply-on-fair-skinned-female-mps-first-7656,"Sharad Yadav to launch 'Dark and Lovely' cream in Indian market, to apply on fair skinned female MPs first",,1426578989.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"New Delhi: Several questions that have been dogging the minds of Indians for some time have been answered now. Why did Rahul Gandhi vanish? Where is he hiding? How to find him? Why did Congress lose Loksabha elections? And such.

A few days ago, BBC sent out a request to Rahul Gandhi for an interview. That is when Rahul went missing. Dreading the prospect of having to face an interview, he went underground, which has been described variously by the Congress leaders as vacation, winding down, soul searching, meditation, chilling, rejuvenating, brain(?)storming, strategizing, etc. But the fact has been established – Rahul is hiding from BBC. ‘Was hiding’, one should say, because BBC finally found him. One of the Indian journalists who was part of the BBC team related the story in depth, as below.

Two weeks ago, BBC approached Rahul Gandhi through his office, asking for an interview on important matters. The very term ‘important matters’ sent shivers down his spine and he declined to participate. However, BBC doggedly continued their pursuit. When they called him up directly on his personal number, he first did not pick up the calls. Then he said they had reached a wrong number. Then he said he was a different Rahul Gandhi. Then he spoke in a lady’s voice and told BBC that Rahul was out of office.

When he tried the same trick many times, BBC told him that they knew he was lying because they could see him in the office as they too were there. Rahul claimed to have forgotten where he was and told BBC he would meet them in a while. That was the last any one saw or heard of him.

Having waited in Rahul’s office for several days, BBC, in a desperate bid, took the help of a veteran Congress leader and one-man expert committee on Rahul Gandhi affairs, Shankar Iyer Mani (name changed to protect identity). They learnt that come what may, Rahul meets a childhood friend at least once a week, to exchange comics.

Having stayed put for about a week near the friend’s house, and disguised as comics sellers, they enticed Rahul to talk to them, with a promise to give him one more comic book than his friend would. Rahul liked the idea and started talking. But when BBC brought up the topic of interview, he got the jitters and tried to run away. But the lure of comics brought him back. And what transpired between BBC and Rahul is as follows.

BBC : Sir, we desperately want to interview you sir, please.

Rahul : But I have not applied for any job with BBC. So why do you want to?

BBC : Not a job interview sir, but…but…an interview…we ask you questions and you answer.

Rahul : What do you mean? Is this an exam or what?

BBC : No sir. It is not an exam. There won’t be a question paper and we don’t publish the result. It is oral. You just have to answer a few questions.

Rahul : How many?

BBC : Maybe about two dozen of them.

Rahul : No way. I have not answered more than five questions at a time ever, even in exams, out of the given twenty. So I will answer five.

BBC : Ok sir…. but please sir, we will cut it down to twenty.

Rahul : Six.

BBC : Fifteen.

Rahul : Eight.

BBC : Ten

Rahul : Done.

BBC : Sir, we will start recording now. Are you ready sir?

“YAY! 0 questions left”

Rahul : What do you mean? Why do you have to record it? Anyway one question down.

BBC : To show it on television sir.

Rahul : You mean I will be shown on TV?! Whoa!

BBC : Yes sir. Just like you came on TV some time ago, on Times Now.

Rahul : Oh No! No way am I going to do this interview. I am leaving.

(Saying this, Rahul bolted. BBC crew ran after him.)

BBC : Sir, Sir…it is not that. We are from BBC…not Times Now.

Rahul : Is Arnab Goswami around? Then I am going.

BBC : No sir. He is not there. He does not work for us. He does not work for anybody. In fact he does not work at all.

Rahul : You are right. He only plays games with people. But where is he?

BBC : Don’t worry sir, he is miles away. We won’t let him harm you. Can we start?

Rahul : Thanks. You can start. That was the second question. Eight left.

BBC : Why did you lose sir?

Rahul : Who said I lost? I always score the highest in all games. Ask my friends if you want. I am the top scorer in Temple Run. I have reached the highest level in Angry Birds. I scored a century in Book Cricket. I lose only in Tic-Tac-Toe.

BBC : Not that sir. Why did you lose in the Loksabha election?

Rahul : Oh! You mean the election. I did not lose. I won the election…..I think….that is what they told me. In fact Smriti Irani congratulated me. And so did many others.

BBC : Sorry sir, not you. Why did Congress lose the election?

Rahul : Oh okay…I too though about it. Quite a bit. I asked several people. And I found out the reason. It is because we did not get enough votes. Other candidates won. That is why we lost.

BBC : Then, why did you get lesser votes than others?

Rahul : It is my mistake. I lied to the people of India. I misled them. That is why they did not vote us.

BBC : Oh! So honest of you sir. What lie did you tell them?

Rahul : I kept telling them that there are six bills pending in the parliament, on important issues like women empowerment. In fact there were only four. That is the mistake I made. And the party had to pay for it.

BBC : But some say your family’s tight control on all affairs affected the party’s chances in the election. What do you think?

Rahul : That is not true. Ours is a great family. The Gandhi family. We all belong to the Gandhi family. Me, my sister, my mother, jijaji…all of us. Except our grandfather Jawaharlal. He was the only exception. I don’t know why he did not belong to our family. He belonged to the Nehru family. Our family is so great and so respected that Bapuji, the father of the nation himself adopted our family name and called himself Mohandas Gandhi. Anyway, you have two questions left.

BBC : Sir.but what about Robert Vadra that belongs to your family? Land deals.…?

Rahul : Sorry. I can’t answer that. Mummy has told me not to speak about jijaji, that too with strangers, even if they offer comic books. Last question!

BBC : Sir, some people say you are on vacation. When will you get back to work?

Rahul : Good question. Now that this interview is over, I have nothing to fear. I will immediately go back. Now, give me my comics.

BBC returned a happy team, for they could ultimately interview Rahul Gandhi. However, trouble started after that. After viewing the preview of the interview, and obviously embarrassed, the Congress said the interviewee was not Rahul at all. They accused BBC of using Rahul’s dummy in order to project Rahul as a dunce, at the behest of BJP, and demanded that the telecast of the interview be banned.

On the other hand, the Indian government felt the interview would show India and Indian politicians in poor light and sought to ban the telecast. BBC, first upset with a second ban on its program in just a couple of weeks, referred the matter to its own review committee. The committee was aghast at the content of the interview and readily supported the ban and decided not to air it in any part of the world.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rahul_Gandhi_360x270_rg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"BBC tracks down Rahul Gandhi for interview, India and BBC both ban the telecast",,1426502149.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,"Faking News has found out that at least 5 miniseries did order a snoop on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for various reasons that could benefit different sections of the society. Here they are:

1. HRD Ministry: HRD ministry confirms that they ordered snooping on Rahul Gandhi as they were in the process to design the perfect curriculum for kindergarten kids. “We wanted to observe what is it that young minds of this country like and prefer, and who better than youth icon Rahul Gandhi himself to study and understand young minds,” confirmed a source from HRD ministry.

2. Finance Ministry: With India struggling to get its act together after economic slowdown, finance ministry was keen to understand how a man with virtually no work and zero income take so many holidays and enjoy so much. “We would then make use of the information thus gathered for under privileged people of the country,” said a close aide of FM, “Poverty truly is a state of mind.”

Jumping the hurdles with elan.

3. Sports Ministry: “We were amazed to see at how well Rahul Gandhi crosses hurdles in his path (pics attached). We certainly see a future Olympic gold medalist in him,” Sports Minister revealed why he wanted to snoop on Rahul.

Always taking the path less traveled.

4. Health Ministry: “How could a person look so stress free even during worst of adversities. How could a person afford a smile when the party he is the VP of faces defeat after defeat? Also how could someone remain youth even after crossing 45 years of age. We certainly want to know the secret,” stated a press release from Health Ministry.

“Is he for real?” wondered Health Minsiter

5. Ministry of Corporate Affairs: Many aspiring to be CEOs had written a letter to the ministry wanting to know the secret of how somebody can keep on getting promotions in his job without doing anything.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/26ph-t140906z2138041784gm1ea2q1ph201rtrmadp3india.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,5 ministries that snooped on Rahul Gandhi and their reasons,,1426499535.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/haryana-govt-forms-committee-to-find-a-department-where-likes-of-khemka-can-be-safely-transferred-7783,"New Delhi. To put an end to the trouble faced by honest IAS officers in the country and their state, Haryana Govt has today decided to find a department where likes of Ashok Khemka can be safely transferred.

The decision was taken after Khemka was transferred yet again to archaeology department.

Fearing they may have to again take out time to decide where to transfer him in 1 or 2 weeks, Haryana govt has once and for all decided to address root cause of their the problem.

No department for honest IAS men.

“We have formed a committee headed by some ex-IAS officers, who for the first few weeks will look if at all there is a department, where work done by honest IAS officers doesn’t threaten our their life in any way,” said a top minister from BJP govt in Haryana.

“If they can’t come up with one, we will then invent one such department, where IAS officers aren’t burdened with the workload of bringing out corruption and reforms. We have certain political parties to take care of that,” he added.

“Also if we don’t address this problem now, soon we will run out of places and departments to transfer Khemka. We can’t send him to same department again, that will hardly be challenging for him as a passionate IAS officer,” he conclude, how steps taken by govt were in the best interests of Kehmka.

Haryana govt further rubbished allegations that the govt was doing nothing to protect whistle-blowers in the state.

“It’s bullshit and baseless. We are well aware that too much of whistle blowing is hazardous to one’s health, and that it can cause asthma attack. It is out of this concern only for the well being of our IAS officers, that we are taking such steps,” said Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar.

Congress govt in Karnataka too has given thumbs up to the decision and promised to assist Haryana govt in their find.

“We must keep political ideologies apart and promote such good initiatives wholeheartedly,” said the Karnataka CM, who is confident no honest IAS officer will be murdered by Mafia, once such a department is in place.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,"Patna. Immediately after Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar advised the protesting nurses in his state to not stage hunger strike in the sun as that will make them dark, JDU leader and dark skin enthusiast Sharad Yadav lambasted him for such remarks.

Saying that Parsekar was spreading lies and misconception, Yadav appealed to nurses in Goa to not pay attention to him and carry on with protests.

“To say that having dark skin spoils marital prospects for girls is utter bullshit. Look at Michelle Obama. US president married her,” pointed Sharad Yadav, arguing that he was sure Indian men also thought like him.

“Khabardaar”

Yadav further lashed out at Parsekar for playing a spoilsport at what was a golden opportunity to do ‘Rang Wapsi’ of some Indian women.

“This was in fact blessing in disguise, that nurses without caring about what will happen to their skin, went under sun to protest, and this man by reminding them of their complexion just spoiled the party,” Yadav said angrily.

“Out here in Bihar, we deliberately don’t fulfill wishes and demands of female section of the society, so that they are forced to protest under sun and get dark complexioned, thereby becoming dusky beauties. This BJP leader ought to learn from us,” the JDU leader said, once again justifying how their break up from NDA was indeed a right decision.

Sharad Yadav now intends to gatecrash into Goa assembly and debate with Goa CM and his MLAs about skin color of women in India, and how steps should be taken to ensure dark skinned women don’t become extinct.

“The only positive part about Parsekar’s statement is that there is at least one politician in this country who thinks that complexion is very much a debatable topic and much more important than corruption or any other issue,” Yadav said as he left for Goa.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thumb.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,Sharad Yadav blasts Goa CM for advising Nurses against getting dark,,1427874333.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg who earlier today alleged that he received fake calls in the name of Arun Jaitely and Nitin Gadkari, asking him to support BJP few months back, claims that he smelled rat when one of the callers on the phone identified himself as Manmohan Singh.

As per Garg, after Kejriwal ordered calls to be made to him and other MLAs to show BJP was indulging in horse trading and poaching, he, in order to maintain neutrality, also asked his aide cum loyalist Sanjay Singh to get few fake calls made from Congress representatives as well.

Garg laughed his ass out, when caller identified himself as Manmohan

But AAP members being AAP members, of all the leaders in Congress, they chose Manmohan’s name, which made Rajesh suspicious and he knew it was a hoax.

“Truth be told, initially I was stunned and honored to be the first person to whom Manmohan sir has chose to speak to. But as the realization dawned, I knew this can’t be true,” the former MLA from Rohini disclosed to the Faking News reporter.

“There was no Theek Hai, no words about Rahul Gandhi ji’s leadership, I mean that’s not the Manmohan this world or I know,” he further argued.

“Also do you really think a person who did open his mouth for 10 years, when he was PM, would do so when he is not one anymore,” he asked.

Rajesh Garg claims that Kejriwal and the caller knew Mahmohan Singh’s persona inside out and just tried to take advantage of that.

“Taking Manmohan’s name was safest option for them, as knowing him really well, even if the news reached his ears, he would do nothing to counter this allegation,” Rajesh Garg explained.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rajesh-garg-aap-mla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajesh-garg-says-he-smelled-rat-when-calls-were-made-by-aap-in-the-name-of-manmohan-singh-7773,Rajesh Garg says he smelled rat when calls were made by AAP in the name of Manmohan Singh,,1427797827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Ahmedabad. A local Church was heavily damaged by an unknown lightning in the outskirts of this city last night. While police is investigating the matter, activists and some journalists are insisting that Hindutva groups were behind the act.

Around 11 PM last night, a bright lightning was spotted by neighbors of the Church along with a heavy thunder. Within few seconds, there were sounds of glass breaking and security of the Church could sense smoke billowing out of the church.

“Once the smoke started coming out, I rushed to the altar and found that the lightning had cracked the glass windows and burnt a few wooden benches. I doused the fire immediately and then called the police,” a security guard at the Church told this reporter.

CCTV capture of lightning entering the church to attack it. Police is unable to nab the lightning even with such clear proofs. This proves that minorities are not safe in India.

However, some groups believe that the police shouldn’t rule out a foul play. Speaking to Faking News, Robert Salvo, an ex-IAS officer, said, “We asked for rains so that farmers benefit, but Modi’s India is sending lightning down our churches and thunders down our hearts. I feel like I’m on a hitlist.”

One expert has cleared doubts that had been clouding over the clouds and have squarely blamed Modi and RSS as responsible for the attacks.

“This is nothing but a very long conspiracy by the Hindutva groups. Cloud seeding technique is not new, and these groups are known to be tech savvy. It will be shame if police doesn’t investigate this angle,” Darana Ayub, an investigative journalist said.

Mr. Ayub also wrote an article on how minorities were being targeted by accidents, fire, storm, and earthquakes in Modi’s India.

“You can’t blame external factors like clouds and rains. It is a homegrown monster. We should open our eyes and see the threat. Modi had quoted ‘where the head is held high’ to Christians last month and now, can we hold our head high and face the sky during rain or lightning? Modi must answer this,” the article said.

Activists have also expressed unhappiness over the direction in which investigation was moving.

“Police is asking the Church to setup lightning arrestors to prevent such incidents in future. Why is the police asking us to arrest lightning? Can’t they do it?” an activist protested.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tumblr_nfhx10ow2c1r7u6l5o1_1280.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Lightning strikes a Church in Gujarat, Hindutva groups alleged to be behind it",,1427792777.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Mumbai: ‘Manoranjan ka Baap’ – IPL has met its real daddy, the Aam Aadmi Party. Internal fight among AAP cadres is driving the TRP’s of news channels so high that BCCI is considering postponing IPL-8 till either the political entertainment stops or viewers get bored of it and start demanding change.

According to the sources, it is the first time that IPL is feeling competition from any other source of entertainment. Neither Bollywood movies nor LS elections (2009/2014) ever posed any threat to IPL before.

Full on entertainment.

“When the ruckus started in early March we thought that it will cover for a rather dull Cricket world cup and then by the time country gets ready for IPL, AAP will manage to douse the fire and people will shift focus on Cricket. But new stings just keep coming out of nowhere and neither News channels nor people are ready to give us any attention. If we don’t get any TRP there is no point conducting it,” explained a forever poker faced IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla.

“Does it mean IPL is losing its relevance in the fascist regime that is prevailing in the country lately?” Shaitaan Khopdi™ tried do a Sagarika Ghose, to which Rajiv Shukla replied, “IPL means entertainment. When there is enough of it available 24×7, why would people watch our matches that last only 4 hours?”

Shaitaan Khopdi™ argued, “But IPL’s main objective was to provide international exposure to domestic players and overall betterment of Cricket in India, BCCI should go ahead with the schedule without worrying about TRP.” However Shukla explained that it was just a ‘Jumla’ and should not be taken seriously.

Shukla was then asked, “Does BCCI have a plan if the AAP entertainment refuses to stop?”

“We have created a ‘Mauka’ type ad where we insert ‘Cricket’ in political news to remind people that they are supposed to watch IPL during March-April. This will be played during prime time Ad breaks on news channels in Ravi Shastri’s voice,” Shukla replied.

“It goes like this: Right at the start of ‘Power-Play’, AAP captain gets ‘Retired Hurt’ and goes Bangalore to get ‘Just what the doctor ordered’. Right then, experienced bowlers Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan overstep the line, giving Vice-captain Sisodia free-hits. He gladly hits both like ‘A tracer bullet’ for the ‘Yes Bank Maximum’. During the ‘Strategic Time out’ stump microphone picks up a conversation which exposes that AK rigged the auctions by trying to fix 6 players that were retained by Congress. Delhi immediately asks for a review against this ‘Karbonn Kamaal Catch’. Election Commission informs that Delhi has already lost their review on 7th Feb and next review will be available only in 2020,” Shukla revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-yogendra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Fearing low TRPs, BCCI postpones IPL-8 till AAP infighting stops",,1427715318.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With growing need to address frequent Press Conferences every now and then, senior leader of AAP, Yogendra Yadav has decided to open an in house Press Club at his residence in Rewari.

Henceforth all his Press Conferences will be held at this Press Club.

“Of late, the need for having a Press Club in my house has become even more important than having a washroom. I do more PCs in a day than the number of times I go to my washroom,” Yogendra Yadav explained, confirming the development. “Now I will do PCs as and when I want.”

Yogendra Yadav’s last PC outside residence.

Yogendra Yadav further argued Kejriwal had a clear advantage over him when it comes to addressing Press Conferences because of the fact that he is based out of Delhi.

“And by the time I reach Delhi or Gurgaon from here, Kejriwal camp already does 3-4 PCs and I again have to do catching up. I am already lagging behind them, and have to cover it up and maintain a healthy lead over them quickly,” revealed Yogendra.

“Me and Bhushan ji can ill afford to waste time in transit,” he added.

Over and above opening a Press Club, the psephologist turned politician has also decided to hire a Media Manager for managing these conferences.

“Not only this, it would be nicer if some of those news channels and media outlets permanently send their reporters and camera person on an onsite duty to my residence. This will help in quick dissemination of the news,” Yogendra Yadav told Faking News, assuring a separate space for them as well at his residence.

Meanwhile Kejriwal camp has decided to raise questions in their next PC over the source from where Yogendra Yadav camp is getting money to construct Press Club and hire Media managers.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yogendra-yadav-prashant-bhushan_650x400_61427552245.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/yogendra-yadav-to-open-a-mini-press-club-at-his-residence-for-quick-press-confrerences-7760,Yogendra Yadav to open a mini press club at his residence for quick Press Confrerences,,1427700435.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Faking News has been able to acquire a full transcript of what really went on inside the AAP National Executive (NE) meet yesterday. We can verify the authenticity of this transcript as this was purchased directly from the members of AAPs official sting making body, which is known as KAC (Khufia Affairs Committee). Below is the full, original, unedited, and uncensored* transcript, for your enlightenment:

– Scene: Around 350 unshaven, sweaty, slightly obese men sitting around a table discussing burning issues that impact the aam admi today, like India’s exit from the World Cup and who would win the IPL. Certain MLAs could also be seen betting money even as Prasant Bhusan protested against unethical activities like cricket betting. Amidst the general din, Arvind Kejriwal stands up to begin his inaugural speech –

Arvind Kejriwal (AK): Upasthit sabhya aur asabhya mahoday, I thank you all for coming, and Admiral Ramdas for not coming, to this momentous occasion. I would like to start by saying how deeply hurt I am seeing all the muck being thrown around among party members in the past few weeks. I went to Bengaluru to get toxins removed from my system, however I fear with so much toxicity surrounding me, no natural or supernatural cure can come to my aide.

– Ashutosh is seeing trying to hold back his tears, Mayank Gandhi typing away a new blog on his laptop –

AK continues: You know, I formed this party to fight against corrupt people like Gadkari, Modi, and Arnab. But I can’t fight against my own colleagues. It is against my principles and sensibilities. Hence I believe it would be best to kick them out.

– Abruptly, he starts singing, horribly out of tune, the song ‘In The End’ by Linkin Park, to show his state of mind. Most members put on earphones, while Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan , Manish Sisodia and a few others start singing along –

AK: I can live with many things, be it chronic coughs, itchy mufflers, cold Delhi footpaths, or African women, but betrayal of trust is the one thing I can not accept. You must choose now between me or the rebels. I would want a fair voting, hence I state beforehand that anyone voting against me would face no discrimination. Though in my meeting earlier with Dalai Lama, I requested a handful of Shaolin Monks from him, in case I need to ‘control’ people indulging in ‘anti party activities’. Now if you would excuse me I have an urgent appointment with Azam Khan regarding the plight of aam buffaloes in India.

– AK stands up to exit the scene. Prashant Bhushan stands up with great alarm –

Prashant Bhushan (PB): You gaddar! We raised you, trained you! Made you who you are today! Without us you are nothing! You can’t kick us out without a fight! We want a trial by combat!

– PB picks up a chair and charges towards AK. Suddenly, two burly men appear from nowhere and promptly puts PB in his place. The men are revealed to be Jason Momoa and Dwane Jonson –

Yadav happy to come out of the meet without any injuries

Yogendra Yadav (YY) – visibly shaken – : W..who are these people?!

Manish Sisodia (MS) : They are members of the NE.

YY: What? But I’ve never seen them before!

MS: They are temporary members.. like, only for today.

PB – struggling to get up – : This is blasphemy! A murder of democracy! You are acting like the dark lord Sauron!

MS: Whatever. Enough of this shit! I propose that we kick these two, along with a few of their helpers, out of the NE. All those in favour raise their hands.

YY: Discussion! We want a discussion!!

Gopal Rai: Sure. Give us in writing. Make sure it’s at least 1000 words or more. Plus you get extra marks for judicious use of quotes and allegories.

– Meanwhile the count of hands continues. Some members, like Sisodia and Ashustosh can be seen putting up both hands –

PB: Now WTF is this!? Why are they allowed to put up both hands?!

Ashutosh: Why should we discriminate between both our hands? Do you mean to say one hand has more rights than the other? Is this the swaraj you believe in?

-Vote counting ends –

MS: 280 votes in favour, 8 votes against. Damn, this is like an India Pakistan WC match, not even close. LOL!

YY: This is all pre scripted. The drama being played out here seems to be written by Ekta Kapoor!

Gopal Rai: These are serious allegations. Do you have any proof?

YY: Proof?! You need more proof?! Why was our internal lokpal not allowed to attend the proceedings?

GR: Oh that’s simple. His term is coming to an end, so we decided to hire a new lokpal. In fact we have him here with us today. Please come in – gestures towards the door –

– To the visible shock and dismay of the rebels, ACP Pradyuman enters the hall. At this moment, the YY and PB camp realises the hopelessness of the situation and decides to make a hasty retreat –

In another letter leaked from AAP, albeit this time not from Prashant Bhushan, it has been found that AAP supreme Arvind Kejriwal thanked Indian captain MS Dhoni and Times Now for helping shift focus away from massive internal war within AAP yesterday.

Worried that the most massive showdown within AAP would be hogging headlines everywhere on Prime time, Kejriwal was relieved to find ace anchor Arnab Goswami debating about India’s defeat in semi-final match against Australia instead for one hour.

Extending an olive branch to Arnab

“I was wrong about Arnab ji all along. He is not anti-AAP and certainly not anybody’s agent,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

He further told us how pleasantly shocked he was to see no media person question him about those sting tapes, ever since he returned from Bangalore.

“So somewhere I had this feeling even this thing will not get coverage from Media, but the massiveness of the rift had me in two minds and I thought maybe they will,” Kejriwal confessed.

“Also I thought this time now that India has lost and these channels would have nothing else to discuss about cricket further and they would certainly shift focus to us. But thanks to Arnab and Times Now for setting the narrative and shifting focus from us,” Kejriwal added.

When asked why did he thank Dhoni in his letter, Kejriwal shot back, “Do you really think had it not been for his effort and conduct in the world cup, Indians would have got united in standing behind him?”

Kejriwal further expressed satisfaction over no trend related to AAP hogging limelight on Twitter with #ShameonTimesNow attracting attention of one and all.

So much so that AAP volunteers did not even bother to trend stuff like #AKweAreWithYou #OpportunistBhushanYadav or any other such hashtag on Twitter to show their solidarity.

“This time supporters from all political parties were united in going after Times Now,” Kejriwal said, ““sab actually mein mile hue the ji.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-kejriwal-2014-pictures.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-writes-a-thank-you-letter-to-dhoni-and-times-now-for-shifting-focus-off-aaps-massive-internal-war-7743,Kejriwal writes a thank you letter to Dhoni and Times Now for shifting focus off AAP's massive internal war,,1427444021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Bengaluru: Aam Aadmi Party chief and Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, was in the city for treatment for Jindal Hospital. While unreliable sources reveal that he went there for medical treatment, trusted sources reveal that he was there for some other reason.

Highly placed sources, who were in terrace of hospital, passed us several interesting information about stay of Kejriwal there. One such source said, “Kejriwal came here on first week of March along with his parents and was staying here for the past two weeks. The news reports and even the hospital’s medical bulletin reveals that Kejriwal came to Jindal hospital for sugar treatment. But, it is all fabrications. The truth is, Kejriwal checked in here to learn ‘Sign Language’. The photos that they display in newspapers of Kejriwal doing stuffs here is nothing but learning the sign language.”

When we asked about the reason for Sign Learning, another source, which was standing next to our primary source, said, “Kejriwalji is wary of getting caught in stings. He is now scared of each and every AAP volunteer and member. He is avoiding to talk in mobile phones nowadays. He is asking for thorough check of people visiting him. But, how many days can he continue like this? So, he has decided to learn sign language and will be using that sign language to communicate with people who will meet him in future. He is said to have told his tutor that ‘Henceforth I will sign and sign, but not resign’.”

Our Faking News team along with experts have deciphered the step-by-step training given to Kejriwal in Jindal’s hospital here. Our sources affirm that Kejriwal will discuss with anyone who comes to meet him only using these signs:

First, nose is being fine tuned to catch any ‘sting’ probability. This medicine can help Kejriwal find out anyone with camera or recorder by its smell. If found, Kejriwal will show the door(refer the 6th pic)

After the smelling part, then the sign language will start. This sign is to denote the person that “Let the discussion flow, but I will not hear a single word of it”. This means he is not interested to hear him. Will be used for party dissenters.

This sign is to persuade the person to stretch the limits of the discussion & look beyond what is in hands, i.e., announce freebies and look at Modi’s hands for funds.

This sign will be used to denote the person that the discussion is more Left than Right. Now, the direction of discussion will turn from Left to somewhat Right.

This is to bring the topic back from Right to Left. See how the Left Knee is bent upwards to symbolize that Left. The usage of alternate hand-leg is to stress the alternate form of politics that he practices.

This is ‘showing the door’ to the person, if Kejriwal is not happy with the discussion. The person should immediately leave.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/0sL1Z-6.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Kejriwal went to Bangalore to learn Sign Language, to escape future stings: Sources",,1426920872.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-to-launch-dark-and-lovely-cream-in-indian-market-to-apply-on-fair-skinned-female-mps-first-7656,"New Delhi. Renowned female complexion expert and women body enthusiast Sharad Yadav has today announced launch of ‘Dark and lovely’ skin cream in Indian market.

Sad that nobody decided to take him seriously in the parliament and instead wanted to focus on trivial things like FDI in insurance sector, Yadav chose to take this path to get his thoughts across.

The product however already exists in African market and makers of the same approached Yadav, impressed with his conviction and how he stood by his thoughts for two consecutive sessions in Rajya Sabha.

“Farak dekhiye sirf 5 din mein”

“For years, we were confused as to how we can infiltrate the Indian market as people there are perpetually fairness obsessed. But in Mr Sharad, we found the right brand ambassador for our product and feel he can do wonders in India where even South Indians don’t respect their own skin colour as much as he does,” said spokesperson of ‘Dark and Lovely’ from South Africa.

Immediately after launching the cream, the JDU MP will carry the first tube with him in the Rajya Sabha and apply on the faces of fair skinned women MPs in the parliament.

“I want to end skin color discrimination in this country and what better place to start this noble act than my own workplace,” Sharad Yadav told Faking News, “I will ensure we have no fair skinned MP left in the parliament.”

Yadav further said that he was ready to listen to counter remarks in the debate session, provided they come from dusky complexioned colleagues and thus by applying this cream he was only ensuring that he isn’t compelled to say “I know what you are” again in the parliament.

“Pehle aap apni twacha mere se baat karne ke kaabil banaiye, fir munh kholiye,” declared the dark skin aficionado cum politician, taking a potshot at BJP MP Smriti Irani.

Yadav however rued that he could not do much about the shape of MPs bodies in such a short span of time, but is hopeful of launching a product for that too soon.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sharad-yadav.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-to-launch-dark-and-lovely-cream-in-indian-market-to-apply-on-fair-skinned-female-mps-first-7656,"Sharad Yadav to launch 'Dark and Lovely' cream in Indian market, to apply on fair skinned female MPs first",,1426578989.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"New Delhi: Several questions that have been dogging the minds of Indians for some time have been answered now. Why did Rahul Gandhi vanish? Where is he hiding? How to find him? Why did Congress lose Loksabha elections? And such.

A few days ago, BBC sent out a request to Rahul Gandhi for an interview. That is when Rahul went missing. Dreading the prospect of having to face an interview, he went underground, which has been described variously by the Congress leaders as vacation, winding down, soul searching, meditation, chilling, rejuvenating, brain(?)storming, strategizing, etc. But the fact has been established – Rahul is hiding from BBC. ‘Was hiding’, one should say, because BBC finally found him. One of the Indian journalists who was part of the BBC team related the story in depth, as below.

Two weeks ago, BBC approached Rahul Gandhi through his office, asking for an interview on important matters. The very term ‘important matters’ sent shivers down his spine and he declined to participate. However, BBC doggedly continued their pursuit. When they called him up directly on his personal number, he first did not pick up the calls. Then he said they had reached a wrong number. Then he said he was a different Rahul Gandhi. Then he spoke in a lady’s voice and told BBC that Rahul was out of office.

When he tried the same trick many times, BBC told him that they knew he was lying because they could see him in the office as they too were there. Rahul claimed to have forgotten where he was and told BBC he would meet them in a while. That was the last any one saw or heard of him.

Having waited in Rahul’s office for several days, BBC, in a desperate bid, took the help of a veteran Congress leader and one-man expert committee on Rahul Gandhi affairs, Shankar Iyer Mani (name changed to protect identity). They learnt that come what may, Rahul meets a childhood friend at least once a week, to exchange comics.

Having stayed put for about a week near the friend’s house, and disguised as comics sellers, they enticed Rahul to talk to them, with a promise to give him one more comic book than his friend would. Rahul liked the idea and started talking. But when BBC brought up the topic of interview, he got the jitters and tried to run away. But the lure of comics brought him back. And what transpired between BBC and Rahul is as follows.

BBC : Sir, we desperately want to interview you sir, please.

Rahul : But I have not applied for any job with BBC. So why do you want to?

BBC : Not a job interview sir, but…but…an interview…we ask you questions and you answer.

Rahul : What do you mean? Is this an exam or what?

BBC : No sir. It is not an exam. There won’t be a question paper and we don’t publish the result. It is oral. You just have to answer a few questions.

Rahul : How many?

BBC : Maybe about two dozen of them.

Rahul : No way. I have not answered more than five questions at a time ever, even in exams, out of the given twenty. So I will answer five.

BBC : Ok sir…. but please sir, we will cut it down to twenty.

Rahul : Six.

BBC : Fifteen.

Rahul : Eight.

BBC : Ten

Rahul : Done.

BBC : Sir, we will start recording now. Are you ready sir?

“YAY! 0 questions left”

Rahul : What do you mean? Why do you have to record it? Anyway one question down.

BBC : To show it on television sir.

Rahul : You mean I will be shown on TV?! Whoa!

BBC : Yes sir. Just like you came on TV some time ago, on Times Now.

Rahul : Oh No! No way am I going to do this interview. I am leaving.

(Saying this, Rahul bolted. BBC crew ran after him.)

BBC : Sir, Sir…it is not that. We are from BBC…not Times Now.

Rahul : Is Arnab Goswami around? Then I am going.

BBC : No sir. He is not there. He does not work for us. He does not work for anybody. In fact he does not work at all.

Rahul : You are right. He only plays games with people. But where is he?

BBC : Don’t worry sir, he is miles away. We won’t let him harm you. Can we start?

Rahul : Thanks. You can start. That was the second question. Eight left.

BBC : Why did you lose sir?

Rahul : Who said I lost? I always score the highest in all games. Ask my friends if you want. I am the top scorer in Temple Run. I have reached the highest level in Angry Birds. I scored a century in Book Cricket. I lose only in Tic-Tac-Toe.

BBC : Not that sir. Why did you lose in the Loksabha election?

Rahul : Oh! You mean the election. I did not lose. I won the election…..I think….that is what they told me. In fact Smriti Irani congratulated me. And so did many others.

BBC : Sorry sir, not you. Why did Congress lose the election?

Rahul : Oh okay…I too though about it. Quite a bit. I asked several people. And I found out the reason. It is because we did not get enough votes. Other candidates won. That is why we lost.

BBC : Then, why did you get lesser votes than others?

Rahul : It is my mistake. I lied to the people of India. I misled them. That is why they did not vote us.

BBC : Oh! So honest of you sir. What lie did you tell them?

Rahul : I kept telling them that there are six bills pending in the parliament, on important issues like women empowerment. In fact there were only four. That is the mistake I made. And the party had to pay for it.

BBC : But some say your family’s tight control on all affairs affected the party’s chances in the election. What do you think?

Rahul : That is not true. Ours is a great family. The Gandhi family. We all belong to the Gandhi family. Me, my sister, my mother, jijaji…all of us. Except our grandfather Jawaharlal. He was the only exception. I don’t know why he did not belong to our family. He belonged to the Nehru family. Our family is so great and so respected that Bapuji, the father of the nation himself adopted our family name and called himself Mohandas Gandhi. Anyway, you have two questions left.

BBC : Sir.but what about Robert Vadra that belongs to your family? Land deals.…?

Rahul : Sorry. I can’t answer that. Mummy has told me not to speak about jijaji, that too with strangers, even if they offer comic books. Last question!

BBC : Sir, some people say you are on vacation. When will you get back to work?

Rahul : Good question. Now that this interview is over, I have nothing to fear. I will immediately go back. Now, give me my comics.

BBC returned a happy team, for they could ultimately interview Rahul Gandhi. However, trouble started after that. After viewing the preview of the interview, and obviously embarrassed, the Congress said the interviewee was not Rahul at all. They accused BBC of using Rahul’s dummy in order to project Rahul as a dunce, at the behest of BJP, and demanded that the telecast of the interview be banned.

On the other hand, the Indian government felt the interview would show India and Indian politicians in poor light and sought to ban the telecast. BBC, first upset with a second ban on its program in just a couple of weeks, referred the matter to its own review committee. The committee was aghast at the content of the interview and readily supported the ban and decided not to air it in any part of the world.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rahul_Gandhi_360x270_rg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"BBC tracks down Rahul Gandhi for interview, India and BBC both ban the telecast",,1426502149.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,"Faking News has found out that at least 5 miniseries did order a snoop on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for various reasons that could benefit different sections of the society. Here they are:

1. HRD Ministry: HRD ministry confirms that they ordered snooping on Rahul Gandhi as they were in the process to design the perfect curriculum for kindergarten kids. “We wanted to observe what is it that young minds of this country like and prefer, and who better than youth icon Rahul Gandhi himself to study and understand young minds,” confirmed a source from HRD ministry.

2. Finance Ministry: With India struggling to get its act together after economic slowdown, finance ministry was keen to understand how a man with virtually no work and zero income take so many holidays and enjoy so much. “We would then make use of the information thus gathered for under privileged people of the country,” said a close aide of FM, “Poverty truly is a state of mind.”

Jumping the hurdles with elan.

3. Sports Ministry: “We were amazed to see at how well Rahul Gandhi crosses hurdles in his path (pics attached). We certainly see a future Olympic gold medalist in him,” Sports Minister revealed why he wanted to snoop on Rahul.

Always taking the path less traveled.

4. Health Ministry: “How could a person look so stress free even during worst of adversities. How could a person afford a smile when the party he is the VP of faces defeat after defeat? Also how could someone remain youth even after crossing 45 years of age. We certainly want to know the secret,” stated a press release from Health Ministry.

“Is he for real?” wondered Health Minsiter

5. Ministry of Corporate Affairs: Many aspiring to be CEOs had written a letter to the ministry wanting to know the secret of how somebody can keep on getting promotions in his job without doing anything.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/26ph-t140906z2138041784gm1ea2q1ph201rtrmadp3india.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,5 ministries that snooped on Rahul Gandhi and their reasons,,1426499535.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/haryana-govt-forms-committee-to-find-a-department-where-likes-of-khemka-can-be-safely-transferred-7783,"New Delhi. To put an end to the trouble faced by honest IAS officers in the country and their state, Haryana Govt has today decided to find a department where likes of Ashok Khemka can be safely transferred.

The decision was taken after Khemka was transferred yet again to archaeology department.

Fearing they may have to again take out time to decide where to transfer him in 1 or 2 weeks, Haryana govt has once and for all decided to address root cause of their the problem.

No department for honest IAS men.

“We have formed a committee headed by some ex-IAS officers, who for the first few weeks will look if at all there is a department, where work done by honest IAS officers doesn’t threaten our their life in any way,” said a top minister from BJP govt in Haryana.

“If they can’t come up with one, we will then invent one such department, where IAS officers aren’t burdened with the workload of bringing out corruption and reforms. We have certain political parties to take care of that,” he added.

“Also if we don’t address this problem now, soon we will run out of places and departments to transfer Khemka. We can’t send him to same department again, that will hardly be challenging for him as a passionate IAS officer,” he conclude, how steps taken by govt were in the best interests of Kehmka.

Haryana govt further rubbished allegations that the govt was doing nothing to protect whistle-blowers in the state.

“It’s bullshit and baseless. We are well aware that too much of whistle blowing is hazardous to one’s health, and that it can cause asthma attack. It is out of this concern only for the well being of our IAS officers, that we are taking such steps,” said Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar.

Congress govt in Karnataka too has given thumbs up to the decision and promised to assist Haryana govt in their find.

“We must keep political ideologies apart and promote such good initiatives wholeheartedly,” said the Karnataka CM, who is confident no honest IAS officer will be murdered by Mafia, once such a department is in place.

Meanwhile Khemka has decided to throw away his suitcase once and for all and henceforth will be carrying only 2-3 pair of clothes to his next posting.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bl04_khemka_1417140f.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/haryana-govt-forms-committee-to-find-a-department-where-likes-of-khemka-can-be-safely-transferred-7783,Haryana govt forms committee to find a department where likes of Khemka can be safely transferred,,1427959759.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,"Patna. Immediately after Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar advised the protesting nurses in his state to not stage hunger strike in the sun as that will make them dark, JDU leader and dark skin enthusiast Sharad Yadav lambasted him for such remarks.

Saying that Parsekar was spreading lies and misconception, Yadav appealed to nurses in Goa to not pay attention to him and carry on with protests.

“To say that having dark skin spoils marital prospects for girls is utter bullshit. Look at Michelle Obama. US president married her,” pointed Sharad Yadav, arguing that he was sure Indian men also thought like him.

“Khabardaar”

Yadav further lashed out at Parsekar for playing a spoilsport at what was a golden opportunity to do ‘Rang Wapsi’ of some Indian women.

“This was in fact blessing in disguise, that nurses without caring about what will happen to their skin, went under sun to protest, and this man by reminding them of their complexion just spoiled the party,” Yadav said angrily.

“Out here in Bihar, we deliberately don’t fulfill wishes and demands of female section of the society, so that they are forced to protest under sun and get dark complexioned, thereby becoming dusky beauties. This BJP leader ought to learn from us,” the JDU leader said, once again justifying how their break up from NDA was indeed a right decision.

Sharad Yadav now intends to gatecrash into Goa assembly and debate with Goa CM and his MLAs about skin color of women in India, and how steps should be taken to ensure dark skinned women don’t become extinct.

“The only positive part about Parsekar’s statement is that there is at least one politician in this country who thinks that complexion is very much a debatable topic and much more important than corruption or any other issue,” Yadav said as he left for Goa.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thumb.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-blasts-goa-cm-for-advising-nurses-against-getting-dark-7775,Sharad Yadav blasts Goa CM for advising Nurses against getting dark,,1427874333.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg who earlier today alleged that he received fake calls in the name of Arun Jaitely and Nitin Gadkari, asking him to support BJP few months back, claims that he smelled rat when one of the callers on the phone identified himself as Manmohan Singh.

As per Garg, after Kejriwal ordered calls to be made to him and other MLAs to show BJP was indulging in horse trading and poaching, he, in order to maintain neutrality, also asked his aide cum loyalist Sanjay Singh to get few fake calls made from Congress representatives as well.

Garg laughed his ass out, when caller identified himself as Manmohan

But AAP members being AAP members, of all the leaders in Congress, they chose Manmohan’s name, which made Rajesh suspicious and he knew it was a hoax.

“Truth be told, initially I was stunned and honored to be the first person to whom Manmohan sir has chose to speak to. But as the realization dawned, I knew this can’t be true,” the former MLA from Rohini disclosed to the Faking News reporter.

“There was no Theek Hai, no words about Rahul Gandhi ji’s leadership, I mean that’s not the Manmohan this world or I know,” he further argued.

“Also do you really think a person who did open his mouth for 10 years, when he was PM, would do so when he is not one anymore,” he asked.

Rajesh Garg claims that Kejriwal and the caller knew Mahmohan Singh’s persona inside out and just tried to take advantage of that.

“Taking Manmohan’s name was safest option for them, as knowing him really well, even if the news reached his ears, he would do nothing to counter this allegation,” Rajesh Garg explained.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rajesh-garg-aap-mla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajesh-garg-says-he-smelled-rat-when-calls-were-made-by-aap-in-the-name-of-manmohan-singh-7773,Rajesh Garg says he smelled rat when calls were made by AAP in the name of Manmohan Singh,,1427797827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Ahmedabad. A local Church was heavily damaged by an unknown lightning in the outskirts of this city last night. While police is investigating the matter, activists and some journalists are insisting that Hindutva groups were behind the act.

Around 11 PM last night, a bright lightning was spotted by neighbors of the Church along with a heavy thunder. Within few seconds, there were sounds of glass breaking and security of the Church could sense smoke billowing out of the church.

“Once the smoke started coming out, I rushed to the altar and found that the lightning had cracked the glass windows and burnt a few wooden benches. I doused the fire immediately and then called the police,” a security guard at the Church told this reporter.

CCTV capture of lightning entering the church to attack it. Police is unable to nab the lightning even with such clear proofs. This proves that minorities are not safe in India.

However, some groups believe that the police shouldn’t rule out a foul play. Speaking to Faking News, Robert Salvo, an ex-IAS officer, said, “We asked for rains so that farmers benefit, but Modi’s India is sending lightning down our churches and thunders down our hearts. I feel like I’m on a hitlist.”

One expert has cleared doubts that had been clouding over the clouds and have squarely blamed Modi and RSS as responsible for the attacks.

“This is nothing but a very long conspiracy by the Hindutva groups. Cloud seeding technique is not new, and these groups are known to be tech savvy. It will be shame if police doesn’t investigate this angle,” Darana Ayub, an investigative journalist said.

Mr. Ayub also wrote an article on how minorities were being targeted by accidents, fire, storm, and earthquakes in Modi’s India.

“You can’t blame external factors like clouds and rains. It is a homegrown monster. We should open our eyes and see the threat. Modi had quoted ‘where the head is held high’ to Christians last month and now, can we hold our head high and face the sky during rain or lightning? Modi must answer this,” the article said.

Activists have also expressed unhappiness over the direction in which investigation was moving.

“Police is asking the Church to setup lightning arrestors to prevent such incidents in future. Why is the police asking us to arrest lightning? Can’t they do it?” an activist protested.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tumblr_nfhx10ow2c1r7u6l5o1_1280.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lightning-strikes-a-church-in-gujarat-hindutva-groups-alleged-to-be-behind-it-7771,"Lightning strikes a Church in Gujarat, Hindutva groups alleged to be behind it",,1427792777.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Mumbai: ‘Manoranjan ka Baap’ – IPL has met its real daddy, the Aam Aadmi Party. Internal fight among AAP cadres is driving the TRP’s of news channels so high that BCCI is considering postponing IPL-8 till either the political entertainment stops or viewers get bored of it and start demanding change.

According to the sources, it is the first time that IPL is feeling competition from any other source of entertainment. Neither Bollywood movies nor LS elections (2009/2014) ever posed any threat to IPL before.

Full on entertainment.

“When the ruckus started in early March we thought that it will cover for a rather dull Cricket world cup and then by the time country gets ready for IPL, AAP will manage to douse the fire and people will shift focus on Cricket. But new stings just keep coming out of nowhere and neither News channels nor people are ready to give us any attention. If we don’t get any TRP there is no point conducting it,” explained a forever poker faced IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla.

“Does it mean IPL is losing its relevance in the fascist regime that is prevailing in the country lately?” Shaitaan Khopdi™ tried do a Sagarika Ghose, to which Rajiv Shukla replied, “IPL means entertainment. When there is enough of it available 24×7, why would people watch our matches that last only 4 hours?”

Shaitaan Khopdi™ argued, “But IPL’s main objective was to provide international exposure to domestic players and overall betterment of Cricket in India, BCCI should go ahead with the schedule without worrying about TRP.” However Shukla explained that it was just a ‘Jumla’ and should not be taken seriously.

Shukla was then asked, “Does BCCI have a plan if the AAP entertainment refuses to stop?”

“We have created a ‘Mauka’ type ad where we insert ‘Cricket’ in political news to remind people that they are supposed to watch IPL during March-April. This will be played during prime time Ad breaks on news channels in Ravi Shastri’s voice,” Shukla replied.

“It goes like this: Right at the start of ‘Power-Play’, AAP captain gets ‘Retired Hurt’ and goes Bangalore to get ‘Just what the doctor ordered’. Right then, experienced bowlers Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan overstep the line, giving Vice-captain Sisodia free-hits. He gladly hits both like ‘A tracer bullet’ for the ‘Yes Bank Maximum’. During the ‘Strategic Time out’ stump microphone picks up a conversation which exposes that AK rigged the auctions by trying to fix 6 players that were retained by Congress. Delhi immediately asks for a review against this ‘Karbonn Kamaal Catch’. Election Commission informs that Delhi has already lost their review on 7th Feb and next review will be available only in 2020,” Shukla revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-yogendra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fearing-low-trps-bcci-postpones-ipl-8-till-aap-infighting-stops-7766,"Fearing low TRPs, BCCI postpones IPL-8 till AAP infighting stops",,1427715318.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With growing need to address frequent Press Conferences every now and then, senior leader of AAP, Yogendra Yadav has decided to open an in house Press Club at his residence in Rewari.

Henceforth all his Press Conferences will be held at this Press Club.

“Of late, the need for having a Press Club in my house has become even more important than having a washroom. I do more PCs in a day than the number of times I go to my washroom,” Yogendra Yadav explained, confirming the development. “Now I will do PCs as and when I want.”

Yogendra Yadav’s last PC outside residence.

Yogendra Yadav further argued Kejriwal had a clear advantage over him when it comes to addressing Press Conferences because of the fact that he is based out of Delhi.

“And by the time I reach Delhi or Gurgaon from here, Kejriwal camp already does 3-4 PCs and I again have to do catching up. I am already lagging behind them, and have to cover it up and maintain a healthy lead over them quickly,” revealed Yogendra.

“Me and Bhushan ji can ill afford to waste time in transit,” he added.

Over and above opening a Press Club, the psephologist turned politician has also decided to hire a Media Manager for managing these conferences.

“Not only this, it would be nicer if some of those news channels and media outlets permanently send their reporters and camera person on an onsite duty to my residence.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/exclusive-transcript-of-aap-meeting-that-saw-yadav-and-bhushan-removed-7756,"New Delhi. Faking News has been able to acquire a full transcript of what really went on inside the AAP National Executive (NE) meet yesterday. We can verify the authenticity of this transcript as this was purchased directly from the members of AAPs official sting making body, which is known as KAC (Khufia Affairs Committee). Below is the full, original, unedited, and uncensored* transcript, for your enlightenment:

– Scene: Around 350 unshaven, sweaty, slightly obese men sitting around a table discussing burning issues that impact the aam admi today, like India’s exit from the World Cup and who would win the IPL. Certain MLAs could also be seen betting money even as Prasant Bhusan protested against unethical activities like cricket betting. Amidst the general din, Arvind Kejriwal stands up to begin his inaugural speech –

Arvind Kejriwal (AK): Upasthit sabhya aur asabhya mahoday, I thank you all for coming, and Admiral Ramdas for not coming, to this momentous occasion. I would like to start by saying how deeply hurt I am seeing all the muck being thrown around among party members in the past few weeks. I went to Bengaluru to get toxins removed from my system, however I fear with so much toxicity surrounding me, no natural or supernatural cure can come to my aide.

– Ashutosh is seeing trying to hold back his tears, Mayank Gandhi typing away a new blog on his laptop –

AK continues: You know, I formed this party to fight against corrupt people like Gadkari, Modi, and Arnab. But I can’t fight against my own colleagues. It is against my principles and sensibilities. Hence I believe it would be best to kick them out.

– Abruptly, he starts singing, horribly out of tune, the song ‘In The End’ by Linkin Park, to show his state of mind. Most members put on earphones, while Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan , Manish Sisodia and a few others start singing along –

AK: I can live with many things, be it chronic coughs, itchy mufflers, cold Delhi footpaths, or African women, but betrayal of trust is the one thing I can not accept. You must choose now between me or the rebels. I would want a fair voting, hence I state beforehand that anyone voting against me would face no discrimination. Though in my meeting earlier with Dalai Lama, I requested a handful of Shaolin Monks from him, in case I need to ‘control’ people indulging in ‘anti party activities’. Now if you would excuse me I have an urgent appointment with Azam Khan regarding the plight of aam buffaloes in India.

– AK stands up to exit the scene. Prashant Bhushan stands up with great alarm –

Prashant Bhushan (PB): You gaddar! We raised you, trained you! Made you who you are today! Without us you are nothing! You can’t kick us out without a fight! We want a trial by combat!

– PB picks up a chair and charges towards AK. Suddenly, two burly men appear from nowhere and promptly puts PB in his place. The men are revealed to be Jason Momoa and Dwane Jonson –

Yadav happy to come out of the meet without any injuries

Yogendra Yadav (YY) – visibly shaken – : W..who are these people?!

Manish Sisodia (MS) : They are members of the NE.

YY: What? But I’ve never seen them before!

MS: They are temporary members.. like, only for today.

PB – struggling to get up – : This is blasphemy! A murder of democracy! You are acting like the dark lord Sauron!

MS: Whatever. Enough of this shit! I propose that we kick these two, along with a few of their helpers, out of the NE. All those in favour raise their hands.

YY: Discussion! We want a discussion!!

Gopal Rai: Sure. Give us in writing. Make sure it’s at least 1000 words or more. Plus you get extra marks for judicious use of quotes and allegories.

– Meanwhile the count of hands continues. Some members, like Sisodia and Ashustosh can be seen putting up both hands –

PB: Now WTF is this!? Why are they allowed to put up both hands?!

Ashutosh: Why should we discriminate between both our hands? Do you mean to say one hand has more rights than the other? Is this the swaraj you believe in?

-Vote counting ends –

MS: 280 votes in favour, 8 votes against. Damn, this is like an India Pakistan WC match, not even close. LOL!

YY: This is all pre scripted. The drama being played out here seems to be written by Ekta Kapoor!

Gopal Rai: These are serious allegations. Do you have any proof?

YY: Proof?! You need more proof?! Why was our internal lokpal not allowed to attend the proceedings?

GR: Oh that’s simple. His term is coming to an end, so we decided to hire a new lokpal. In fact we have him here with us today. Please come in – gestures towards the door –

– To the visible shock and dismay of the rebels, ACP Pradyuman enters the hall. At this moment, the YY and PB camp realises the hopelessness of the situation and decides to make a hasty retreat –

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-writes-a-thank-you-letter-to-dhoni-and-times-now-for-shifting-focus-off-aaps-massive-internal-war-7743,"New Delhi. In another letter leaked from AAP, albeit this time not from Prashant Bhushan, it has been found that AAP supreme Arvind Kejriwal thanked Indian captain MS Dhoni and Times Now for helping shift focus away from massive internal war within AAP yesterday.

Worried that the most massive showdown within AAP would be hogging headlines everywhere on Prime time, Kejriwal was relieved to find ace anchor Arnab Goswami debating about India’s defeat in semi-final match against Australia instead for one hour.

Extending an olive branch to Arnab

“I was wrong about Arnab ji all along. He is not anti-AAP and certainly not anybody’s agent,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

He further told us how pleasantly shocked he was to see no media person question him about those sting tapes, ever since he returned from Bangalore.

“So somewhere I had this feeling even this thing will not get coverage from Media, but the massiveness of the rift had me in two minds and I thought maybe they will,” Kejriwal confessed.

“Also I thought this time now that India has lost and these channels would have nothing else to discuss about cricket further and they would certainly shift focus to us. But thanks to Arnab and Times Now for setting the narrative and shifting focus from us,” Kejriwal added.

When asked why did he thank Dhoni in his letter, Kejriwal shot back, “Do you really think had it not been for his effort and conduct in the world cup, Indians would have got united in standing behind him?”

Kejriwal further expressed satisfaction over no trend related to AAP hogging limelight on Twitter with #ShameonTimesNow attracting attention of one and all.

So much so that AAP volunteers did not even bother to trend stuff like #AKweAreWithYou #OpportunistBhushanYadav or any other such hashtag on Twitter to show their solidarity.

“This time supporters from all political parties were united in going after Times Now,” Kejriwal said, ““sab actually mein mile hue the ji.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arvind-kejriwal-2014-pictures.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-writes-a-thank-you-letter-to-dhoni-and-times-now-for-shifting-focus-off-aaps-massive-internal-war-7743,Kejriwal writes a thank you letter to Dhoni and Times Now for shifting focus off AAP's massive internal war,,1427444021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Bengaluru: Aam Aadmi Party chief and Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, was in the city for treatment for Jindal Hospital. While unreliable sources reveal that he went there for medical treatment, trusted sources reveal that he was there for some other reason.

Highly placed sources, who were in terrace of hospital, passed us several interesting information about stay of Kejriwal there. One such source said, “Kejriwal came here on first week of March along with his parents and was staying here for the past two weeks. The news reports and even the hospital’s medical bulletin reveals that Kejriwal came to Jindal hospital for sugar treatment. But, it is all fabrications. The truth is, Kejriwal checked in here to learn ‘Sign Language’. The photos that they display in newspapers of Kejriwal doing stuffs here is nothing but learning the sign language.”

When we asked about the reason for Sign Learning, another source, which was standing next to our primary source, said, “Kejriwalji is wary of getting caught in stings. He is now scared of each and every AAP volunteer and member. He is avoiding to talk in mobile phones nowadays. He is asking for thorough check of people visiting him. But, how many days can he continue like this? So, he has decided to learn sign language and will be using that sign language to communicate with people who will meet him in future. He is said to have told his tutor that ‘Henceforth I will sign and sign, but not resign’.”

Our Faking News team along with experts have deciphered the step-by-step training given to Kejriwal in Jindal’s hospital here. Our sources affirm that Kejriwal will discuss with anyone who comes to meet him only using these signs:

First, nose is being fine tuned to catch any ‘sting’ probability. This medicine can help Kejriwal find out anyone with camera or recorder by its smell. If found, Kejriwal will show the door(refer the 6th pic)

After the smelling part, then the sign language will start. This sign is to denote the person that “Let the discussion flow, but I will not hear a single word of it”. This means he is not interested to hear him. Will be used for party dissenters.

This sign is to persuade the person to stretch the limits of the discussion & look beyond what is in hands, i.e., announce freebies and look at Modi’s hands for funds.

This sign will be used to denote the person that the discussion is more Left than Right. Now, the direction of discussion will turn from Left to somewhat Right.

This is to bring the topic back from Right to Left. See how the Left Knee is bent upwards to symbolize that Left. The usage of alternate hand-leg is to stress the alternate form of politics that he practices.

This is ‘showing the door’ to the person, if Kejriwal is not happy with the discussion. The person should immediately leave.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/0sL1Z-6.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-went-to-bangalore-to-learn-sign-language-to-escape-future-stings-sources-7693,"Kejriwal went to Bangalore to learn Sign Language, to escape future stings: Sources",,1426920872.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-to-launch-dark-and-lovely-cream-in-indian-market-to-apply-on-fair-skinned-female-mps-first-7656,"New Delhi. Renowned female complexion expert and women body enthusiast Sharad Yadav has today announced launch of ‘Dark and lovely’ skin cream in Indian market.

Sad that nobody decided to take him seriously in the parliament and instead wanted to focus on trivial things like FDI in insurance sector, Yadav chose to take this path to get his thoughts across.

The product however already exists in African market and makers of the same approached Yadav, impressed with his conviction and how he stood by his thoughts for two consecutive sessions in Rajya Sabha.

“Farak dekhiye sirf 5 din mein”

“For years, we were confused as to how we can infiltrate the Indian market as people there are perpetually fairness obsessed. But in Mr Sharad, we found the right brand ambassador for our product and feel he can do wonders in India where even South Indians don’t respect their own skin colour as much as he does,” said spokesperson of ‘Dark and Lovely’ from South Africa.

Immediately after launching the cream, the JDU MP will carry the first tube with him in the Rajya Sabha and apply on the faces of fair skinned women MPs in the parliament.

“I want to end skin color discrimination in this country and what better place to start this noble act than my own workplace,” Sharad Yadav told Faking News, “I will ensure we have no fair skinned MP left in the parliament.”

Yadav further said that he was ready to listen to counter remarks in the debate session, provided they come from dusky complexioned colleagues and thus by applying this cream he was only ensuring that he isn’t compelled to say “I know what you are” again in the parliament.

“Pehle aap apni twacha mere se baat karne ke kaabil banaiye, fir munh kholiye,” declared the dark skin aficionado cum politician, taking a potshot at BJP MP Smriti Irani.

Yadav however rued that he could not do much about the shape of MPs bodies in such a short span of time, but is hopeful of launching a product for that too soon.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sharad-yadav.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-yadav-to-launch-dark-and-lovely-cream-in-indian-market-to-apply-on-fair-skinned-female-mps-first-7656,"Sharad Yadav to launch 'Dark and Lovely' cream in Indian market, to apply on fair skinned female MPs first",,1426578989.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"New Delhi: Several questions that have been dogging the minds of Indians for some time have been answered now. Why did Rahul Gandhi vanish? Where is he hiding? How to find him? Why did Congress lose Loksabha elections? And such.

A few days ago, BBC sent out a request to Rahul Gandhi for an interview. That is when Rahul went missing. Dreading the prospect of having to face an interview, he went underground, which has been described variously by the Congress leaders as vacation, winding down, soul searching, meditation, chilling, rejuvenating, brain(?)storming, strategizing, etc. But the fact has been established – Rahul is hiding from BBC. ‘Was hiding’, one should say, because BBC finally found him. One of the Indian journalists who was part of the BBC team related the story in depth, as below.

Two weeks ago, BBC approached Rahul Gandhi through his office, asking for an interview on important matters. The very term ‘important matters’ sent shivers down his spine and he declined to participate. However, BBC doggedly continued their pursuit. When they called him up directly on his personal number, he first did not pick up the calls. Then he said they had reached a wrong number. Then he said he was a different Rahul Gandhi. Then he spoke in a lady’s voice and told BBC that Rahul was out of office.

When he tried the same trick many times, BBC told him that they knew he was lying because they could see him in the office as they too were there. Rahul claimed to have forgotten where he was and told BBC he would meet them in a while. That was the last any one saw or heard of him.

Having waited in Rahul’s office for several days, BBC, in a desperate bid, took the help of a veteran Congress leader and one-man expert committee on Rahul Gandhi affairs, Shankar Iyer Mani (name changed to protect identity). They learnt that come what may, Rahul meets a childhood friend at least once a week, to exchange comics.

Having stayed put for about a week near the friend’s house, and disguised as comics sellers, they enticed Rahul to talk to them, with a promise to give him one more comic book than his friend would. Rahul liked the idea and started talking. But when BBC brought up the topic of interview, he got the jitters and tried to run away. But the lure of comics brought him back. And what transpired between BBC and Rahul is as follows.

BBC : Sir, we desperately want to interview you sir, please.

Rahul : But I have not applied for any job with BBC. So why do you want to?

BBC : Not a job interview sir, but…but…an interview…we ask you questions and you answer.

Rahul : What do you mean? Is this an exam or what?

BBC : No sir. It is not an exam. There won’t be a question paper and we don’t publish the result. It is oral. You just have to answer a few questions.

Rahul : How many?

BBC : Maybe about two dozen of them.

Rahul : No way. I have not answered more than five questions at a time ever, even in exams, out of the given twenty. So I will answer five.

BBC : Ok sir…. but please sir, we will cut it down to twenty.

Rahul : Six.

BBC : Fifteen.

Rahul : Eight.

BBC : Ten

Rahul : Done.

BBC : Sir, we will start recording now. Are you ready sir?

“YAY! 0 questions left”

Rahul : What do you mean? Why do you have to record it? Anyway one question down.

BBC : To show it on television sir.

Rahul : You mean I will be shown on TV?! Whoa!

BBC : Yes sir. Just like you came on TV some time ago, on Times Now.

Rahul : Oh No! No way am I going to do this interview. I am leaving.

(Saying this, Rahul bolted. BBC crew ran after him.)

BBC : Sir, Sir…it is not that. We are from BBC…not Times Now.

Rahul : Is Arnab Goswami around? Then I am going.

BBC : No sir. He is not there. He does not work for us. He does not work for anybody. In fact he does not work at all.

Rahul : You are right. He only plays games with people. But where is he?

BBC : Don’t worry sir, he is miles away. We won’t let him harm you. Can we start?

Rahul : Thanks. You can start. That was the second question. Eight left.

BBC : Why did you lose sir?

Rahul : Who said I lost? I always score the highest in all games. Ask my friends if you want. I am the top scorer in Temple Run. I have reached the highest level in Angry Birds. I scored a century in Book Cricket. I lose only in Tic-Tac-Toe.

BBC : Not that sir. Why did you lose in the Loksabha election?

Rahul : Oh! You mean the election. I did not lose. I won the election…..I think….that is what they told me. In fact Smriti Irani congratulated me. And so did many others.

BBC : Sorry sir, not you. Why did Congress lose the election?

Rahul : Oh okay…I too though about it. Quite a bit. I asked several people. And I found out the reason. It is because we did not get enough votes. Other candidates won. That is why we lost.

BBC : Then, why did you get lesser votes than others?

Rahul : It is my mistake. I lied to the people of India. I misled them. That is why they did not vote us.

BBC : Oh! So honest of you sir. What lie did you tell them?

Rahul : I kept telling them that there are six bills pending in the parliament, on important issues like women empowerment. In fact there were only four. That is the mistake I made. And the party had to pay for it.

BBC : But some say your family’s tight control on all affairs affected the party’s chances in the election. What do you think?

Rahul : That is not true. Ours is a great family. The Gandhi family. We all belong to the Gandhi family. Me, my sister, my mother, jijaji…all of us. Except our grandfather Jawaharlal. He was the only exception. I don’t know why he did not belong to our family. He belonged to the Nehru family. Our family is so great and so respected that Bapuji, the father of the nation himself adopted our family name and called himself Mohandas Gandhi. Anyway, you have two questions left.

BBC : Sir.but what about Robert Vadra that belongs to your family? Land deals.…?

Rahul : Sorry. I can’t answer that. Mummy has told me not to speak about jijaji, that too with strangers, even if they offer comic books. Last question!

BBC : Sir, some people say you are on vacation. When will you get back to work?

Rahul : Good question. Now that this interview is over, I have nothing to fear. I will immediately go back. Now, give me my comics.

BBC returned a happy team, for they could ultimately interview Rahul Gandhi. However, trouble started after that. After viewing the preview of the interview, and obviously embarrassed, the Congress said the interviewee was not Rahul at all. They accused BBC of using Rahul’s dummy in order to project Rahul as a dunce, at the behest of BJP, and demanded that the telecast of the interview be banned.

On the other hand, the Indian government felt the interview would show India and Indian politicians in poor light and sought to ban the telecast. BBC, first upset with a second ban on its program in just a couple of weeks, referred the matter to its own review committee. The committee was aghast at the content of the interview and readily supported the ban and decided not to air it in any part of the world.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rahul_Gandhi_360x270_rg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bbc-tracks-down-rahul-gandhi-for-interview-india-and-bbc-both-ban-the-telecast-7654,"BBC tracks down Rahul Gandhi for interview, India and BBC both ban the telecast",,1426502149.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,"Faking News has found out that at least 5 miniseries did order a snoop on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for various reasons that could benefit different sections of the society. Here they are:

1. HRD Ministry: HRD ministry confirms that they ordered snooping on Rahul Gandhi as they were in the process to design the perfect curriculum for kindergarten kids. “We wanted to observe what is it that young minds of this country like and prefer, and who better than youth icon Rahul Gandhi himself to study and understand young minds,” confirmed a source from HRD ministry.

2. Finance Ministry: With India struggling to get its act together after economic slowdown, finance ministry was keen to understand how a man with virtually no work and zero income take so many holidays and enjoy so much. “We would then make use of the information thus gathered for under privileged people of the country,” said a close aide of FM, “Poverty truly is a state of mind.”

Jumping the hurdles with elan.

3. Sports Ministry: “We were amazed to see at how well Rahul Gandhi crosses hurdles in his path (pics attached). We certainly see a future Olympic gold medalist in him,” Sports Minister revealed why he wanted to snoop on Rahul.

Always taking the path less traveled.

4. Health Ministry: “How could a person look so stress free even during worst of adversities. How could a person afford a smile when the party he is the VP of faces defeat after defeat? Also how could someone remain youth even after crossing 45 years of age. We certainly want to know the secret,” stated a press release from Health Ministry.

“Is he for real?” wondered Health Minsiter

5. Ministry of Corporate Affairs: Many aspiring to be CEOs had written a letter to the ministry wanting to know the secret of how somebody can keep on getting promotions in his job without doing anything.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/26ph-t140906z2138041784gm1ea2q1ph201rtrmadp3india.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/5-ministries-that-snooped-on-rahul-gandhi-and-their-reasons-7650,5 ministries that snooped on Rahul Gandhi and their reasons,,1426499535.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/an-aam-aadmis-normal-day-in-the-reign-of-aap-7350,"Good morning Delhi,

I am feeling so good that I could have shouted Good Morning to the whole of Delhi. Two events which I enjoy are slated for this day, but other things first.

One must appreciate that government is very effective. Power comes exactly as per schedule, at 6 AM, never a minute late and lasts full 26 minutes, never a minute less.

Coincidentally, it matches my alarm time and I feel privileged to have government as my butler!

Animal Farm – II

As I wake up, I face the first, difficult choice. Whether to go for breakfast which would be distributed from 7 AM to 8 AM or use my quota of wifi whose schedule coincides with former? Can’t do both as breakfast queues being longer, by the time I get it, internet time would be over.

It does feel good to have options in life, even better when they are free.

Oh! Shit! Public address system has become active. Seems I forgot to wear my cap again. Damn these cameras which have been put in every bedroom. Authorities watch for the ones who do not wear their caps within 30 seconds of waking up.

Keeping your cap on your head, except while sleeping is one chore that I don’t like. But, as they say, ours is not to reason why, ours is to do or die, both with cap on the head.

I decide to go without food. Food is available thrice a day but wifi is only once a day. Wise choice! As they say, man’s wisdom is tested in times of great difficulty!

Internet is fun! The life story of Kejriwal Ji is so motivating and thrilling that I read it almost daily. Then there are awe inspiring stories about the Judge, also known as Bhartiji, about the times when he roamed streets at night identifying and punishing those who did not conform to the standards of our utopian society. I get so engrossed that the internet time gets over in a jiffy and I am left wishing for more. But then, one needs to follow discipline.

College is a welcome place in winter, though we shift to shade of trees in summer. The classes are in the open, Sun warms our bodies and we forget the freezing cold which seeps through the tarpaulin that is also called ceiling in our house. That reminds me. Father had given a housekeeping errand to me. I have to lodge a complaint for the leaky tarpaulin. Even when you get the house for free, housekeeping can keep you busy.

Anyway, today we have practical on Projectile Science and I enjoy this. This course, started in 2017, is very popular among students. I have the special knack of hitting the glass window beyond the railing every time I throw the projectile (It used to be called stone, a few years back). This skill makes me a hero in the class and adorable son for my parents. The son who would become a party volunteer one day and bring more food to the table, more power for the heaters , probably thicker tarpaulin which can keep the cold (& heat) out and more hours of internet.

It is lunch time, now.

Only 35 minutes of standing in the queue and I get my lunch! I should have asked for something bigger today.

It is rice and some gruel which I can’t recognize. The serving boy understands my uncomprehending look, nods his head and says, “It is Dal, today”. Kind fellow! He knows it is difficult for me to eat something without knowing what it is.

The public address system announces that the onions we had imported from Maharashtra are stuck on the way. The neighbouring state, Haryana demanded toll for using a highway and Kejriwal Ji has declared toll payment illegal and a sin. The drivers are observing a sit in protest on the highway, along with our onions.

But I have no complaints. Anything for Swaraj!

As I walk towards home, my thought turn to the event I have been waiting for. It is our monthly Kiss of Love festival. The best part is that our Mohalla Committee chairman has promised a beautiful girl to partner with me, as a quid pro quo of tutoring his son in The Art of Misinformation. Just hope that he keeps his word.

Last time I had to kiss that baldy, fat chairman himself as only two of us remained unattached at the end. Aarrgh!

Oh my Yugpurush! What is that, lying in the middle of the road? Looks like a currency note! When was the last time I saw a currency note? It must have been three, no, four years. I rush to pick it up, as do many others. I reach their first, am able to palm the note but scores are jostling with me, pushing me, pulling at me to snatch that note. I am being shaken, thrown around violently.

And I wake up with a start!

As I open my eyes, I realize I am back in my world, in 2015. It is my mother who is waking me up, telling me to get ready. We have to go and vote today.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/animal-farm.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/an-aam-aadmis-normal-day-in-the-reign-of-aap-7350,An Aam Aadmi's normal day in the reign of AAP,,1423119783.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aam-aadmi-party-changes-its-name-to-honest-party-7344,"New Delhi: Just few days before elections, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has announced that from now on, Aam Aadmi Party would be known as ‘Honest Party’.

Speaking to the media, Kejariwal said, “We were using the name Aam Aadmi Party for the past two years. But now, with us ruling the Delhi, I think we need to upgrade our party name and give it a new touch. Earlier this month, I started a campaign called ‘I fund honest party’. Though we got two crores out of that fund raiser, many complained that they were confused over a new ‘Honest Party’. Maybe, our well-wishers were expecting to donate for Aam Aadmi party and our volunteers went with Honest Party banners for chanda and this might have confused them. ”

Even the Google says it right

After a cough once, he continued, “That is why we met with all the volunteers and top brass of AAP. And we discussed for hours and everyone decided to keep the party name as AAP itself. They said that the name AAP has stayed and will stay in politics forever and so a name-change will be a disaster. That is why, I have decided to change the party name from Aam Aadmi Party to Honest Party. We will do the name change after February 10, so that voters don’t get confused. Eventhough voters know that Honest Party can be only AAP, yet why give room for chotta parties like BJP to misuse that title ji?”

An AAP volunteer was seen celebrating the name change. She said, “Everytime, we used to claim that we are the only honest party. But from today, we are Honest Party, literally. No other political party in the world is Honest Party except us. Even if the dirty tricks department throws false allegations against us, we can say to the world that we are Honest Party. And even the journos of the world will sympathize with us by putting headlines that ‘Modi is trying to target Honest Party’. This is a win-win situation and a masterstroke by our CM. ”

We saw few AAP leaders canvassing for the “biggest event of this millennium” – Delhi elections. One of them was asked by an old lady, “Why should we vote for you?” to which one leader replied, “We are Honest Party.” And then the lady said, “Then, we will surely vote for the honest party.”

Meanwhile, with the allegations of illegal funds transfer of 2 crores surfacing against AAP, we spoke with a Delhi voter.

In their last bid to up the ante in the final leg of campaigning for Delhi elections, Congress has today decided to target itself for the remaining few days of the campaign.

The Congress Working Committee took this decision after their desperate attempts to get both BJP and AAP to target it and give it some publicity failed.

“With both AAP and BJP attacking only each other, we tried to remind them about the alleged misrule they used to accuse us of only sometime back, but they still didn’t attack us. We were feeling even more ignored than Shiromani Akali Dal in Tamil Nadu,” said Arvinder Singh lovely.

Maken and Lovely showing the first negative poster of their party that they have finalized.

“Arre bhai koi hum par bhi kuch aaroop laga do plz,” Maken is reported to have cried in a rally, before realizing that Congress will have to take the matter in its own hands now.

As a part of its negative campaign against itself, Congress went to various Delhi voters to ask as to why exactly they hate Congress in Delhi despite it doing fairly well under Sheila Dixit’s regime.

“So far they appear as confused as we are about where exactly we went wrong. Probably too much development for 15 years under Sheila Dixit ji irritated locals as they could not keep pace with so much development in Delhi,” claimed Maken pointing to how one local complained of getting confused while commuting on Delhi roads with so many flyovers and underpasses.

Now Congress is set to release their first set of the posters attacking itself. If the response is good they plan to come out with more anti-self posters.

“Ajay Maken ji will personally paste those posters behind every auto in Delhi today,” revealed Maken.

When asked how Congress stands to gain through this tactic, Maken said that Congress was not just going to stop at that, but will also apologize for the mistakes highlighted in the posters.

“Dilli ki janta ka dil bahut bada hai ji. Woh kisi ko bhi maaf kar deti hai ji,” Maken revealed how Congress intends to get sympathy votes by playing victim card.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/congress-650_020415074310.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/frustrated-with-no-one-targeting-it-congress-to-attack-itself-in-the-last-few-days-of-delhi-election-campaign-7338,"Frustrated with no one targeting it, Congress to attack itself in the last few days of Delhi election campaign",,1423038832.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/adam-and-eve-were-bjp-agents-claims-kejriwal-7328,"New Delhi. “Adam and Eve, first humans of the universe were agents of BJP,” claimed Aam Aadmi Party convener Mr. Arvind Kejriwal while he was addressing reporters at a press briefing in connection with the forthcoming assembly elections in Delhi. They could also be agents of Ambani, he added for good measure.

The reporters were shocked by his startling claim and pointed out to the impossibility of this eventuality, but Arvind Kejriwal insisted that his claim was backed by evidence. He went on to present the evidence.

“Adam and Eve did not belong to Garden of Eden, they did not establish it or nurture it. They did not give their blood and sweat for making it grow big and green. They were just para-dropped into this garden against the wishes of other animals. Now, all of us know that this, para-dropping of leaders happens in BJP only. It is BJP which promotes such VIP culture. They had no respect for other animals just like they don’t have any respect for aam aadmi today.”

Despite this high inflation, how were they eating apple?

“Second proof lies in the apple. Can you tell me, in this period of high inflation, when an aam aadmi cannot even afford potatos and tomatoes, how were Adam and Eve eating an apple? How is this possible without having black money? Something is wrong, somewhere! Someone has taken a bribe, a lot of it!”

“Third piece of evidence is in the fact that while God severely punished the serpent and let Adam & Eve off lightly. This is the proof that all, including judiciary at that time were involved in this game of looting the poor. You would remember how I was jailed for a week because I called Gadkari corrupt. Now tell me, in which government’s rule the corrupt roam around in luxury cars and those who protest against corruption go to jail? Such situation can only happen when BJP are in government.”

“Fourth proof is that the offspring of Adam & Eve were two in number, called Cain and Abel. Is it a coincidence that Ambanis brothers too are two in number? This clearly establishes the connection of Ambanis with Adam and Eve.”

“We are getting more evidence of BJP’s involvement in tempting Adam and Eve on the path of sin. We have received information that the serpent was Amit Shah’s agent and his punishment was only a drama. A BJP leader who does not like the corruption in his party has agreed to provide us the video of the meeting between Amit Shah and the serpent. We would expose BJP completely.”

With this Mr. Kejriwal concluded the press briefing. The reporters did not ask any questions as they had been informed about Mr. Kejriwal’s aversion to anyone else asking questions.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kejriwal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/adam-and-eve-were-bjp-agents-claims-kejriwal-7328,"Adam and Eve were BJP agents, claims Kejriwal",,1422945106.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a strange incident that took place in Ashok Vihar area of North Delhi, two brothers who had separated 20 years ago during Kumbh Mela, got united once again thanks to aggressive door to door campaigning happening in Delhi for upcoming elections.

It all happened when Sharad Narang, an AAP volunteer knocked on the door of Vinod Narang, a known BJP supporter, late evening yesterday.

“Reading Narang nameplate outside the kothi, I was thinking to myself that like Kejriwal sir tried to woo entire baniya community by using his caste, I too would be able to establish some rapport and relation with those in the house, but was utterly shocked to find, I already have a relation with the man standing in front of me,” revealed Sharad.

Definitely not brothers.

But the BJP supporting brother says he wasn’t surprised with having found his AAP volunteer brother through this manner.

“I knew this insane level door to door campaigning that was happening all around was my best chance to meet my long lost brother and was at door to receive everyone for last few days,” Vinod told Faking News.

As soon as the news of brother’s unison became viral, both AAP and BJP jumped to take credit for it.

“Its correct that both of them got united. But yeh bhi toh bataiye ki gaya kaun ji? Pahal kisne ki ji?” asked Kejriwal as he made way to hug both brothers out of nowhere.

“It was the AAP volunteer who went to the house of BJP supporter. It shows that AAP is a party that takes initiatives to do things correctly and sets the agenda,” added the local AAP MLA who pounced on anybody who hailed destiny for brother’s unison.

“Toh Kya hua? Ghar ke darwaaze kisne khole, yeh batao. It was the BJP supporter. It clearly shows how open we are to new thoughts, people, ideas etc,” said Satish Upadhyay, BJP President, who too left the rally he was in midway to come to Ashok Vihar.

After this, local MLAs of both the parties started pulling up arms of both the brother’s towards themselves to get them on their side.

It was only after both brothers, (who were completely shocked by how the focus had shifted from their unison to political upmanship) threatened to vote for Congress that leader of both the parties stopped pulling their arms and left the place.

Meanwhile wary of the way aggressive campaigning is happening, a resident of Paschim Puri has locked himself in his newly rented room till elections are over.

“With the way unisons are happening, I am scared of being united with my lenders,” said Deepak (name changed).",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/modi-kejri.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/brothers-separated-at-kumbh-meet-during-door-to-door-campaign-for-delhi-elections-7322,"Brothers separated at Kumbh, meet during door to door campaign for Delhi elections",,1422870291.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Out of favor with the electorate, out of fear of a complete wash-out & out of sheer lack of any other option, Delhi Congress committee has taken to the tried & tested route to salvage some of its lost pride.

When opinion polls across the board have written the party off, as a last resort and some ingenuous creativity the party has brought on board Kaul, a great grandson of the great Oracle, Paul, the octopus to provide a constituency wise prediction of its chances of winning a seat.

Congress’ last ray of hope in the Delhi elections

The idea was a brainchild of Mr. Ajay Maken, the party’s face of the sporadic Congress one finds in the city. A spokesperson confirmed the news saying, “The opinion polls predicted gloom for the party, we needed to be like the ‘party with a difference’. Plus the accuracy of such polls are always doubtful, so Mr. Maken thought why not dare to think beyond such polls and in came the idea about Paul. Sadly, due to the unfortunate demise of the great soul, we requested the owner to provide us with someone from the same lineage. This is how Kaul has come into our office.”

Boris, trainer of Kaul laments, “This is such a futile exercise. I don’t know what am I going to teach this octopus. I don’t know who Paul was, I’ve been told to teach Kaul to dip into three jars of food containing flags of BJP, Congress and AAP & get him to develop the liking for Congress flag. These guys think since he has the same DNA as Paul, Kaul would be equally successful.”

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra didn’t waste an opportunity to take a dig at Congress, “This is a proof of Congress being a dynastic party. Why could they not get Kamla, the cow for the job? We are a party with meritocracy & I assure you if and when we do get someone to predict, it will do a better job than Kaul. Do you need more proof than the results of the last election?”

Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal lead AAP has already released posters asking voters the question – Whose prediction do you think is more ‘HONEST’ – Kaul, the Octopus or Yogendra Yadav?",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Octopus.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-recruits-paul-the-octopus-kin-to-predict-a-favorable-verdict-in-the-delhi-polls-7318,Congress recruits Paul the Octopus' kin to predict a favorable verdict in the Delhi polls,,1422771584.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after former minister Jayanthi Natarajan balmed Rahul Gandhi for asking her to resign from her post just before Lok Sabha elections without giving any exact reasons, Congress Vice President attacked back by claiming that it was a kind of test, which Jayanthi failed miserably.

Elaborating his claims, Rahul Gandhi revealed that he was expecting Jayanthi Natarajan to use RTI to know why exactly she was asked to resign.

“She doesn’t know when to use RTI, Congress is better without her”

“I keep testing IQ of leaders around me by creating situations around them, as I hate being surrounded by people with lower IQ. Plus, you know my feelings for RTI and how badly back in summers of 2014 I was in love with it. So, just to make sure that other senior Congress leaders are also in love with RTI and know its importance, I thought to mix IQ test with RTI,” said Rahul Gandhi explaining his side of the story.

Adding further, Rahul said that for last 11 months, he was waiting for Jayanthi to ask him the reason why she was asked to resign, but through an RTI inquiry.

“All she had to do was to say, ‘I want to know this thing under my right to information,’ that’s all. But unfortunately, that never clicked in her mind. I think she is a bit slow,” Rahul continued, “Everyone can’t be Digvijay uncle.”

Reportedly, once Rahul Gandhi took spectacles of Digvijay Singh and hid it on the table in front of him. But Digvijay Singh, instead of directly asking, ‘Where are my spectacles Rahul Ji’, handled the situation smartly and said, “Rahul Ji, under RTI, I want to know where are my spectacles.”

“Jayanthi Ji never had that spark of natural intelligence, all she kept doing was following my orders, like a robot and I am bored of playing with robots,” Rahul Gandhi told Faking News, “It is good that she has left the party. Our average IQ has increased.”

When asked if it was not against his other pet idea of “Women Empowerment” to force Jayanthi Natarajan to resign, Rahul Gandhi asked this reporter to file an RTI to get the answer.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rahul-Gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayanthi-ji-could-have-used-rti-to-know-why-she-was-asked-to-resign-it-was-an-iq-test-rahul-gandhi-7310,"Jayanthi Ji could have used RTI to know why she was asked to resign, it was an IQ test : Rahul Gandhi",,1422613874.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Dismissing suggestions that he himself found Kiran Bedi (who they now claim a BJP mole in JanLokpal movement) better suited for CM responsibility, Kejriwal claims that the offer to make her CM stood only for 49 days.

Kiran Bedi asking Kejriwal to keep a file of Narendra Modi’s governance, if he wants her to be CM.

“As you know my patience levels are very short and nothing holds my attention beyond 49 days, same was the case while making on offer to Kiran ji last year. Do you really think I would have let her remain CM beyond that,” Kejriwal told Faking News, rubbishing Bedi’s accusation that Kejriwal trusted her more than himself.

“Even if I had not resigned on 14th Feb, the plan was that I would take over after 49 days and would be the CM for next 49 days. Then Manish Sisodia, Somnath Bharti, and so on. This way every AAP MLA in Delhi and maybe even few AAP supporters would have got a chance to be Delhi CM,” he went on to reveal AAP’s plan last year.

“You see I was not lying, when I said CM main nahi hoon ji, balki aap log hain ji,” he pointed as to how he was not megalomaniac.

However some AAP insiders also claim that Kejriwal was not cheating Delhi voters this way as irrespective of anyone who sat on CM’s chair , Kejriwal would have actually run the affairs, just Sonia Gandhi controlled PM’s chair for 10 years.

Claiming that his offer is still open, Kejriwal asked Kiran Bedi to again reconsider his offer.

“With BJP set to lose badly this time, she has no chance, but if she joins AAP, she will at least get to be CM for few days,” he said as he lured Bedi for one last time.

When Faking News called Kiran Bedi’s to get her response on this offer, the call automatically got diverted to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra’s phone every time.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/45923069.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-defends-offering-cms-chair-to-kiran-bedi-earlier-says-the-offer-was-only-for-49-days-7291,"Kejriwal defends offering CM's chair to Kiran Bedi earlier, says the offer was only for 49 days",,1422519625.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

As per our sources, talks between the BJP leadership and the Obamas have been going on ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S. last September. Michelle Obama will be the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming Delhi elections.

“Hello Dilli”

Looks like BJP wasn’t very confident of Kiran Bedi winning the assembly elections for them. A senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, told us, “The party leadership was worried about the possibility of another hung assembly, which would cause a depreciation in the speed of propagation and energy density of the Modi wave.”

When asked why they are roping in Michelle Obama for the job rather than giving a chance to their own deserving candidates such as Shazia Ilmi, he exclaimed, “We are not content with #CheckmateAAP. We want #FlawlessVictoryBJP to trend on twitter.”

This might come as a shock to Kiran Bedi who was unavailable for a comment. Although she is not the only BJP leader unhappy with the developments. Sakshi Maharaj and his supporters have raised their voices against this move. They are reportedly unhappy with the fact that Michelle Obama has only two children, half the count required for a woman to ascertain her worth.

No AAP leader in the capital was available for a comment while the party workers were still digging the internet for the screenshots of Kiran Bedi’s deleted anti-BJP tweets. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Washington unit is planning on a dharna outside the White House, demanding a probe into how Barack Obama is using the taxpayers’ money to travel to India for personal gains.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-announces-n-srinivasan-as-its-cm-candidate-for-delhi-bjp-and-aap-withdraw-7251,"New Delhi: BJP and AAP are fighting against each other while not giving an iota of attention to the third party that once ruled Delhi – Congress. Congress introduced Ajay Maken, but he was never taken for debates or was never shown the mike by news channels.

Dejected by this unpopularity, Congress tried to cash in on the Bedi factor by stating that Mandira Bedi is their CM candidate. However, she too rejected that offer.

Now Congress has gone for a masterstroke – it has announced that BCCI boss N Srinivasan will be its Chief Ministerial candidate in Delhi elections.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had barred Srinivasan from contesting BCCI elections. Congress offered Srini Mama to contest Delhi elections, and he readily agreed.

Congress has already started putting up posters and banners anointing Srini as CM. These posters (one such in the image above) were plastered on areas where Obama will visit while in Delhi.

This news has sent ripples across the political spectrum. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) both are shell shocked.

According to sources, Kiran Bedi ran up to Amit Shah asking to cancel her nomination, while Kejriwal took his Wagon-R car to take continuous U-Turns outside the Election Commission office.

On the other hand, after six months of slumber, Congress workers in Delhi were seen celebrating this announcement with crackers and distributing sweets and thanking Rahul Gandhi’s vision.

“As far as the elections across the world are concerned, N Srinivasan is the only person who has never lost in any elections. His name never came up in the voters list, but it will always appear in the candidates list,” an expert explained the reactions of political parties.

Sources tell Faking News that Shazia Imli, Vinod Binny, and many defectors from AAP to BJP are now ready to take another jump to Congress.

“I find myself back to home at Congress. They always say that your first jump might be of short duration, but the third company you land in will be your permanent one. I feel like that,” Shazia Ilmi tweeted.

The left-outs in AAP like Yogendra Yavad and Ashish Khaten too are headed to join Congress, sources confirm. “The only thing that kept them away from Congress was because Congress had started losing. Now with Srini Mama at helm, there is no reason,” a source revealed.

With these ground shaking developments, BJP and AAP have decided not to contest Delhi elections. Kiran Bedi is planning to start a fresh reality show on TV, while Kejriwal has requested Anna Hazare to give him another chance. BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi was seen taking selfies with his posters that were plastered across Delhi by AAP.

Ever since AAP founder and mentor Shanti Bhushan called Kiran Bedi as a better Chief Ministerial candidate than Arvind Kejriwal, people in AAP circles had gone into an overdrive collecting corruption charges and allegations against him.

However unable to gather their standard 300 pages of corruption evidence against Bhushan Sr even after 24 hours since his comment, has created a state of panic in AAP headquarters.

Shanti Bhushan preferring to stand closer to Bedi than Kejriwal, a proof he was always with corrupt BJP, insisted AAP.

Leaders have started doubting their capabilities and wondering if they have lost the midas touch of just about labeling and proving anyone corrupt.

“Are we losing it? Do we now have it in us to get a 300 page corruption proof against anyone and everyone as and when the need demands,” wondered Manish Sisodia as he went into an introspective drive.

Sources tell Faking News that brains at AAP tried many things to achieve the feat. But even after taking corruption of Shanti’s close friends, relatives, neighbours, etc into consideration, AAP was unable to take the figure up to 300 pages.

“Even Prashant being a true AAPian agreed to sacrifice his own image for party’s sake and offered proofs of some corruption he did while submitting fake petrol bills during his time as lawyer in a private firm, but still the figure did not touch 300,” revealed an AAP insider.

“At one point we were so depressed that, we thought of shortening the size of each page. But still couldn’t touch the magical figure,” he went on to disclose.

Some AAP volunteers even dig up an old piece of Shanti Bhushan where he had criticized Kejriwal, as a proof that Bhushan was always corrupt from beginning, but senior leaders asked them to forget it as people may have also forgotten about it.

Now AAP is in the process of setting up a chance encounter between Shanti Bhushan and some industrialist already declared corrupt by AAP like Adani, Ambani etc.

Police was called in after a riot broke out between two rival groups in front of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Office. The reason for the riot has left both the party & the authority bewildered.

Two known rival Congress leaders had taken out rallies in support of each other to be awarded the party ticket from Rohini constituency in Delhi for the upcoming legislative assembly elections. In normal times, the scenes would have been different with the rival claiming to get tickets for themselves. But times have changed as it stands today.

So much love

Neelkamal Rathi and Vijay Dahiya, 2 leaders from the party have been political rivals for generations. Sources tell Faking News that their buffaloes too refuse to give milk if it wanders to the rival’s territory. So it did appear to be a pleasant surprise when Neelkamal openly requested the party to give ticket to Vijay.

What Neelkamal had claimed was, “Abki baari, Vijay karega bhains sawaari” (This time, Vijay will ride the buffalo). This some claimed was a jovial reference to ride to the Legislative Assembly.

However, things are not what they seem. In a flash, Vijay Dahiya came out in support of Neelkamal, “High command se badi vinati hai, Neelkama tau ko banao ummedwaar, is baar” (I request the party high-command to nominate Neelkamal Uncle as the party candidate, this time).

While this show of brotherhood was surprising, it was almost amusing to observe this goodwill between two rivals. However as faith had it, this was no show of friendship but a deeply sinister ploy to get even one more time while their party lay in coma.

It is now come to light that both candidates knowing that chances of Congress winning the elections were less than Taliban turning to Gandhigiri, they were under no situation willing to get tickets to contest. Also since the loss of anyone contesting on a Congress ticket was divinely sealed by Lord Brahma himself, they wanted to get even with each other. Hence both took out processions in support of each other to the Party Headquarters where this so-called bonhomie was exposed.

A party insider on conditions of anonymity disclosed, “These candidates are treating the party as aged parents whom none of the brothers want to keep at their place.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Fight.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fight-in-front-of-congress-office-between-2-rival-groups-to-give-the-ticket-to-each-other-7238,Fight in front of Congress office between 2 rival groups to give the ticket to each other,,1422000017.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

I am feeling so good that I could have shouted Good Morning to the whole of Delhi. Two events which I enjoy are slated for this day, but other things first.

One must appreciate that government is very effective. Power comes exactly as per schedule, at 6 AM, never a minute late and lasts full 26 minutes, never a minute less.

Coincidentally, it matches my alarm time and I feel privileged to have government as my butler!

Animal Farm – II

As I wake up, I face the first, difficult choice. Whether to go for breakfast which would be distributed from 7 AM to 8 AM or use my quota of wifi whose schedule coincides with former? Can’t do both as breakfast queues being longer, by the time I get it, internet time would be over.

It does feel good to have options in life, even better when they are free.

Oh! Shit! Public address system has become active. Seems I forgot to wear my cap again. Damn these cameras which have been put in every bedroom. Authorities watch for the ones who do not wear their caps within 30 seconds of waking up.

Keeping your cap on your head, except while sleeping is one chore that I don’t like. But, as they say, ours is not to reason why, ours is to do or die, both with cap on the head.

I decide to go without food. Food is available thrice a day but wifi is only once a day. Wise choice! As they say, man’s wisdom is tested in times of great difficulty!

Internet is fun! The life story of Kejriwal Ji is so motivating and thrilling that I read it almost daily. Then there are awe inspiring stories about the Judge, also known as Bhartiji, about the times when he roamed streets at night identifying and punishing those who did not conform to the standards of our utopian society. I get so engrossed that the internet time gets over in a jiffy and I am left wishing for more. But then, one needs to follow discipline.

College is a welcome place in winter, though we shift to shade of trees in summer. The classes are in the open, Sun warms our bodies and we forget the freezing cold which seeps through the tarpaulin that is also called ceiling in our house. That reminds me. Father had given a housekeeping errand to me. I have to lodge a complaint for the leaky tarpaulin. Even when you get the house for free, housekeeping can keep you busy.

Anyway, today we have practical on Projectile Science and I enjoy this. This course, started in 2017, is very popular among students. I have the special knack of hitting the glass window beyond the railing every time I throw the projectile (It used to be called stone, a few years back). This skill makes me a hero in the class and adorable son for my parents. The son who would become a party volunteer one day and bring more food to the table, more power for the heaters , probably thicker tarpaulin which can keep the cold (& heat) out and more hours of internet.

It is lunch time, now.

Only 35 minutes of standing in the queue and I get my lunch! I should have asked for something bigger today.

It is rice and some gruel which I can’t recognize. The serving boy understands my uncomprehending look, nods his head and says, “It is Dal, today”. Kind fellow! He knows it is difficult for me to eat something without knowing what it is.

The public address system announces that the onions we had imported from Maharashtra are stuck on the way. The neighbouring state, Haryana demanded toll for using a highway and Kejriwal Ji has declared toll payment illegal and a sin. The drivers are observing a sit in protest on the highway, along with our onions.

But I have no complaints. Anything for Swaraj!

As I walk towards home, my thought turn to the event I have been waiting for. It is our monthly Kiss of Love festival. The best part is that our Mohalla Committee chairman has promised a beautiful girl to partner with me, as a quid pro quo of tutoring his son in The Art of Misinformation. Just hope that he keeps his word.

Last time I had to kiss that baldy, fat chairman himself as only two of us remained unattached at the end. Aarrgh!

Oh my Yugpurush! What is that, lying in the middle of the road? Looks like a currency note! When was the last time I saw a currency note? It must have been three, no, four years. I rush to pick it up, as do many others. I reach their first, am able to palm the note but scores are jostling with me, pushing me, pulling at me to snatch that note. I am being shaken, thrown around violently.

And I wake up with a start!

As I open my eyes, I realize I am back in my world, in 2015. It is my mother who is waking me up, telling me to get ready.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aam-aadmi-party-changes-its-name-to-honest-party-7344,"New Delhi: Just few days before elections, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has announced that from now on, Aam Aadmi Party would be known as ‘Honest Party’.

Speaking to the media, Kejariwal said, “We were using the name Aam Aadmi Party for the past two years. But now, with us ruling the Delhi, I think we need to upgrade our party name and give it a new touch. Earlier this month, I started a campaign called ‘I fund honest party’. Though we got two crores out of that fund raiser, many complained that they were confused over a new ‘Honest Party’. Maybe, our well-wishers were expecting to donate for Aam Aadmi party and our volunteers went with Honest Party banners for chanda and this might have confused them. ”

Even the Google says it right

After a cough once, he continued, “That is why we met with all the volunteers and top brass of AAP. And we discussed for hours and everyone decided to keep the party name as AAP itself. They said that the name AAP has stayed and will stay in politics forever and so a name-change will be a disaster. That is why, I have decided to change the party name from Aam Aadmi Party to Honest Party. We will do the name change after February 10, so that voters don’t get confused. Eventhough voters know that Honest Party can be only AAP, yet why give room for chotta parties like BJP to misuse that title ji?”

An AAP volunteer was seen celebrating the name change. She said, “Everytime, we used to claim that we are the only honest party. But from today, we are Honest Party, literally. No other political party in the world is Honest Party except us. Even if the dirty tricks department throws false allegations against us, we can say to the world that we are Honest Party. And even the journos of the world will sympathize with us by putting headlines that ‘Modi is trying to target Honest Party’. This is a win-win situation and a masterstroke by our CM. ”

We saw few AAP leaders canvassing for the “biggest event of this millennium” – Delhi elections. One of them was asked by an old lady, “Why should we vote for you?” to which one leader replied, “We are Honest Party.” And then the lady said, “Then, we will surely vote for the honest party.”

Meanwhile, with the allegations of illegal funds transfer of 2 crores surfacing against AAP, we spoke with a Delhi voter.

He said, “Imagine.. If AAP can make non-existent companies to donate amount as high as fifty lakhs, then how much they can do to existing companies? Every aam aadmi in Delhi will become khaas aadmi in 5 years, if you make those 5 years as Paanch Saal Kejariwal. This is the real achche din for Delhi. Previously I was in doubt, but now no doubt, I will vote for AAP only.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AAP.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aam-aadmi-party-changes-its-name-to-honest-party-7344,"Aam Aadmi Party changes its name to ""Honest Party""",,1423046436.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In their last bid to up the ante in the final leg of campaigning for Delhi elections, Congress has today decided to target itself for the remaining few days of the campaign.

The Congress Working Committee took this decision after their desperate attempts to get both BJP and AAP to target it and give it some publicity failed.

“With both AAP and BJP attacking only each other, we tried to remind them about the alleged misrule they used to accuse us of only sometime back, but they still didn’t attack us. We were feeling even more ignored than Shiromani Akali Dal in Tamil Nadu,” said Arvinder Singh lovely.

Maken and Lovely showing the first negative poster of their party that they have finalized.

“Arre bhai koi hum par bhi kuch aaroop laga do plz,” Maken is reported to have cried in a rally, before realizing that Congress will have to take the matter in its own hands now.

As a part of its negative campaign against itself, Congress went to various Delhi voters to ask as to why exactly they hate Congress in Delhi despite it doing fairly well under Sheila Dixit’s regime.

“So far they appear as confused as we are about where exactly we went wrong. Probably too much development for 15 years under Sheila Dixit ji irritated locals as they could not keep pace with so much development in Delhi,” claimed Maken pointing to how one local complained of getting confused while commuting on Delhi roads with so many flyovers and underpasses.

Now Congress is set to release their first set of the posters attacking itself. If the response is good they plan to come out with more anti-self posters.

“Ajay Maken ji will personally paste those posters behind every auto in Delhi today,” revealed Maken.

When asked how Congress stands to gain through this tactic, Maken said that Congress was not just going to stop at that, but will also apologize for the mistakes highlighted in the posters.

“Dilli ki janta ka dil bahut bada hai ji. Woh kisi ko bhi maaf kar deti hai ji,” Maken revealed how Congress intends to get sympathy votes by playing victim card.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/congress-650_020415074310.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/frustrated-with-no-one-targeting-it-congress-to-attack-itself-in-the-last-few-days-of-delhi-election-campaign-7338,"Frustrated with no one targeting it, Congress to attack itself in the last few days of Delhi election campaign",,1423038832.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/adam-and-eve-were-bjp-agents-claims-kejriwal-7328,"New Delhi. “Adam and Eve, first humans of the universe were agents of BJP,” claimed Aam Aadmi Party convener Mr. Arvind Kejriwal while he was addressing reporters at a press briefing in connection with the forthcoming assembly elections in Delhi. They could also be agents of Ambani, he added for good measure.

The reporters were shocked by his startling claim and pointed out to the impossibility of this eventuality, but Arvind Kejriwal insisted that his claim was backed by evidence. He went on to present the evidence.

“Adam and Eve did not belong to Garden of Eden, they did not establish it or nurture it. They did not give their blood and sweat for making it grow big and green. They were just para-dropped into this garden against the wishes of other animals. Now, all of us know that this, para-dropping of leaders happens in BJP only. It is BJP which promotes such VIP culture. They had no respect for other animals just like they don’t have any respect for aam aadmi today.”

Despite this high inflation, how were they eating apple?

“Second proof lies in the apple. Can you tell me, in this period of high inflation, when an aam aadmi cannot even afford potatos and tomatoes, how were Adam and Eve eating an apple? How is this possible without having black money? Something is wrong, somewhere! Someone has taken a bribe, a lot of it!”

“Third piece of evidence is in the fact that while God severely punished the serpent and let Adam & Eve off lightly. This is the proof that all, including judiciary at that time were involved in this game of looting the poor. You would remember how I was jailed for a week because I called Gadkari corrupt. Now tell me, in which government’s rule the corrupt roam around in luxury cars and those who protest against corruption go to jail? Such situation can only happen when BJP are in government.”

“Fourth proof is that the offspring of Adam & Eve were two in number, called Cain and Abel. Is it a coincidence that Ambanis brothers too are two in number? This clearly establishes the connection of Ambanis with Adam and Eve.”

“We are getting more evidence of BJP’s involvement in tempting Adam and Eve on the path of sin. We have received information that the serpent was Amit Shah’s agent and his punishment was only a drama. A BJP leader who does not like the corruption in his party has agreed to provide us the video of the meeting between Amit Shah and the serpent. We would expose BJP completely.”

With this Mr. Kejriwal concluded the press briefing. The reporters did not ask any questions as they had been informed about Mr. Kejriwal’s aversion to anyone else asking questions.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kejriwal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/adam-and-eve-were-bjp-agents-claims-kejriwal-7328,"Adam and Eve were BJP agents, claims Kejriwal",,1422945106.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a strange incident that took place in Ashok Vihar area of North Delhi, two brothers who had separated 20 years ago during Kumbh Mela, got united once again thanks to aggressive door to door campaigning happening in Delhi for upcoming elections.

It all happened when Sharad Narang, an AAP volunteer knocked on the door of Vinod Narang, a known BJP supporter, late evening yesterday.

“Reading Narang nameplate outside the kothi, I was thinking to myself that like Kejriwal sir tried to woo entire baniya community by using his caste, I too would be able to establish some rapport and relation with those in the house, but was utterly shocked to find, I already have a relation with the man standing in front of me,” revealed Sharad.

Definitely not brothers.

But the BJP supporting brother says he wasn’t surprised with having found his AAP volunteer brother through this manner.

“I knew this insane level door to door campaigning that was happening all around was my best chance to meet my long lost brother and was at door to receive everyone for last few days,” Vinod told Faking News.

As soon as the news of brother’s unison became viral, both AAP and BJP jumped to take credit for it.

“Its correct that both of them got united. But yeh bhi toh bataiye ki gaya kaun ji? Pahal kisne ki ji?” asked Kejriwal as he made way to hug both brothers out of nowhere.

“It was the AAP volunteer who went to the house of BJP supporter. It shows that AAP is a party that takes initiatives to do things correctly and sets the agenda,” added the local AAP MLA who pounced on anybody who hailed destiny for brother’s unison.

“Toh Kya hua? Ghar ke darwaaze kisne khole, yeh batao. It was the BJP supporter. It clearly shows how open we are to new thoughts, people, ideas etc,” said Satish Upadhyay, BJP President, who too left the rally he was in midway to come to Ashok Vihar.

After this, local MLAs of both the parties started pulling up arms of both the brother’s towards themselves to get them on their side.

It was only after both brothers, (who were completely shocked by how the focus had shifted from their unison to political upmanship) threatened to vote for Congress that leader of both the parties stopped pulling their arms and left the place.

Meanwhile wary of the way aggressive campaigning is happening, a resident of Paschim Puri has locked himself in his newly rented room till elections are over.

“With the way unisons are happening, I am scared of being united with my lenders,” said Deepak (name changed).",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/modi-kejri.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/brothers-separated-at-kumbh-meet-during-door-to-door-campaign-for-delhi-elections-7322,"Brothers separated at Kumbh, meet during door to door campaign for Delhi elections",,1422870291.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Out of favor with the electorate, out of fear of a complete wash-out & out of sheer lack of any other option, Delhi Congress committee has taken to the tried & tested route to salvage some of its lost pride.

When opinion polls across the board have written the party off, as a last resort and some ingenuous creativity the party has brought on board Kaul, a great grandson of the great Oracle, Paul, the octopus to provide a constituency wise prediction of its chances of winning a seat.

Congress’ last ray of hope in the Delhi elections

The idea was a brainchild of Mr. Ajay Maken, the party’s face of the sporadic Congress one finds in the city. A spokesperson confirmed the news saying, “The opinion polls predicted gloom for the party, we needed to be like the ‘party with a difference’. Plus the accuracy of such polls are always doubtful, so Mr. Maken thought why not dare to think beyond such polls and in came the idea about Paul. Sadly, due to the unfortunate demise of the great soul, we requested the owner to provide us with someone from the same lineage. This is how Kaul has come into our office.”

Boris, trainer of Kaul laments, “This is such a futile exercise. I don’t know what am I going to teach this octopus. I don’t know who Paul was, I’ve been told to teach Kaul to dip into three jars of food containing flags of BJP, Congress and AAP & get him to develop the liking for Congress flag. These guys think since he has the same DNA as Paul, Kaul would be equally successful.”

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra didn’t waste an opportunity to take a dig at Congress, “This is a proof of Congress being a dynastic party. Why could they not get Kamla, the cow for the job? We are a party with meritocracy & I assure you if and when we do get someone to predict, it will do a better job than Kaul. Do you need more proof than the results of the last election?”

Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal lead AAP has already released posters asking voters the question – Whose prediction do you think is more ‘HONEST’ – Kaul, the Octopus or Yogendra Yadav?",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Octopus.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-recruits-paul-the-octopus-kin-to-predict-a-favorable-verdict-in-the-delhi-polls-7318,Congress recruits Paul the Octopus' kin to predict a favorable verdict in the Delhi polls,,1422771584.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after former minister Jayanthi Natarajan balmed Rahul Gandhi for asking her to resign from her post just before Lok Sabha elections without giving any exact reasons, Congress Vice President attacked back by claiming that it was a kind of test, which Jayanthi failed miserably.

Elaborating his claims, Rahul Gandhi revealed that he was expecting Jayanthi Natarajan to use RTI to know why exactly she was asked to resign.

“She doesn’t know when to use RTI, Congress is better without her”

“I keep testing IQ of leaders around me by creating situations around them, as I hate being surrounded by people with lower IQ. Plus, you know my feelings for RTI and how badly back in summers of 2014 I was in love with it. So, just to make sure that other senior Congress leaders are also in love with RTI and know its importance, I thought to mix IQ test with RTI,” said Rahul Gandhi explaining his side of the story.

Adding further, Rahul said that for last 11 months, he was waiting for Jayanthi to ask him the reason why she was asked to resign, but through an RTI inquiry.

“All she had to do was to say, ‘I want to know this thing under my right to information,’ that’s all. But unfortunately, that never clicked in her mind. I think she is a bit slow,” Rahul continued, “Everyone can’t be Digvijay uncle.”

Reportedly, once Rahul Gandhi took spectacles of Digvijay Singh and hid it on the table in front of him. But Digvijay Singh, instead of directly asking, ‘Where are my spectacles Rahul Ji’, handled the situation smartly and said, “Rahul Ji, under RTI, I want to know where are my spectacles.”

“Jayanthi Ji never had that spark of natural intelligence, all she kept doing was following my orders, like a robot and I am bored of playing with robots,” Rahul Gandhi told Faking News, “It is good that she has left the party. Our average IQ has increased.”

When asked if it was not against his other pet idea of “Women Empowerment” to force Jayanthi Natarajan to resign, Rahul Gandhi asked this reporter to file an RTI to get the answer.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rahul-Gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayanthi-ji-could-have-used-rti-to-know-why-she-was-asked-to-resign-it-was-an-iq-test-rahul-gandhi-7310,"Jayanthi Ji could have used RTI to know why she was asked to resign, it was an IQ test : Rahul Gandhi",,1422613874.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Dismissing suggestions that he himself found Kiran Bedi (who they now claim a BJP mole in JanLokpal movement) better suited for CM responsibility, Kejriwal claims that the offer to make her CM stood only for 49 days.

Kiran Bedi asking Kejriwal to keep a file of Narendra Modi’s governance, if he wants her to be CM.

“As you know my patience levels are very short and nothing holds my attention beyond 49 days, same was the case while making on offer to Kiran ji last year. Do you really think I would have let her remain CM beyond that,” Kejriwal told Faking News, rubbishing Bedi’s accusation that Kejriwal trusted her more than himself.

“Even if I had not resigned on 14th Feb, the plan was that I would take over after 49 days and would be the CM for next 49 days. Then Manish Sisodia, Somnath Bharti, and so on. This way every AAP MLA in Delhi and maybe even few AAP supporters would have got a chance to be Delhi CM,” he went on to reveal AAP’s plan last year.

“You see I was not lying, when I said CM main nahi hoon ji, balki aap log hain ji,” he pointed as to how he was not megalomaniac.

However some AAP insiders also claim that Kejriwal was not cheating Delhi voters this way as irrespective of anyone who sat on CM’s chair , Kejriwal would have actually run the affairs, just Sonia Gandhi controlled PM’s chair for 10 years.

Claiming that his offer is still open, Kejriwal asked Kiran Bedi to again reconsider his offer.

“With BJP set to lose badly this time, she has no chance, but if she joins AAP, she will at least get to be CM for few days,” he said as he lured Bedi for one last time.

As per our sources, talks between the BJP leadership and the Obamas have been going on ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S. last September. Michelle Obama will be the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming Delhi elections.

“Hello Dilli”

Looks like BJP wasn’t very confident of Kiran Bedi winning the assembly elections for them. A senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, told us, “The party leadership was worried about the possibility of another hung assembly, which would cause a depreciation in the speed of propagation and energy density of the Modi wave.”

When asked why they are roping in Michelle Obama for the job rather than giving a chance to their own deserving candidates such as Shazia Ilmi, he exclaimed, “We are not content with #CheckmateAAP. We want #FlawlessVictoryBJP to trend on twitter.”

This might come as a shock to Kiran Bedi who was unavailable for a comment. Although she is not the only BJP leader unhappy with the developments. Sakshi Maharaj and his supporters have raised their voices against this move. They are reportedly unhappy with the fact that Michelle Obama has only two children, half the count required for a woman to ascertain her worth.

No AAP leader in the capital was available for a comment while the party workers were still digging the internet for the screenshots of Kiran Bedi’s deleted anti-BJP tweets. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Washington unit is planning on a dharna outside the White House, demanding a probe into how Barack Obama is using the taxpayers’ money to travel to India for personal gains.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-announces-n-srinivasan-as-its-cm-candidate-for-delhi-bjp-and-aap-withdraw-7251,"New Delhi: BJP and AAP are fighting against each other while not giving an iota of attention to the third party that once ruled Delhi – Congress. Congress introduced Ajay Maken, but he was never taken for debates or was never shown the mike by news channels.

Dejected by this unpopularity, Congress tried to cash in on the Bedi factor by stating that Mandira Bedi is their CM candidate. However, she too rejected that offer.

Now Congress has gone for a masterstroke – it has announced that BCCI boss N Srinivasan will be its Chief Ministerial candidate in Delhi elections.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had barred Srinivasan from contesting BCCI elections. Congress offered Srini Mama to contest Delhi elections, and he readily agreed.

Congress has already started putting up posters and banners anointing Srini as CM. These posters (one such in the image above) were plastered on areas where Obama will visit while in Delhi.

This news has sent ripples across the political spectrum. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) both are shell shocked.

According to sources, Kiran Bedi ran up to Amit Shah asking to cancel her nomination, while Kejriwal took his Wagon-R car to take continuous U-Turns outside the Election Commission office.

On the other hand, after six months of slumber, Congress workers in Delhi were seen celebrating this announcement with crackers and distributing sweets and thanking Rahul Gandhi’s vision.

“As far as the elections across the world are concerned, N Srinivasan is the only person who has never lost in any elections. His name never came up in the voters list, but it will always appear in the candidates list,” an expert explained the reactions of political parties.

Sources tell Faking News that Shazia Imli, Vinod Binny, and many defectors from AAP to BJP are now ready to take another jump to Congress.

“I find myself back to home at Congress. They always say that your first jump might be of short duration, but the third company you land in will be your permanent one. I feel like that,” Shazia Ilmi tweeted.

The left-outs in AAP like Yogendra Yavad and Ashish Khaten too are headed to join Congress, sources confirm. “The only thing that kept them away from Congress was because Congress had started losing. Now with Srini Mama at helm, there is no reason,” a source revealed.

With these ground shaking developments, BJP and AAP have decided not to contest Delhi elections. Kiran Bedi is planning to start a fresh reality show on TV, while Kejriwal has requested Anna Hazare to give him another chance. BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi was seen taking selfies with his posters that were plastered across Delhi by AAP.

Ever since AAP founder and mentor Shanti Bhushan called Kiran Bedi as a better Chief Ministerial candidate than Arvind Kejriwal, people in AAP circles had gone into an overdrive collecting corruption charges and allegations against him.

However unable to gather their standard 300 pages of corruption evidence against Bhushan Sr even after 24 hours since his comment, has created a state of panic in AAP headquarters.

Shanti Bhushan preferring to stand closer to Bedi than Kejriwal, a proof he was always with corrupt BJP, insisted AAP.

Leaders have started doubting their capabilities and wondering if they have lost the midas touch of just about labeling and proving anyone corrupt.

“Are we losing it? Do we now have it in us to get a 300 page corruption proof against anyone and everyone as and when the need demands,” wondered Manish Sisodia as he went into an introspective drive.

Sources tell Faking News that brains at AAP tried many things to achieve the feat. But even after taking corruption of Shanti’s close friends, relatives, neighbours, etc into consideration, AAP was unable to take the figure up to 300 pages.

“Even Prashant being a true AAPian agreed to sacrifice his own image for party’s sake and offered proofs of some corruption he did while submitting fake petrol bills during his time as lawyer in a private firm, but still the figure did not touch 300,” revealed an AAP insider.

“At one point we were so depressed that, we thought of shortening the size of each page. But still couldn’t touch the magical figure,” he went on to disclose.

Some AAP volunteers even dig up an old piece of Shanti Bhushan where he had criticized Kejriwal, as a proof that Bhushan was always corrupt from beginning, but senior leaders asked them to forget it as people may have also forgotten about it.

Now AAP is in the process of setting up a chance encounter between Shanti Bhushan and some industrialist already declared corrupt by AAP like Adani, Ambani etc.

Police was called in after a riot broke out between two rival groups in front of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Office. The reason for the riot has left both the party & the authority bewildered.

Two known rival Congress leaders had taken out rallies in support of each other to be awarded the party ticket from Rohini constituency in Delhi for the upcoming legislative assembly elections. In normal times, the scenes would have been different with the rival claiming to get tickets for themselves. But times have changed as it stands today.

So much love

Neelkamal Rathi and Vijay Dahiya, 2 leaders from the party have been political rivals for generations. Sources tell Faking News that their buffaloes too refuse to give milk if it wanders to the rival’s territory. So it did appear to be a pleasant surprise when Neelkamal openly requested the party to give ticket to Vijay.

What Neelkamal had claimed was, “Abki baari, Vijay karega bhains sawaari” (This time, Vijay will ride the buffalo). This some claimed was a jovial reference to ride to the Legislative Assembly.

However, things are not what they seem. In a flash, Vijay Dahiya came out in support of Neelkamal, “High command se badi vinati hai, Neelkama tau ko banao ummedwaar, is baar” (I request the party high-command to nominate Neelkamal Uncle as the party candidate, this time).

While this show of brotherhood was surprising, it was almost amusing to observe this goodwill between two rivals. However as faith had it, this was no show of friendship but a deeply sinister ploy to get even one more time while their party lay in coma.

It is now come to light that both candidates knowing that chances of Congress winning the elections were less than Taliban turning to Gandhigiri, they were under no situation willing to get tickets to contest. Also since the loss of anyone contesting on a Congress ticket was divinely sealed by Lord Brahma himself, they wanted to get even with each other. Hence both took out processions in support of each other to the Party Headquarters where this so-called bonhomie was exposed.

A party insider on conditions of anonymity disclosed, “These candidates are treating the party as aged parents whom none of the brothers want to keep at their place.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Fight.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fight-in-front-of-congress-office-between-2-rival-groups-to-give-the-ticket-to-each-other-7238,Fight in front of Congress office between 2 rival groups to give the ticket to each other,,1422000017.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

To add fuel to the fire, she left the Arnab’s den or rather ran away from Newshour studio before Arnab turned into a Hulk. This paved way for the term ‘Bhagoda’ to be extended from Kejriwal to Bedi also and she was mocked as ‘I-run’ woman. But, the AAP fans are now shocked with Kiran using it as political masterstroke and challenging Kejriwal for running.

Throwing the challenge at Kejriwal on Twitter, Bedi has asked him for a race from 10 Janpath Road to 7 Race Course Road. Kejriwal, who was shocked by the challenge has been forced by many of his supporters to accept this challenge as they are confident of his ‘running’ skills.

Bedi and Kejriwal looking at Ajay Maken and asking “Aapko kisne bulaya race ke liye?”

The date has been set for after Obama leaves Delhi so that there will not be much traffic restriction then. Security experts were relieved after the date announcement, because they were scared that AAP supporters might ruin all their arrangements for Obama’s visit.

We met with an expert to have some clarifications on this peculiar challenge. She said, “This is a political masterstroke from Kiran Bedi. She is a trained police officer and even in this age, due to her strict exercise and dietary regimen, she can run without losing much stamina. But, on the other side, Kejriwal has seasonal cough and he can easily catch illness when exposed to the chills of Delhi air. That is why, he is always seen sporting muffler during winters. This muffler will be heavy load when he runs and will impede his momentum. All in all, this can be a sureshot victory for Bedi ma’am, but her supporters should not keep Modi’s posters in her track. Or else, she will stop wherever she sees one poster and start admiring the beautiful face.“

When asked over the relationship between politics and running, she added, “See, Kejriwal is a known runner. He ran away from Janata Darbar, ran away from CM post, ran away from egg-stone-ink throwers. So, this politics has made him more an athletic than an anarchist. Bedi is a police officer and she has ran behind rioters during her service. If one could prove that they can run fully taking care of their energy levels without being distracted, they can claim that they can run the government too successfully. If you can run in the roads, why can’t you run the roads?”

Meanwhile, sources close to Kejriwal revealed that, he is planning to stop in the starting point itself and claim that “Congress -BJP bhai bhai ji, so 10 Janpath is same as 7 RCR and hence I won the race.”‘",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bedi-kejriwal_759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rejecting-the-invite-for-a-debate-kiran-bedi-challenges-arvind-kejriwal-for-a-race-7234,"Rejecting the invite for a debate, Kiran Bedi challenges Arvind Kejriwal for a race",,1421924585.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After criticizing Kiran Bedi and asking her to not politicize and saffronize freedom fighters, when she put a saffron scarf around Lala Lajpat Rai’s statue in Krishna Nagar, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has now dismissed suggestions that AAP too has chosen that route many a times in the past.

When pointed that so many AAP leaders and he himself had in the past compared themselves with Bhagat Singh, Kejriwal argued that Bhagat Singh wasn’t initially a freedom fighter, and that his real profession was something else.

Kejriwal claims that Bhagat Singh’s shirt’s pocket in his photo was always clipped, because it had a pen, and that there was a BJP/RSS conspiracy behind it

“I don’t think Bhagat Singh ji was a freedom fighter. I have strong evidence that proves that he was a supremely talented dialogue writer,” Kejriwal said as he flashed 300 pages of Bhagat Singh quotes in front of media.

Strengthening his claims further he pointed, “Have you heard this dialogue ‘Janta hoon aap meri shaadi karwana chahte hai, par meri dulhan to aazadi hai’ and many other similar gems. Don’t think any freedom fighter can come up with such awesome dialogues.”

Kejriwal further argued that not many people were aware of this fact simply because there was no RTI back then and also because Bhagat Singh was only a struggling Bollywood writer.

“It was his pain of not making it big in Hindi film industry, despite being so talented that he took up freedom fighting later, hoping to get his due in an independent India,” Kejriwal claimed, “And he used the lines that he composed as a writer, as a tool to fight against Britishers.”

“So obviously if my party members or I have ever tried comparing myself with him, always remember, the comparison was with Bhagat Singh ‘the writer’ and not Bhagat Singh ‘the freedom fighter’ that we know,” he concluded claiming that his party always does thorough professional background check before comparing itself with any legends.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-project-mandira-bedi-as-its-delhi-cm-candidate-7228,"New Delhi. Due to the elections turning into a popularity contest which is heating up in Delhi, Congress has planned to bring in Mandira Bedi to contest for the CM’s seat.

“Popularity contest? We will challenge them for a fashion contest!” said rare Congress supporter, “We also wanted someone who has both of the best qualities of the other candidates. Mandira has the last name of Kiran and she has come more times on TV than Arvind Kejriwal. Both qualities in one person? Checkmate!”

Unlike Kiran, this Bedi has all the support from Congress leaders, specially those from Youth Wing.

Mandira Bedi who was in Australia watching the Tri series was contacted by members of the Congress party who wanted her to immediately fly to India to contest in the elections. Since India was playing badly, Congress leaders assumed that she has a better chance of winning the elections with Congress than watching India win the tri-series.

“She is the perfect candidate for us. Due to constant travelling I heard that she even got a cough which brings the quality of Kejriwal here,” said a supporter, “Kejriwal is challenging everyone for a public debate? We will challenge him for a public ramp walk.”

Many Congress supporting techies have raised slogans such as “MB = 1024 KB”, “MB > KB” referring to Mandira Bedi (MB) and Kiran Bedi (KB). Other congress supporters have supported the slogan hoping that some people will vote for them based on the innovation of the slogan at least.

“Mandira ji was a fashion model who has over 100,000 fans in Facebook,” said a supporter, “We will definitely get all those votes. And to be frank, we have not included her twitter followers yet…”

Rahul Gandhi seemed to be very happy with the recommendation and mentioned that this will be his first step taken to empower women. When informed that even the previous Delhi CM was a woman, he looked puzzled for a second and commented that both women are from the pre-RTI and post-RTI era which are very different and complicated to explain. He further went on to explain the theory of relativity that he researched about during his time in Harvard and its possible uses in Indian politics.

Unfortunately for the supporters, Mandira Bedi has replied that she is not interested to contest in the Delhi elections or any politics for that matter.

Since thousands of posters saying “MB > KB” are already printed, Congress supporters are desperately searching for a candidate with initials MB to contest in the Delhi elections with assurances of getting free food (guaranteed butter chicken or biryani), accommodation and travel allowances till it gets over.

Soon after rejecting Arvind Kejriwal’s offer to have a pre-poll public debate, BJP CM candidate and ex-IPS officer Kiran Bedi said that instead she wanted to interrogate Kejriwal for whatever he had done in the last one year.

Speaking at a press conference, Bedi also confessed that her habit of interrogating was a side effect of her 40 year long service as an IPS officer.

Interrogation room offered by Delhi Police.

“I am not habituated of debating with my opponents. But now that I have joined politics, I guess slowly I will get rid of this old habit,” said Kiran Bedi.

However, she is hopeful that down the line she will become a normal politician. “The transition is definitely not easy, but when I look at Kejriwal, I get the feeling that it’s not impossible,” Bedi continued.

Adding further, Bedi said, in around a month she would be able to completely get out of cop mode and hopefully would be ready for debate, and precisely that was the reason why she told Kejriwal that she would debate on the floor of assembly.

In a month, Bedi is expecting to master all the tricks a politician is required to learn before appearing in a public political debate.

“She is yet to learn a lot from party spokespersons who know this art of holding their ground no matter how adverse the situation is, during a debate. Kejriwal has very well mastered this art, but Kiran madam, who is just four days old in the politics, has still a lot to learn,” said Bedi’s close aide explaining why Kejriwal was feeling more confident.

“As of now, Kiran madam is more confident about her police officer skills than her political skill sets and she is quite sure that at a public interrogation, she will make Kejriwal reveal why he actually resigned from the Delhi CM post,” Bedi’s aide told Faking News.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police has offered an interrogation room to provide perfect ambience for the high-profile interrogation, while many news channels are ready to broadcast it live.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Interrogation-Room.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/instead-of-debating-bedi-wants-to-interrogate-kejriwal-says-will-take-time-to-get-rid-of-old-habits-7224,"Instead of debating, Bedi wants to interrogate Kejriwal, says will take time to get rid of old habits",,1421749611.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after BJP announced Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate for Delhi, donors to Aam Aadmi Party demanded return of the money that AAP wasted in getting ‘Kejriwal vs Mukhi’ posters made.

It should be recalled that right after Delhi legislative assembly was dissolved in November last year, AAP had itself nominated BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi as BJP’s CM candidate and pitted Kejriwal against him in posters that were printed and pasted on Autos across Delhi.

Enraged with yesterday’s development, AAP donors took to social networking sites asking Kejriwal & Co to return their money.

Just a show piece now.

“I have been told that AAP spent more than 70% of overall donations received in getting those posters made. A true baniya would never do that,” one such donor told Faking News.

“We don’t donate money to AAP so that they end up spending it on such unproductive things. Earlier a substantial amount of our money was wasted in forfeiting deposit by AAP in Lok Sabha elections and now this. I think its high time we demand the money back and know where it is being spent,” said a rare logical AAP supporter.

While some hardcore AAP supporters lambasted donors demanding their money back and labelled them Bedi agents.

“Had they been true AAPians, instead of questioning AAP, they would have got down to streets and modified those posters by sketching Kiran Bedi’s face instead of Jagdish Mukhi,” tweeted @AAPbeforeBAAP.

However already falling short of donations this time around, Kejriwal has expressed his inability to return the money and has appealed to his donors to take bribes from BJP and Congress, to make up for their loss.

Meanwhile Mukhi has requested AAP to not take off those posters from Autos and other places.

“I am grateful to AAP for giving me the status that even my party did not bother to give me after all these years. I think this is the closest I can ever come to being a CM. I don’t want to let go off this feeling,” Mukhi said as tears rolled down his eyes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/0.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-donors-demand-return-of-money-wasted-by-aap-on-making-kejriwal-vs-jagdish-mukhi-posters-7222,AAP donors demand return of money wasted by AAP on making 'Kejriwal vs Jagdish Mukhi' posters,,1421742937.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Faced with a string of party hopping witnessed among politicians in the run up to the Delhi polls, BJP has hired an HR consultancy firm to take care of their political recruitment.

The party, which is a current favorite of politicians cutting across spectrum of corruption, through its spokesperson confirmed the development, “We generally do not have an issue with a leader changing parties too frequently. Our worry is when media tracks down their past comments, videos and tweets, it becomes difficult to justify. Though we are experts at appearing as shameless in the public life, Saheb insists good PR is essential & critical for achhe din.”

“It’s perfectly logical”

With the election scene heating up in Delhi, there is a mad last minute rush among parties and leaders alike to grab market (sic vote) share.

An insider view well known in the political circles is that politics is unlike a government job where one can retire after not working at all for 30-40yrs.

Local Delhi residents are neither concerned nor amused by this development.

Shree Ram Gupta a resident of Rohini said, “aisa hee hai jaise pehle unhone Red Line buses ka naam badal kar Blue Line kar diya tha. Red line bhi kukhyat thee, aur Blue Line bhi. Kuch nahi badla, sirf naam. Ye Neta log bhi waise hee hote hain” (It’s like when they changed the name of Red Line buses to Blue Line buses in Delhi – notorious were the red ones, and so were the blue ones – nothing changed just the name. These politicians are also the same).

On being asked, whether he would vote for the same guy in a different party, Gupta Ji had a little piece of philosophy for us, “Beta, rajniti mein bhi daag achhe hote hain.” (Son, even in politics, dirt is good), obviously referring to the catch line of a popular detergent powder.

Shazia Ilmi, a new recruit by the party agrees, “This is such a huge media conspiracy. The moment I intended to hop parties, these people just dug up my past tweets condemning the leadership. Well, even we politicians are professionals and have an equal right to join a party that has better fortunes. It’s just like say when brand manager of Coke joins Pepsi, he will prostrate himself in front of Pepsi can even when he had earlier been overtly critical of it. There’s nothing personal to it.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ilmi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-hires-hr-consultancy-firm-to-train-party-hoppers-in-the-art-of-facing-the-media-2-7206,BJP hires HR consultancy firm to train party hoppers in the art of facing the media,,1421565362.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Congress’ Delhi election campaign head Ajay Maken today claimed that it was for the same reason that he wasn’t really worried about Narendra Modi ignoring Congress and targeting only AAP during his Ramlila Maidan rally.

Maken showing the number of seats he alone will win in Delhi.

“The fight is not at all about who will win. That is almost given that Congress is winning. The fight is for runners up position. And for that I agree both BJP and AAP are strong contenders and there is a close fight,” a confident Ajay Maken told Faking News.

He claimed that both AAP and BJP have already conceded defeat by not even talking about congress.

“They may not show it, but they too like voters agree that Congress ruled Delhi well for 15 years and that it’s tried and trusted, and are hence only attacking each other,” said Maken.

Maken further pointed to virtually no campaigning by Congress as another sign of how confident party was of emerging victorious in Delhi.

“That’s why Rahul Ji and Sonia Ji are not even doing any rallies in Delhi. It’s as pointless as India cricket team practicing before a match against Kenya,” Maken explained.

“Therefore instead of wasting time, they are already planning about the development work that we will do once we are back to power in Delhi,” Maken further revealed.

When asked that if Congress was so confident of its win in Delhi, why did ex CM Sheila Dixit say that Congress may again support AAP, Maken shot back, “You got it wrong. Sheila Ji was only talking about giving emotional support to AAP once they are declared losers posts elections. You see in last few months, no other party has faced so many defeats as much as we have. It’s our moral duty to help other using that experience.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Maken_Bats_For_7508.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-and-aap-targetting-each-other-only-for-second-place-in-delhi-elections-congress-7180,BJP and AAP targetting each other only for second place in Delhi elections: Congress,,1421306277.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

BJP leaders like Sakshi Maharaj & Shyamal Goswami who are continuously asking Hindus to have more and more kids have assured people to not worry about space crunch in already overpopulated India, as they are working on “Interstellar” type mission to find a planet to accommodate extra Hindus.

BJP leader from West Bengal Shyamal Goswami was addressing a joint press conference with Sakshi Maharaj explaining why they think asking Hindu women to have five children is not that bad idea.

“Baaki ke liye main hoon na“

“Don’t think that we are short-sighted, and saying whatever we want to say. Me, Sakshi Maharaj Ji and many others who believe in what we are saying are working on a space project to find habitable planets where we will be shifting extra Hindus, once we will run out of space in India,” said Shyamal Goswami adding that everything is preplanned.

As per Mr. Goswami, VHP is helping them with the secret knowledge of aerodynamics that they have, and in the next couple of years they are expecting their spacecraft capable of traveling across galaxies to get ready.

“One of our team is even working on creation of a wormhole, which will help our spacecraft to move to different space time zone,” Shyamal Goswami further added comparing their effort to build a wormhole with what of Ram Setu, “No hindrance will be able to stop us from creating universe’s first Hindu-Grah.”

Talking more about the issue, Sakshi Maharaj said, all they wanted was that people concentrate on what they have been asked to do.

“In short, we don’t want Hindus to waste their time thinking about minor details like where their children would be living and what would they eat. We just want them to focus on producing more and more babies, for rest, hum hain na,” commented Sakshi Maharaj requesting Hindus to not panic, “If all goes well, we will have enough space to accommodate 100 billion Hindus.”

Meanwhile, Zakir Naik, famous public speaker on the subject of Islam, mocked Right wing leaders for being too much hyper.

Eyeing victory in upcoming assembly elections in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party today announced that they would outsource the dharnas and drama, that they have become synonymous with, to concentrate on governance, if voted to power again.

It should be noted that Narendra Modi in his first rally in Delhi at Ramlila Madian had asked voters to let AAP do dharna which they are good at, while vote for BJP if they wanted development.

Although Kejriwal responded to this by claiming that they are pro at both staging dharnas and good governance, it was concluded in a meeting held by senior AAP leaders later, that they may compromise on one of these, if they took up both.

It was then decided by AAP that they would outsource the dharna, protests and drama, which would continue to be an integral part of their 49 days 5 year rule, to some third party.

Kejriwal wondering if governance would be as easy as dharnas.

“Frankly speaking, we have become addicted to it. It would be difficult to not resort to drama and do dharnas at the drop of a hat, but I want to assure people of Delhi that if voted again, we would only concentrate on good governance at least for the 5 year term that we get,” said Yogendra Yadav, “After we have made Delhi a world class city, maybe we will go back to dharna.”

“On second thoughts, I would be glad if after few hard days of serious work, a dharna once in a while by us, on a government holiday, is taken in good spirit by Delhi citizens,” he hoped.

Yogendra however disclosed that suggestion to outsource governance and concentrate on their core competency Dharna, was also floated in the meeting, but it was decided that it would be no challenge to do what they are already good at.

When asked if they have short listed any entity, whom they would outsource, AAP revealed that they were mighty impressed with fringe Hindu groups of late and may just finalize them.

“As far as drama is concerned, they should be able to handle it quite well, with the aid of print and electronic media, but we have doubts if they have it in them to be good dharnamen and anarchists as well,” wondered Somnath Bharti ruing the lack of good alternatives AAP has, when it comes to theatrics.

“But even if they manage to be half as good a night raiders as I was, we shall be happy,” he added.

Elaborating further on how the whole set up would work, Kejriwal said both governance and dharnas would happen simultaneously in the national capital.

“If these fringe Hindu groups run out of material to create ‘hungama’ on, we at AAP would then step in, have a brain storming session with them, before finalizing on issues that can be taken up for the day,” Kejriwal told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kejriwal-dharna.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-outsource-dharna-protests-and-drama-to-concentrate-on-governance-if-voted-to-power-in-delhi-again-7150,"AAP to outsource dharna, protests and drama to concentrate on governance if voted to power in Delhi again",,1421137748.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With just one month to go for elections in Delhi, Delhi BJP’s election strategy has come under sever scrutiny from engineering students across the country; who have accused the party’s Delhi unit of blatantly copying their last minute preparation strategy.

“Going by the way they are relaxing at the moment, with just one month way from fresh elections, its quite apparent they are copying our strategy, that too without giving us any credit,” a 22 year old 2nd year engineering student told Faking News, “At least they should have acknowledged us.”

Munching samosas and doing time pass, when they should be aggressively campaigning.

“They seem to have only now woken up to the fact that there will be elections soon and it’s only now that we are seeing some activity from their end,” he further pointed.

“But they are still only making plans and more plans; like we do every night and I don’t see any seriousness and urgency of those plans getting executed anytime soon,” he concluded.

It’s not just Delhi BJP’s deliberate dilly dallying campaigning till eleventh hour that has caught engineering students’ attention, but they point to other similarities as well to strengthen their claims.

“The very fact that they have not even announced list of candidates for any constituency is very similar to us not purchasing even text books till few days before exams,” pointed a senior engineering student, who is planning to sue Delhi BJP for plagiarizing.

“Also the fact that they are getting overconfident due to good performance in other state elections is similar to us remaining perpetually overconfident because of our good results in 10th, 12th and entrance exams,” he added.

Sakshi Maharaj, BJP MP from Unnao who recently said that every Hindu woman must produce four children, is now planning to take the matter in his own hands by setting up a test tube baby production factory to produce Hindu babies on mass level.

Sakshi Maharaj was shocked to see the backlash which he was facing for his comment, even from the Hindu section of the society.

Expected glimpse of a baby godown

“If people don’t want to participate, it’s fine. I have found a way to achieve what I want,” said the parliamentarian revealing his grand plan to set up a baby production factory in the outskirts of Delhi, “I can’t wait for others, as it’s getting too late. Population of Hindus is shrinking day by day and all these people are caring about is giving proper education, food and health facility to their children. They need to be more rough and tough.”

Sakshi Maharaj is aiming to flood market with Hindu babies in the next three years.

“I am pro-industrialization. All I am doing is trying to boost Hindu population growth using available technologies,” Sakshi Maharaj continued.

“Make in India,” he said, as he announced making Hindu babies in the factory.

Anand Tiwari, a close aide of Sakshi Maharaj revealed that they were expecting first production batch to be delivered by May 2016.

“If all goes well, by May 2016 our factory will produce around 50000 Hindu babies,” said Mr. Tiwari adding that as of now they are concentrating on hiring women who are ready to carry fertilized eggs inside them, and people who are ready to donate their sperms and eggs for fertilization, “And we are making sure that all of them are Hindus.”

Due to mass production level, a special nomenclature will be followed to name the babies. “For example, for babies born in year 2016, it will be like ‘Hindu Model Year 2016 X’, where X will be a number,” Anand Tiwari told Faking News.

On being asked what they would be doing with babies, Sakshi Maharaj said, “We will be having big godowns where we will keep them for first 10 years, after which we will set them free to live life on their own, as a proud Hindu.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Babies-300x163.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sakshi-maharaj-to-set-up-test-tube-baby-production-factory-to-produce-hindu-babies-on-mass-level-7115,"Sakshi Maharaj to set up ""Test tube baby production factory"" to produce Hindu babies on mass level",,1420630631.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“Why should boys have all the fun? “ he is reported to have said while claiming that merely impregnating wives was not enough hard work for men and they should do more to save Hinduism.

“It has come to my notice, that majority of Hindu men only pray on Tuesdays or when confronted with a difficult situation. This needs to be changed if Hinduism is to be saved in India,” the BJP MP from Unnao, said at a religious gathering in Meerut, “We must counter the concept of praying 5 times a day and Friday prayers with our own 15 prayers in a day and Tuesday havans.”

Sakshi showing Hindus how to pray with folded hands.

Calling this concept ‘Mandir Wapsi’, Sakshi Maharaj and his supporters would storm every Hindu household unannounced, make Hindu men in the house wear saffron outfits, hand them Gita and other religious text books, and forcefully take them to the nearest mandirs to make them perform pooja at least 15 times.

“They have an option of either performing these poojas in one go or they could even keep gaps in between,” Sakshi told Faking News.

“But it would be better if they help their wives their complete target of producing 4 kids during this gap,” he quickly added.

He further urged them to perform at least 2-3 of those prayers outside a Mosque or Church.

Maharaj further has plans for those Hindus who still manage to evade these poojas, by creating situations where they are forced to pray.

“We would give fake calls on their mobiles and scare them by saying stuff like his family members have met with an accident. I am sure on hearing this they would immediately start praying and thus complete their praying quota,” quipped Sakshi.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rejecting-the-invite-for-a-debate-kiran-bedi-challenges-arvind-kejriwal-for-a-race-7234,"New Delhi: Ever since Kejriwal called Kiran Bedi for a debate and she replied she would do so on floor of the house, critics have been slamming her.

To add fuel to the fire, she left the Arnab’s den or rather ran away from Newshour studio before Arnab turned into a Hulk. This paved way for the term ‘Bhagoda’ to be extended from Kejriwal to Bedi also and she was mocked as ‘I-run’ woman. But, the AAP fans are now shocked with Kiran using it as political masterstroke and challenging Kejriwal for running.

Throwing the challenge at Kejriwal on Twitter, Bedi has asked him for a race from 10 Janpath Road to 7 Race Course Road. Kejriwal, who was shocked by the challenge has been forced by many of his supporters to accept this challenge as they are confident of his ‘running’ skills.

Bedi and Kejriwal looking at Ajay Maken and asking “Aapko kisne bulaya race ke liye?”

The date has been set for after Obama leaves Delhi so that there will not be much traffic restriction then. Security experts were relieved after the date announcement, because they were scared that AAP supporters might ruin all their arrangements for Obama’s visit.

We met with an expert to have some clarifications on this peculiar challenge. She said, “This is a political masterstroke from Kiran Bedi. She is a trained police officer and even in this age, due to her strict exercise and dietary regimen, she can run without losing much stamina. But, on the other side, Kejriwal has seasonal cough and he can easily catch illness when exposed to the chills of Delhi air. That is why, he is always seen sporting muffler during winters. This muffler will be heavy load when he runs and will impede his momentum. All in all, this can be a sureshot victory for Bedi ma’am, but her supporters should not keep Modi’s posters in her track. Or else, she will stop wherever she sees one poster and start admiring the beautiful face.“

When asked over the relationship between politics and running, she added, “See, Kejriwal is a known runner. He ran away from Janata Darbar, ran away from CM post, ran away from egg-stone-ink throwers. So, this politics has made him more an athletic than an anarchist. Bedi is a police officer and she has ran behind rioters during her service. If one could prove that they can run fully taking care of their energy levels without being distracted, they can claim that they can run the government too successfully. If you can run in the roads, why can’t you run the roads?”

Meanwhile, sources close to Kejriwal revealed that, he is planning to stop in the starting point itself and claim that “Congress -BJP bhai bhai ji, so 10 Janpath is same as 7 RCR and hence I won the race.”‘",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bedi-kejriwal_759.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rejecting-the-invite-for-a-debate-kiran-bedi-challenges-arvind-kejriwal-for-a-race-7234,"Rejecting the invite for a debate, Kiran Bedi challenges Arvind Kejriwal for a race",,1421924585.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After criticizing Kiran Bedi and asking her to not politicize and saffronize freedom fighters, when she put a saffron scarf around Lala Lajpat Rai’s statue in Krishna Nagar, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has now dismissed suggestions that AAP too has chosen that route many a times in the past.

When pointed that so many AAP leaders and he himself had in the past compared themselves with Bhagat Singh, Kejriwal argued that Bhagat Singh wasn’t initially a freedom fighter, and that his real profession was something else.

Kejriwal claims that Bhagat Singh’s shirt’s pocket in his photo was always clipped, because it had a pen, and that there was a BJP/RSS conspiracy behind it

“I don’t think Bhagat Singh ji was a freedom fighter. I have strong evidence that proves that he was a supremely talented dialogue writer,” Kejriwal said as he flashed 300 pages of Bhagat Singh quotes in front of media.

Strengthening his claims further he pointed, “Have you heard this dialogue ‘Janta hoon aap meri shaadi karwana chahte hai, par meri dulhan to aazadi hai’ and many other similar gems. Don’t think any freedom fighter can come up with such awesome dialogues.”

Kejriwal further argued that not many people were aware of this fact simply because there was no RTI back then and also because Bhagat Singh was only a struggling Bollywood writer.

“It was his pain of not making it big in Hindi film industry, despite being so talented that he took up freedom fighting later, hoping to get his due in an independent India,” Kejriwal claimed, “And he used the lines that he composed as a writer, as a tool to fight against Britishers.”

“So obviously if my party members or I have ever tried comparing myself with him, always remember, the comparison was with Bhagat Singh ‘the writer’ and not Bhagat Singh ‘the freedom fighter’ that we know,” he concluded claiming that his party always does thorough professional background check before comparing itself with any legends.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-project-mandira-bedi-as-its-delhi-cm-candidate-7228,"New Delhi. Due to the elections turning into a popularity contest which is heating up in Delhi, Congress has planned to bring in Mandira Bedi to contest for the CM’s seat.

“Popularity contest? We will challenge them for a fashion contest!” said rare Congress supporter, “We also wanted someone who has both of the best qualities of the other candidates. Mandira has the last name of Kiran and she has come more times on TV than Arvind Kejriwal. Both qualities in one person? Checkmate!”

Unlike Kiran, this Bedi has all the support from Congress leaders, specially those from Youth Wing.

Mandira Bedi who was in Australia watching the Tri series was contacted by members of the Congress party who wanted her to immediately fly to India to contest in the elections. Since India was playing badly, Congress leaders assumed that she has a better chance of winning the elections with Congress than watching India win the tri-series.

“She is the perfect candidate for us. Due to constant travelling I heard that she even got a cough which brings the quality of Kejriwal here,” said a supporter, “Kejriwal is challenging everyone for a public debate? We will challenge him for a public ramp walk.”

Many Congress supporting techies have raised slogans such as “MB = 1024 KB”, “MB > KB” referring to Mandira Bedi (MB) and Kiran Bedi (KB). Other congress supporters have supported the slogan hoping that some people will vote for them based on the innovation of the slogan at least.

“Mandira ji was a fashion model who has over 100,000 fans in Facebook,” said a supporter, “We will definitely get all those votes. And to be frank, we have not included her twitter followers yet…”

Rahul Gandhi seemed to be very happy with the recommendation and mentioned that this will be his first step taken to empower women. When informed that even the previous Delhi CM was a woman, he looked puzzled for a second and commented that both women are from the pre-RTI and post-RTI era which are very different and complicated to explain. He further went on to explain the theory of relativity that he researched about during his time in Harvard and its possible uses in Indian politics.

Unfortunately for the supporters, Mandira Bedi has replied that she is not interested to contest in the Delhi elections or any politics for that matter.

Since thousands of posters saying “MB > KB” are already printed, Congress supporters are desperately searching for a candidate with initials MB to contest in the Delhi elections with assurances of getting free food (guaranteed butter chicken or biryani), accommodation and travel allowances till it gets over.

Soon after rejecting Arvind Kejriwal’s offer to have a pre-poll public debate, BJP CM candidate and ex-IPS officer Kiran Bedi said that instead she wanted to interrogate Kejriwal for whatever he had done in the last one year.

Speaking at a press conference, Bedi also confessed that her habit of interrogating was a side effect of her 40 year long service as an IPS officer.

Interrogation room offered by Delhi Police.

“I am not habituated of debating with my opponents. But now that I have joined politics, I guess slowly I will get rid of this old habit,” said Kiran Bedi.

However, she is hopeful that down the line she will become a normal politician. “The transition is definitely not easy, but when I look at Kejriwal, I get the feeling that it’s not impossible,” Bedi continued.

Adding further, Bedi said, in around a month she would be able to completely get out of cop mode and hopefully would be ready for debate, and precisely that was the reason why she told Kejriwal that she would debate on the floor of assembly.

In a month, Bedi is expecting to master all the tricks a politician is required to learn before appearing in a public political debate.

“She is yet to learn a lot from party spokespersons who know this art of holding their ground no matter how adverse the situation is, during a debate. Kejriwal has very well mastered this art, but Kiran madam, who is just four days old in the politics, has still a lot to learn,” said Bedi’s close aide explaining why Kejriwal was feeling more confident.

“As of now, Kiran madam is more confident about her police officer skills than her political skill sets and she is quite sure that at a public interrogation, she will make Kejriwal reveal why he actually resigned from the Delhi CM post,” Bedi’s aide told Faking News.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police has offered an interrogation room to provide perfect ambience for the high-profile interrogation, while many news channels are ready to broadcast it live.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Interrogation-Room.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/instead-of-debating-bedi-wants-to-interrogate-kejriwal-says-will-take-time-to-get-rid-of-old-habits-7224,"Instead of debating, Bedi wants to interrogate Kejriwal, says will take time to get rid of old habits",,1421749611.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after BJP announced Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate for Delhi, donors to Aam Aadmi Party demanded return of the money that AAP wasted in getting ‘Kejriwal vs Mukhi’ posters made.

It should be recalled that right after Delhi legislative assembly was dissolved in November last year, AAP had itself nominated BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi as BJP’s CM candidate and pitted Kejriwal against him in posters that were printed and pasted on Autos across Delhi.

Enraged with yesterday’s development, AAP donors took to social networking sites asking Kejriwal & Co to return their money.

Just a show piece now.

“I have been told that AAP spent more than 70% of overall donations received in getting those posters made. A true baniya would never do that,” one such donor told Faking News.

“We don’t donate money to AAP so that they end up spending it on such unproductive things. Earlier a substantial amount of our money was wasted in forfeiting deposit by AAP in Lok Sabha elections and now this. I think its high time we demand the money back and know where it is being spent,” said a rare logical AAP supporter.

While some hardcore AAP supporters lambasted donors demanding their money back and labelled them Bedi agents.

“Had they been true AAPians, instead of questioning AAP, they would have got down to streets and modified those posters by sketching Kiran Bedi’s face instead of Jagdish Mukhi,” tweeted @AAPbeforeBAAP.

However already falling short of donations this time around, Kejriwal has expressed his inability to return the money and has appealed to his donors to take bribes from BJP and Congress, to make up for their loss.

Meanwhile Mukhi has requested AAP to not take off those posters from Autos and other places.

“I am grateful to AAP for giving me the status that even my party did not bother to give me after all these years. I think this is the closest I can ever come to being a CM. I don’t want to let go off this feeling,” Mukhi said as tears rolled down his eyes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/0.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-donors-demand-return-of-money-wasted-by-aap-on-making-kejriwal-vs-jagdish-mukhi-posters-7222,AAP donors demand return of money wasted by AAP on making 'Kejriwal vs Jagdish Mukhi' posters,,1421742937.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Faced with a string of party hopping witnessed among politicians in the run up to the Delhi polls, BJP has hired an HR consultancy firm to take care of their political recruitment.

The party, which is a current favorite of politicians cutting across spectrum of corruption, through its spokesperson confirmed the development, “We generally do not have an issue with a leader changing parties too frequently. Our worry is when media tracks down their past comments, videos and tweets, it becomes difficult to justify. Though we are experts at appearing as shameless in the public life, Saheb insists good PR is essential & critical for achhe din.”

“It’s perfectly logical”

With the election scene heating up in Delhi, there is a mad last minute rush among parties and leaders alike to grab market (sic vote) share.

An insider view well known in the political circles is that politics is unlike a government job where one can retire after not working at all for 30-40yrs.

Local Delhi residents are neither concerned nor amused by this development.

Shree Ram Gupta a resident of Rohini said, “aisa hee hai jaise pehle unhone Red Line buses ka naam badal kar Blue Line kar diya tha. Red line bhi kukhyat thee, aur Blue Line bhi. Kuch nahi badla, sirf naam. Ye Neta log bhi waise hee hote hain” (It’s like when they changed the name of Red Line buses to Blue Line buses in Delhi – notorious were the red ones, and so were the blue ones – nothing changed just the name. These politicians are also the same).

On being asked, whether he would vote for the same guy in a different party, Gupta Ji had a little piece of philosophy for us, “Beta, rajniti mein bhi daag achhe hote hain.” (Son, even in politics, dirt is good), obviously referring to the catch line of a popular detergent powder.

Shazia Ilmi, a new recruit by the party agrees, “This is such a huge media conspiracy. The moment I intended to hop parties, these people just dug up my past tweets condemning the leadership. Well, even we politicians are professionals and have an equal right to join a party that has better fortunes. It’s just like say when brand manager of Coke joins Pepsi, he will prostrate himself in front of Pepsi can even when he had earlier been overtly critical of it. There’s nothing personal to it.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ilmi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-hires-hr-consultancy-firm-to-train-party-hoppers-in-the-art-of-facing-the-media-2-7206,BJP hires HR consultancy firm to train party hoppers in the art of facing the media,,1421565362.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Congress’ Delhi election campaign head Ajay Maken today claimed that it was for the same reason that he wasn’t really worried about Narendra Modi ignoring Congress and targeting only AAP during his Ramlila Maidan rally.

Maken showing the number of seats he alone will win in Delhi.

“The fight is not at all about who will win. That is almost given that Congress is winning. The fight is for runners up position. And for that I agree both BJP and AAP are strong contenders and there is a close fight,” a confident Ajay Maken told Faking News.

He claimed that both AAP and BJP have already conceded defeat by not even talking about congress.

“They may not show it, but they too like voters agree that Congress ruled Delhi well for 15 years and that it’s tried and trusted, and are hence only attacking each other,” said Maken.

Maken further pointed to virtually no campaigning by Congress as another sign of how confident party was of emerging victorious in Delhi.

“That’s why Rahul Ji and Sonia Ji are not even doing any rallies in Delhi. It’s as pointless as India cricket team practicing before a match against Kenya,” Maken explained.

“Therefore instead of wasting time, they are already planning about the development work that we will do once we are back to power in Delhi,” Maken further revealed.

When asked that if Congress was so confident of its win in Delhi, why did ex CM Sheila Dixit say that Congress may again support AAP, Maken shot back, “You got it wrong. Sheila Ji was only talking about giving emotional support to AAP once they are declared losers posts elections. You see in last few months, no other party has faced so many defeats as much as we have. It’s our moral duty to help other using that experience.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Maken_Bats_For_7508.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-and-aap-targetting-each-other-only-for-second-place-in-delhi-elections-congress-7180,BJP and AAP targetting each other only for second place in Delhi elections: Congress,,1421306277.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

BJP leaders like Sakshi Maharaj & Shyamal Goswami who are continuously asking Hindus to have more and more kids have assured people to not worry about space crunch in already overpopulated India, as they are working on “Interstellar” type mission to find a planet to accommodate extra Hindus.

BJP leader from West Bengal Shyamal Goswami was addressing a joint press conference with Sakshi Maharaj explaining why they think asking Hindu women to have five children is not that bad idea.

“Baaki ke liye main hoon na“

“Don’t think that we are short-sighted, and saying whatever we want to say. Me, Sakshi Maharaj Ji and many others who believe in what we are saying are working on a space project to find habitable planets where we will be shifting extra Hindus, once we will run out of space in India,” said Shyamal Goswami adding that everything is preplanned.

As per Mr. Goswami, VHP is helping them with the secret knowledge of aerodynamics that they have, and in the next couple of years they are expecting their spacecraft capable of traveling across galaxies to get ready.

“One of our team is even working on creation of a wormhole, which will help our spacecraft to move to different space time zone,” Shyamal Goswami further added comparing their effort to build a wormhole with what of Ram Setu, “No hindrance will be able to stop us from creating universe’s first Hindu-Grah.”

Talking more about the issue, Sakshi Maharaj said, all they wanted was that people concentrate on what they have been asked to do.

“In short, we don’t want Hindus to waste their time thinking about minor details like where their children would be living and what would they eat. We just want them to focus on producing more and more babies, for rest, hum hain na,” commented Sakshi Maharaj requesting Hindus to not panic, “If all goes well, we will have enough space to accommodate 100 billion Hindus.”

Eyeing victory in upcoming assembly elections in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party today announced that they would outsource the dharnas and drama, that they have become synonymous with, to concentrate on governance, if voted to power again.

It should be noted that Narendra Modi in his first rally in Delhi at Ramlila Madian had asked voters to let AAP do dharna which they are good at, while vote for BJP if they wanted development.

Although Kejriwal responded to this by claiming that they are pro at both staging dharnas and good governance, it was concluded in a meeting held by senior AAP leaders later, that they may compromise on one of these, if they took up both.

It was then decided by AAP that they would outsource the dharna, protests and drama, which would continue to be an integral part of their 49 days 5 year rule, to some third party.

Kejriwal wondering if governance would be as easy as dharnas.

“Frankly speaking, we have become addicted to it. It would be difficult to not resort to drama and do dharnas at the drop of a hat, but I want to assure people of Delhi that if voted again, we would only concentrate on good governance at least for the 5 year term that we get,” said Yogendra Yadav, “After we have made Delhi a world class city, maybe we will go back to dharna.”

“On second thoughts, I would be glad if after few hard days of serious work, a dharna once in a while by us, on a government holiday, is taken in good spirit by Delhi citizens,” he hoped.

Yogendra however disclosed that suggestion to outsource governance and concentrate on their core competency Dharna, was also floated in the meeting, but it was decided that it would be no challenge to do what they are already good at.

When asked if they have short listed any entity, whom they would outsource, AAP revealed that they were mighty impressed with fringe Hindu groups of late and may just finalize them.

“As far as drama is concerned, they should be able to handle it quite well, with the aid of print and electronic media, but we have doubts if they have it in them to be good dharnamen and anarchists as well,” wondered Somnath Bharti ruing the lack of good alternatives AAP has, when it comes to theatrics.

“But even if they manage to be half as good a night raiders as I was, we shall be happy,” he added.

Elaborating further on how the whole set up would work, Kejriwal said both governance and dharnas would happen simultaneously in the national capital.

“If these fringe Hindu groups run out of material to create ‘hungama’ on, we at AAP would then step in, have a brain storming session with them, before finalizing on issues that can be taken up for the day,” Kejriwal told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kejriwal-dharna.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-outsource-dharna-protests-and-drama-to-concentrate-on-governance-if-voted-to-power-in-delhi-again-7150,"AAP to outsource dharna, protests and drama to concentrate on governance if voted to power in Delhi again",,1421137748.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With just one month to go for elections in Delhi, Delhi BJP’s election strategy has come under sever scrutiny from engineering students across the country; who have accused the party’s Delhi unit of blatantly copying their last minute preparation strategy.

“Going by the way they are relaxing at the moment, with just one month way from fresh elections, its quite apparent they are copying our strategy, that too without giving us any credit,” a 22 year old 2nd year engineering student told Faking News, “At least they should have acknowledged us.”

Munching samosas and doing time pass, when they should be aggressively campaigning.

“They seem to have only now woken up to the fact that there will be elections soon and it’s only now that we are seeing some activity from their end,” he further pointed.

“But they are still only making plans and more plans; like we do every night and I don’t see any seriousness and urgency of those plans getting executed anytime soon,” he concluded.

It’s not just Delhi BJP’s deliberate dilly dallying campaigning till eleventh hour that has caught engineering students’ attention, but they point to other similarities as well to strengthen their claims.

“The very fact that they have not even announced list of candidates for any constituency is very similar to us not purchasing even text books till few days before exams,” pointed a senior engineering student, who is planning to sue Delhi BJP for plagiarizing.

“Also the fact that they are getting overconfident due to good performance in other state elections is similar to us remaining perpetually overconfident because of our good results in 10th, 12th and entrance exams,” he added.

Sakshi Maharaj, BJP MP from Unnao who recently said that every Hindu woman must produce four children, is now planning to take the matter in his own hands by setting up a test tube baby production factory to produce Hindu babies on mass level.

Sakshi Maharaj was shocked to see the backlash which he was facing for his comment, even from the Hindu section of the society.

Expected glimpse of a baby godown

“If people don’t want to participate, it’s fine. I have found a way to achieve what I want,” said the parliamentarian revealing his grand plan to set up a baby production factory in the outskirts of Delhi, “I can’t wait for others, as it’s getting too late. Population of Hindus is shrinking day by day and all these people are caring about is giving proper education, food and health facility to their children. They need to be more rough and tough.”

Sakshi Maharaj is aiming to flood market with Hindu babies in the next three years.

“I am pro-industrialization. All I am doing is trying to boost Hindu population growth using available technologies,” Sakshi Maharaj continued.

“Make in India,” he said, as he announced making Hindu babies in the factory.

Anand Tiwari, a close aide of Sakshi Maharaj revealed that they were expecting first production batch to be delivered by May 2016.

“If all goes well, by May 2016 our factory will produce around 50000 Hindu babies,” said Mr. Tiwari adding that as of now they are concentrating on hiring women who are ready to carry fertilized eggs inside them, and people who are ready to donate their sperms and eggs for fertilization, “And we are making sure that all of them are Hindus.”

Due to mass production level, a special nomenclature will be followed to name the babies. “For example, for babies born in year 2016, it will be like ‘Hindu Model Year 2016 X’, where X will be a number,” Anand Tiwari told Faking News.

On being asked what they would be doing with babies, Sakshi Maharaj said, “We will be having big godowns where we will keep them for first 10 years, after which we will set them free to live life on their own, as a proud Hindu.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Babies-300x163.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sakshi-maharaj-to-set-up-test-tube-baby-production-factory-to-produce-hindu-babies-on-mass-level-7115,"Sakshi Maharaj to set up ""Test tube baby production factory"" to produce Hindu babies on mass level",,1420630631.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“Why should boys have all the fun? “ he is reported to have said while claiming that merely impregnating wives was not enough hard work for men and they should do more to save Hinduism.

“It has come to my notice, that majority of Hindu men only pray on Tuesdays or when confronted with a difficult situation. This needs to be changed if Hinduism is to be saved in India,” the BJP MP from Unnao, said at a religious gathering in Meerut, “We must counter the concept of praying 5 times a day and Friday prayers with our own 15 prayers in a day and Tuesday havans.”

Sakshi showing Hindus how to pray with folded hands.

Calling this concept ‘Mandir Wapsi’, Sakshi Maharaj and his supporters would storm every Hindu household unannounced, make Hindu men in the house wear saffron outfits, hand them Gita and other religious text books, and forcefully take them to the nearest mandirs to make them perform pooja at least 15 times.

“They have an option of either performing these poojas in one go or they could even keep gaps in between,” Sakshi told Faking News.

“But it would be better if they help their wives their complete target of producing 4 kids during this gap,” he quickly added.

He further urged them to perform at least 2-3 of those prayers outside a Mosque or Church.

Maharaj further has plans for those Hindus who still manage to evade these poojas, by creating situations where they are forced to pray.

“We would give fake calls on their mobiles and scare them by saying stuff like his family members have met with an accident. I am sure on hearing this they would immediately start praying and thus complete their praying quota,” quipped Sakshi.

When asked, when would these Hindu people work, he shot back that it wasn’t his concern at the moment.

With quite a few foreign tours since taking over, Narendra Modi has been conferred the title of being India’s first onsite PM by his fans, who claim that this makes Modi “the first PM” in another category after “born after Independence”.

Fans claim that the number of foreign trips Modi has made so far is now second only to ex-President Pratibha Patil and way more than number of trips an average IT professional makes in his entire career, thus Modi deserves this title.

Modi arriving at yet another foreign location in style.

“The amount of onsite trips Modi has made in such a short span of time, he has become envy of every software engineer who doesn’t get onsite opportunities even after 2-3 years in the job,” claimed a Modi fan, who is also a software engineer and wonders if Modi has been trolling his fans after taking over.

“First he invited Nawaz Sharif and then met media persons we don’t like. And now he’s making us jealous!” he added.

If sources are to be believed, many engineers are thinking of resigning from their jobs and joining PMO in some capacity or other. They feel that way they will at least have some chance of making an onsite trip in their life.

Fans further argue that just like an Onsite Engineer works for his company by remaining abroad, Modi ji is working for betterment of India and its people from abroad.

“We have had PMs who have not done anything despite being in India and now we have a PM who is doing his job earnestly even after being out of India,” a fan pointed to number of initiatives Modi has announced being abroad.

“And he is a true blue onsite guy, which is proven by the fact that he is not just flaunting his visit to US, Japan etc but is also not averse to visiting countries like Myanmar,” the fan added, liking the Prime Minister’s photos on Instagram.

Fans on social media, especially on Twitter, also claim that Nehru could be India’s first PM but he was certainly not India’s first onsite PM.

Two men, one a supporter of BJP and another NCP supporter, were found hugging each other near Marine Drive this afternoon, jobless sources who gather there to watch couples confirm to Faking News.

Sources further confirm that barely a minute had passed with both of them in each other’s arms that some Shiv Sainiks started beating them.

It is not yet clear whether the Sainiks were enraged at public display of same sex affection or over the political affiliations of the men, but both BJP and NCP have condemned this “moral policing” by Shiv Sena.

The men were unidentified but according to sources, they were wearing masks.

“This is highly objectionable. We stand for individual liberty,” a BJP leader condemned the attack, though he declined to comment on whether the party was in favor of gay rights.

NCP too claimed that Shiv Sena was trying to destabilize the routine activities at Marine Drive. They later rejected demands by some quarters asking for a fair investigation to ascertain if the hugging men possessed and consumed some banned drug that caused them to fall in each other’s arms.

“The law will take its own course, but those men shouldn’t be victimized,” an NCP leader said referring to the couple who were targeted by Shiv Sena, “But trust us, there is no need for any investigations.”

To further protest against such acts of Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP have announced a “Kiss of Love” campaign which will involve the two parties working closely on various issues.

However, Shiv Sena has called it a drama and accused BJP of kissing in an obscene manner publicly when they could have done the same inside a private room with little help from Shiv Sainiks.

“Why did the BJP guy choose the NCP guy who was earlier seen on Marine Drive pissing publicly in the ocean?” a Shiv Sena leader protested, “We will not tolerate such behavior and bash these guys again.”

The termites claim they were originally hired by the UPA leader to clean up all 2G related files, but ended up eating his expense related vouchers after 5 months of agonizing wait in his CA’s office.

Singhvi asking termites to get out.

“We were kept hungry for so long that we could not wait any longer and ate up those vouchers,” the termites explained how they were forced to indulge in this act of tax evasion for the Congress leader.

“When everybody around us was eating something or the other, how could we control ourselves?” they quickly added.

“Also many of us were so bored of waiting for orders from the UPA. Like always, the decision making process of the government was very slow forcing us to eat other papers,” termites further argued.

Termites claim that the UPA government had planned to destroy files related to 2G scam, and for that they chose termite attack as ‘accidental fire’ was too mainstream.

However, the plan was never executed by the UPA government for some reason, which made the insects hungry for Singhvi’s papers.

Termites, in retrospect, now feel that it could be a ploy by Singhvi to make them eat two different sets of documents while paying them (the termites) for only one set of documents.

However, experts believe that this agonizing wait for termites could be due to change in tactics by the Congress party, where they decided to bury DMK and now P Chidambaram, instead of burying the files.

“But we should look into the possibility of these termites being hired to eat coal files. We might finally know the secret behind some files that had gone missing,” an expert on missing files told Faking News.

Fresh from justifying his stand about expelling Gujaratis from Mumbai to media houses and on Twitter, Rane was tired and thought of rejuvenating himself while watching TV, when the unfortunate incident occurred.

Rane invited Media after the incident.

“Saheb was also excited to see if Arnab and Co had finally taken notice of him and had his fingers crossed,” Rane’s servant revealed.

However to Rane’s horror, the battery of the remote control discharged suddenly while he was flipping through channels and got stuck on DD Gujarati. Unable to do much about it, he got restless and first broke the remote.

Coupled with his failure to find himself being discussed on news channels and also being unsuccessful in his attempt trend on Twitter, he smashed his TV in a fit of rage.

“It seemed that DD Gujarati channel was trying to take control of a TV in a Marathi household and hence had to be taught a lesson,” he justified his decision to break his TV.

Later on insistence of his wife and children, Rane bought a new TV set from a shop after being convinced of shopkeeper’s Marathi identity, and immediately unsubscribed to all Gujarati channels his DTH service provider had to offer.

“Took part in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and started from my TV. Cleaned up all Marathi hating Gujarati channels from it once and for all,” the son of senior Congress leader, Narayan Rane, later tweeted.

He further argued that in TVs, Marathi channels don’t get slots (channel nos) of their choice because they are Marathi’s and actors are non-vegetarians.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/if-politicians-were-cricketers-what-would-their-respective-autobiographies-say-6668,"Mumbai: On the occasion of release of Sachin’s book, Faking News asked various politicians for their viewpoint on ‘Playing it my way’. Here are the responses:

Narendra Modi: After I scored a triple century on debut for the national team, the public now expects at least a double century in every match from me. Hereon, I have to keep playing my natural aggressive game, always on the front foot and keep scoring consistently so that asking rate is maintained.

Not only bat well, my teammates now expect me to be present wherever the ball is hit to stop runs and take catches.

“It was nightwatchman’s fault”

L K Advani: Still, hoping against hope that they make me the captain in the next outing.

Suresh Kalmadi: Fixing was done by others and I have been framed for spot fixing. Some day I too will write a book and name the Greg Chappell in my game.

Sonia Gandhi: Chasing 272 was always going to be tall order on an unfriendly pitch but never expected that we will be bundled out for 44. There was, however, no fault on the captain’s part. Now, many players might desert us but we are all for playing the same team.

Though I have been the non playing captain all through, Rahul will be on field captain in the next championship tournament for sure.

Manmohan Singh: Never on the front foot, I always played from the safety of my crease. Risking my own wicket, I ran so many cheeky singles to give strike to my other team mates so that they could score quickly and improve their individual record.

Rather than go for a century, our players were happy scoring 20-30 runs in every match just to maintain their places in the team and come back to the pavilion in a hurry to strike lucrative endorsement deals.

Think I enjoyed playing on foreign pitches more than on domestic grounds. Oh, as usual, I must not forget to thank the non playing captain for her guidance and support.

Arvind Kejriwal: The opposition indulged in corruption and bribed the grounds-man who shifted the boundary to make it difficult for my players to hit a four or a six. The umpires were also biased. They no-balled us repeatedly and many LBW decisions went against us.

In the second innings of the last match, spectators booed us as we had played many rash shots.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ncp-offers-outside-support-to-anti-corruption-bureau-6633,"Mumbai. In the wake of its attempt of shoving outside support down BJP’s throat in Maharashtra not amounting to much, the NCP, in a move that has no precedents or logic, has offered unconditional outside support to the state Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB).

The party claims that the ACB is facing several problems like shortage of staff and missing files and hence could do with a little help from their party that has had a long association with ACB. The party claims that it will also be a distraction for some of their senior party members who are resorting to cheap thrills like peeing in dams to pass their time.

Sharad Pawar and Co and deliberating on whom to offer outside support next.

A senior party leader explained, “People are ridiculing us and calling us things like OSP (Outside Support Party) but this is a testing time for us and we want to use it constructively. While on one hand the ACB is suffering from severe manpower crisis, majority of our leaders are jobless and are going around offering outside support to everything from local cricket clubs to dilapidated houses. This will be a win-win for both of us.”

Another leader known to suffer from a severe case of foot in the mouth syndrome said, “We hear the condition of ACB is so bad, that they have also started employing woman officers.” The leader then paused, looked mortified and took leave of the reporter after whispering, “I think I have crossed some line here again. I better go.”

Calling their relation with ACB ‘ghar ki baat‘, another senior party leader said, “Our relations with the ACB go back a long way. So many times, when our leaders are not found at their residence we directly go to the local ACB office to see if they are there. ACB keeps inviting our party men and now the officers and leaders are on first name basis and some are even facebook friends.”

“While a lot of the credit for this strong bond goes to the party leadership, the next generation has taken the relation to a different level. They say that not a day goes by without talks of dada at the ACB. In fact, we hear his photograph also adorns several dartboards put up at the agency for refreshing the employees and releasing frustration during breaks,” the leader confessed.

When questioned how they would help the ACB in the absence of any legal training, the leader said, “Arey we do not need any training. Our lives have gone playing with chargesheets and picking holes in it.” He added, “In fact, I have so many bounded chargesheets at home, that now I have developed a taste for them and have a few favorites as well. You must read DySP Ravish Kumar’s chargesheets for the use of metaphors. He once called our party ‘the Bermuda triangle of development scheme funds’.”

A source who attended the meeting where the decision was taken however confessed to this reporter, “See all our outside supports to governments is to ensure ACB is kept away. Rather than humiliating ourselves with political parties, we’d rather approach the ACB directly and cut a deal.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ncp-support.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ncp-offers-outside-support-to-anti-corruption-bureau-6633,NCP offers outside support to Anti Corruption Bureau,,1414826258.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Supreme Court today expressed satisfaction over Lt Govermor Najeeb Jung ‘s move to consult all political parties in Delhi for govt formation, AAP has decided to move Supreme Court against Supreme Court’s decision.

AAP is particularly annoyed with SC deferring the hearing once again and wants SC to teach a lesson to itself.

Kejriwal hasn’t ruled out another Dharna over this issue.

“After getting copy of Supreme Court’s recent statement, we will approach Supreme Court to review those statements,” AAP leader and senior lawyer, Prashant Bushan confirmed to Faking News.

Faking News spoke to party chief Arvind Kejriwal and asked him if it was another u-turn by him after he yesterday praised SC in his tweets.

“Till yesterday I was thinking that Supreme Court is an independent entity when they pulled up BJP govt on black money issue, but today I am saddened to say even it is working in collusion with BJP,” Kejriwal declared.

“Sab mile hue hain ji,” he quickly added amidst huge cheers from AAP supporters.

When asked how logical was moving SC against SC, Ashutosh, another senior leader of AAP said it was very much within constitutional AAP framework.

“Since unfortunately SC is still the highest court in the country, we will have to move it against it, till AAP comes to power and swaraj is established and aam aadmis become the supreme judges,” Ashutosh justified his party’s decision.

When asked if Supreme Court was acting as BJP agent or Ambani Agent, Kejriwal remained non-committal.

However, Kejriwal maintained that since SC took a hard stance against black money issue; they could not be Ambani agents but assured he would soon be able to come to conclusion as to whose agents they were exactly.

If sources from Shiv Sena are to be believed, number of ministries demanded by senior leaders of the party from BJP, in lieu of their support, have now exceeded the number of MLAs they have won in just concluded assembly elections.

In order to make up for the blunder, Shiv Sena is now looking for allies that can help party accommodate such ministries once BJP agrees to their demands.

“In our ego and over excitement we have by now demanded so many ministries, that god forbid if BJP bows down to our demands, we won’t have sufficient number of MLAs to fill up those ministries and it will be a huge embarrassment to the party and Marathi pride and people in particular,” one Shiv Sena MLA confirmed the development to Faking News on conditions of anonymity.

Party chief and still CM hopeful Uddhav Thackeray too conceded the error in judgment made by him and other senior leaders.

“In hindsight, I feel we may have gone overboard and forgotten our own strength before making such huge demands. But I am glad we stopped before exceeding the number of ministries an Indian state has,” said a tensed and at the same time relieved Uddhav.

He however lashed out at our reporter when he told him that instead of looking for more MLAs from allies, he could instead take back the demands and end the matter there.

“Yeda ho gela aahe kya? We have an ego to keep. We can’t go back on our words and demands now, so naturally we will have to look for other means and ways to make sure those ministries once allocated to us can be adjusted,” reasoned Uddhav.

Arguing that they want to get over such post poll speculations in advance, NCP leader Praful Patel promised all single largest parties in future elections of his party’s backing.

Sharad Pawar telling Praful Patel that decision is too much of opportunism even by his standards.

“We want to save ours, media’s, political analysts’ and twitterattis time once and for all, so that we all can focus on other important things like post poll benefits,” announced Praful Patel in a press conference.

“Benefits for citizens,” he quickly clarified.

“All winning parties in future be it Shiv Sena, BJP, Congress, MN…errr… never mind, can consider NCP as its natural ally,” Patel continued, “And if we end up as single largest party, we invite everyone in advance.”

“We aren’t like other party leaders who even after having fared poorly continue to have swagger of a party that has won a clear majority,” said Patel, probably hinting at Uddhav Thackeray.

Patel further claimed that NCP was the only party that respected and valued voters’ mandate more than others, in fact, more than the voters.

He also lashed out at those who suggested that NCP was offering support under the fear of corruption cases against party leaders.

Later, the press conference was addressed by Ajit Pawar, who was earlier busy urinating in office toilet.

“Though howsoever secular it may sound, we are not Begani shaadi mein Abdullah deewana, as being suggested by many,” Ajit Pawar explained his party’s position, “But we are more like beech ka bichchoo in a gully cricket match, we play a part in both winning and losing.”

Soon after it became clear that Congress has lost its ground in the recently held assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana where they were ruling, party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has requested UNESCO to declare Congress a World Heritage Party.

Considering the looming threat of Congress being completely wiped out from Indian political scene, experts are seeing Rahul’s initiative as a well thought and mature move to save his party.

Soon it will be a tourist spot.

However, it’s not going down well with BJP.

“Indian National Congress is the oldest political party in India. And taking into account whatever happened with it in the last 6 months, my demand for its preservation is pretty rational. If not taken proper care of, very soon India will lose one of its pre-independence era monument,” said Rahul Gandhi pitching his proposal.

“Parties like BJP talk about culture and all, but don’t give a damn about Congress, which is also a cultural heritage of India,” a visibly angry Rahul made scathing remarks against the ruling party, “It seems Narendra Modi has has stopped caring about old things. First Advani and now Congress. That’s why we are making an appeal to an international agency to step in.”

Rahul further claimed that Congress was the only party which believed in preserving the heritage and it tried to preserve the India that the British left in 1947.

“Our party tried its best to keep India the way it was. Be it poverty or other such issues, we preserved it, even though it wasn’t that easy as it seems to be. But what we got in return? Nothing! People are adamant to destroy us. Now, UNESCO and UN intervention is the last ray of hope,” Rahul concluded his emotional outburst on a sentimental note.

Congress is expecting UNESCO to talk to the government of India regarding formation of new rules and laws to preserve the grand old party.

A source close to the Congress high command revealed that party leaders were lobbying hard to freeze the current status of Congress MPs and MLAs forever.

“It means no election will take place on those seats in future. Current Congress MPs and MLAs will never be removed, and the position will be passed on from generation to generation within the family,” the source explained the plan to Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/INC_Office.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-requests-unesco-to-declare-congress-a-world-heritage-party-and-preserve-it-6538,Rahul Gandhi requests UNESCO to declare Congress a World Heritage Party and preserve it,,1413700958.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

If sources are to be believed, many engineers are thinking of resigning from their jobs and joining PMO in some capacity or other. They feel that way they will at least have some chance of making an onsite trip in their life.

Fans further argue that just like an Onsite Engineer works for his company by remaining abroad, Modi ji is working for betterment of India and its people from abroad.

“We have had PMs who have not done anything despite being in India and now we have a PM who is doing his job earnestly even after being out of India,” a fan pointed to number of initiatives Modi has announced being abroad.

“And he is a true blue onsite guy, which is proven by the fact that he is not just flaunting his visit to US, Japan etc but is also not averse to visiting countries like Myanmar,” the fan added, liking the Prime Minister’s photos on Instagram.

Two men, one a supporter of BJP and another NCP supporter, were found hugging each other near Marine Drive this afternoon, jobless sources who gather there to watch couples confirm to Faking News.

Sources further confirm that barely a minute had passed with both of them in each other’s arms that some Shiv Sainiks started beating them.

It is not yet clear whether the Sainiks were enraged at public display of same sex affection or over the political affiliations of the men, but both BJP and NCP have condemned this “moral policing” by Shiv Sena.

The men were unidentified but according to sources, they were wearing masks.

“This is highly objectionable. We stand for individual liberty,” a BJP leader condemned the attack, though he declined to comment on whether the party was in favor of gay rights.

NCP too claimed that Shiv Sena was trying to destabilize the routine activities at Marine Drive. They later rejected demands by some quarters asking for a fair investigation to ascertain if the hugging men possessed and consumed some banned drug that caused them to fall in each other’s arms.

“The law will take its own course, but those men shouldn’t be victimized,” an NCP leader said referring to the couple who were targeted by Shiv Sena, “But trust us, there is no need for any investigations.”

To further protest against such acts of Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP have announced a “Kiss of Love” campaign which will involve the two parties working closely on various issues.

However, Shiv Sena has called it a drama and accused BJP of kissing in an obscene manner publicly when they could have done the same inside a private room with little help from Shiv Sainiks.

“Why did the BJP guy choose the NCP guy who was earlier seen on Marine Drive pissing publicly in the ocean?” a Shiv Sena leader protested, “We will not tolerate such behavior and bash these guys again.”

The termites claim they were originally hired by the UPA leader to clean up all 2G related files, but ended up eating his expense related vouchers after 5 months of agonizing wait in his CA’s office.

Singhvi asking termites to get out.

“We were kept hungry for so long that we could not wait any longer and ate up those vouchers,” the termites explained how they were forced to indulge in this act of tax evasion for the Congress leader.

“When everybody around us was eating something or the other, how could we control ourselves?” they quickly added.

“Also many of us were so bored of waiting for orders from the UPA. Like always, the decision making process of the government was very slow forcing us to eat other papers,” termites further argued.

Termites claim that the UPA government had planned to destroy files related to 2G scam, and for that they chose termite attack as ‘accidental fire’ was too mainstream.

However, the plan was never executed by the UPA government for some reason, which made the insects hungry for Singhvi’s papers.

Termites, in retrospect, now feel that it could be a ploy by Singhvi to make them eat two different sets of documents while paying them (the termites) for only one set of documents.

However, experts believe that this agonizing wait for termites could be due to change in tactics by the Congress party, where they decided to bury DMK and now P Chidambaram, instead of burying the files.

“But we should look into the possibility of these termites being hired to eat coal files. We might finally know the secret behind some files that had gone missing,” an expert on missing files told Faking News.

Fresh from justifying his stand about expelling Gujaratis from Mumbai to media houses and on Twitter, Rane was tired and thought of rejuvenating himself while watching TV, when the unfortunate incident occurred.

Rane invited Media after the incident.

“Saheb was also excited to see if Arnab and Co had finally taken notice of him and had his fingers crossed,” Rane’s servant revealed.

However to Rane’s horror, the battery of the remote control discharged suddenly while he was flipping through channels and got stuck on DD Gujarati. Unable to do much about it, he got restless and first broke the remote.

Coupled with his failure to find himself being discussed on news channels and also being unsuccessful in his attempt trend on Twitter, he smashed his TV in a fit of rage.

“It seemed that DD Gujarati channel was trying to take control of a TV in a Marathi household and hence had to be taught a lesson,” he justified his decision to break his TV.

Later on insistence of his wife and children, Rane bought a new TV set from a shop after being convinced of shopkeeper’s Marathi identity, and immediately unsubscribed to all Gujarati channels his DTH service provider had to offer.

“Took part in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and started from my TV. Cleaned up all Marathi hating Gujarati channels from it once and for all,” the son of senior Congress leader, Narayan Rane, later tweeted.

He further argued that in TVs, Marathi channels don’t get slots (channel nos) of their choice because they are Marathi’s and actors are non-vegetarians.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/if-politicians-were-cricketers-what-would-their-respective-autobiographies-say-6668,"Mumbai: On the occasion of release of Sachin’s book, Faking News asked various politicians for their viewpoint on ‘Playing it my way’. Here are the responses:

Narendra Modi: After I scored a triple century on debut for the national team, the public now expects at least a double century in every match from me. Hereon, I have to keep playing my natural aggressive game, always on the front foot and keep scoring consistently so that asking rate is maintained.

Not only bat well, my teammates now expect me to be present wherever the ball is hit to stop runs and take catches.

“It was nightwatchman’s fault”

L K Advani: Still, hoping against hope that they make me the captain in the next outing.

Suresh Kalmadi: Fixing was done by others and I have been framed for spot fixing. Some day I too will write a book and name the Greg Chappell in my game.

Sonia Gandhi: Chasing 272 was always going to be tall order on an unfriendly pitch but never expected that we will be bundled out for 44. There was, however, no fault on the captain’s part. Now, many players might desert us but we are all for playing the same team.

Though I have been the non playing captain all through, Rahul will be on field captain in the next championship tournament for sure.

Manmohan Singh: Never on the front foot, I always played from the safety of my crease. Risking my own wicket, I ran so many cheeky singles to give strike to my other team mates so that they could score quickly and improve their individual record.

Rather than go for a century, our players were happy scoring 20-30 runs in every match just to maintain their places in the team and come back to the pavilion in a hurry to strike lucrative endorsement deals.

Think I enjoyed playing on foreign pitches more than on domestic grounds. Oh, as usual, I must not forget to thank the non playing captain for her guidance and support.

Arvind Kejriwal: The opposition indulged in corruption and bribed the grounds-man who shifted the boundary to make it difficult for my players to hit a four or a six. The umpires were also biased. They no-balled us repeatedly and many LBW decisions went against us.

In the second innings of the last match, spectators booed us as we had played many rash shots.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ncp-offers-outside-support-to-anti-corruption-bureau-6633,"Mumbai. In the wake of its attempt of shoving outside support down BJP’s throat in Maharashtra not amounting to much, the NCP, in a move that has no precedents or logic, has offered unconditional outside support to the state Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB).

The party claims that the ACB is facing several problems like shortage of staff and missing files and hence could do with a little help from their party that has had a long association with ACB. The party claims that it will also be a distraction for some of their senior party members who are resorting to cheap thrills like peeing in dams to pass their time.

Sharad Pawar and Co and deliberating on whom to offer outside support next.

A senior party leader explained, “People are ridiculing us and calling us things like OSP (Outside Support Party) but this is a testing time for us and we want to use it constructively. While on one hand the ACB is suffering from severe manpower crisis, majority of our leaders are jobless and are going around offering outside support to everything from local cricket clubs to dilapidated houses. This will be a win-win for both of us.”

Another leader known to suffer from a severe case of foot in the mouth syndrome said, “We hear the condition of ACB is so bad, that they have also started employing woman officers.” The leader then paused, looked mortified and took leave of the reporter after whispering, “I think I have crossed some line here again. I better go.”

Calling their relation with ACB ‘ghar ki baat‘, another senior party leader said, “Our relations with the ACB go back a long way. So many times, when our leaders are not found at their residence we directly go to the local ACB office to see if they are there. ACB keeps inviting our party men and now the officers and leaders are on first name basis and some are even facebook friends.”

“While a lot of the credit for this strong bond goes to the party leadership, the next generation has taken the relation to a different level. They say that not a day goes by without talks of dada at the ACB. In fact, we hear his photograph also adorns several dartboards put up at the agency for refreshing the employees and releasing frustration during breaks,” the leader confessed.

When questioned how they would help the ACB in the absence of any legal training, the leader said, “Arey we do not need any training. Our lives have gone playing with chargesheets and picking holes in it.” He added, “In fact, I have so many bounded chargesheets at home, that now I have developed a taste for them and have a few favorites as well. You must read DySP Ravish Kumar’s chargesheets for the use of metaphors. He once called our party ‘the Bermuda triangle of development scheme funds’.”

A source who attended the meeting where the decision was taken however confessed to this reporter, “See all our outside supports to governments is to ensure ACB is kept away. Rather than humiliating ourselves with political parties, we’d rather approach the ACB directly and cut a deal.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ncp-support.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ncp-offers-outside-support-to-anti-corruption-bureau-6633,NCP offers outside support to Anti Corruption Bureau,,1414826258.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Supreme Court today expressed satisfaction over Lt Govermor Najeeb Jung ‘s move to consult all political parties in Delhi for govt formation, AAP has decided to move Supreme Court against Supreme Court’s decision.

AAP is particularly annoyed with SC deferring the hearing once again and wants SC to teach a lesson to itself.

Kejriwal hasn’t ruled out another Dharna over this issue.

“After getting copy of Supreme Court’s recent statement, we will approach Supreme Court to review those statements,” AAP leader and senior lawyer, Prashant Bushan confirmed to Faking News.

Faking News spoke to party chief Arvind Kejriwal and asked him if it was another u-turn by him after he yesterday praised SC in his tweets.

“Till yesterday I was thinking that Supreme Court is an independent entity when they pulled up BJP govt on black money issue, but today I am saddened to say even it is working in collusion with BJP,” Kejriwal declared.

“Sab mile hue hain ji,” he quickly added amidst huge cheers from AAP supporters.

When asked how logical was moving SC against SC, Ashutosh, another senior leader of AAP said it was very much within constitutional AAP framework.

“Since unfortunately SC is still the highest court in the country, we will have to move it against it, till AAP comes to power and swaraj is established and aam aadmis become the supreme judges,” Ashutosh justified his party’s decision.

When asked if Supreme Court was acting as BJP agent or Ambani Agent, Kejriwal remained non-committal.

However, Kejriwal maintained that since SC took a hard stance against black money issue; they could not be Ambani agents but assured he would soon be able to come to conclusion as to whose agents they were exactly.

If sources from Shiv Sena are to be believed, number of ministries demanded by senior leaders of the party from BJP, in lieu of their support, have now exceeded the number of MLAs they have won in just concluded assembly elections.

In order to make up for the blunder, Shiv Sena is now looking for allies that can help party accommodate such ministries once BJP agrees to their demands.

“In our ego and over excitement we have by now demanded so many ministries, that god forbid if BJP bows down to our demands, we won’t have sufficient number of MLAs to fill up those ministries and it will be a huge embarrassment to the party and Marathi pride and people in particular,” one Shiv Sena MLA confirmed the development to Faking News on conditions of anonymity.

Party chief and still CM hopeful Uddhav Thackeray too conceded the error in judgment made by him and other senior leaders.

“In hindsight, I feel we may have gone overboard and forgotten our own strength before making such huge demands. But I am glad we stopped before exceeding the number of ministries an Indian state has,” said a tensed and at the same time relieved Uddhav.

He however lashed out at our reporter when he told him that instead of looking for more MLAs from allies, he could instead take back the demands and end the matter there.

“Yeda ho gela aahe kya? We have an ego to keep. We can’t go back on our words and demands now, so naturally we will have to look for other means and ways to make sure those ministries once allocated to us can be adjusted,” reasoned Uddhav.

Sharad Pawar telling Praful Patel that decision is too much of opportunism even by his standards.

“We want to save ours, media’s, political analysts’ and twitterattis time once and for all, so that we all can focus on other important things like post poll benefits,” announced Praful Patel in a press conference.

“Benefits for citizens,” he quickly clarified.

“All winning parties in future be it Shiv Sena, BJP, Congress, MN…errr… never mind, can consider NCP as its natural ally,” Patel continued, “And if we end up as single largest party, we invite everyone in advance.”

“We aren’t like other party leaders who even after having fared poorly continue to have swagger of a party that has won a clear majority,” said Patel, probably hinting at Uddhav Thackeray.

Patel further claimed that NCP was the only party that respected and valued voters’ mandate more than others, in fact, more than the voters.

He also lashed out at those who suggested that NCP was offering support under the fear of corruption cases against party leaders.

Later, the press conference was addressed by Ajit Pawar, who was earlier busy urinating in office toilet.

“Though howsoever secular it may sound, we are not Begani shaadi mein Abdullah deewana, as being suggested by many,” Ajit Pawar explained his party’s position, “But we are more like beech ka bichchoo in a gully cricket match, we play a part in both winning and losing.”

Soon after it became clear that Congress has lost its ground in the recently held assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana where they were ruling, party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has requested UNESCO to declare Congress a World Heritage Party.

Considering the looming threat of Congress being completely wiped out from Indian political scene, experts are seeing Rahul’s initiative as a well thought and mature move to save his party.

Soon it will be a tourist spot.

However, it’s not going down well with BJP.

“Indian National Congress is the oldest political party in India. And taking into account whatever happened with it in the last 6 months, my demand for its preservation is pretty rational. If not taken proper care of, very soon India will lose one of its pre-independence era monument,” said Rahul Gandhi pitching his proposal.

“Parties like BJP talk about culture and all, but don’t give a damn about Congress, which is also a cultural heritage of India,” a visibly angry Rahul made scathing remarks against the ruling party, “It seems Narendra Modi has has stopped caring about old things. First Advani and now Congress. That’s why we are making an appeal to an international agency to step in.”

Rahul further claimed that Congress was the only party which believed in preserving the heritage and it tried to preserve the India that the British left in 1947.

“Our party tried its best to keep India the way it was. Be it poverty or other such issues, we preserved it, even though it wasn’t that easy as it seems to be. But what we got in return? Nothing! People are adamant to destroy us. Now, UNESCO and UN intervention is the last ray of hope,” Rahul concluded his emotional outburst on a sentimental note.

Congress is expecting UNESCO to talk to the government of India regarding formation of new rules and laws to preserve the grand old party.

A source close to the Congress high command revealed that party leaders were lobbying hard to freeze the current status of Congress MPs and MLAs forever.

“It means no election will take place on those seats in future. Current Congress MPs and MLAs will never be removed, and the position will be passed on from generation to generation within the family,” the source explained the plan to Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/INC_Office.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-requests-unesco-to-declare-congress-a-world-heritage-party-and-preserve-it-6538,Rahul Gandhi requests UNESCO to declare Congress a World Heritage Party and preserve it,,1413700958.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In one of the first few statements released to media since his return, Congress-Yuvraj Rahul Gandhi has advised countrymen to consume copious amount of cotton candy, regardless of their age. He lauded eating cotton-candy as single most crucial steps the citizens can take to help cotton farmers and revive country’s agriculture sector. Talking to an audience at “Rahul Gandhi comeback rally for farmers”, Rahul questioned the ruling government.

Arvinder Lovely: “Kam se kam 5 candy khao roz”

“I don’t understand why Modi government is not making eating cotton candy mandatory. Cotton-candy which also known as “Budhiya ke baal” has been my favorite since childhood and I have no shame in admitting that I still love it. If government makes consumption of cotton-candy mandatory then the citizens will buy and consume it in high amounts, and will enjoy it. That money directly will go into the pockets of our poor, wretched, frustrated farmers and they will be pulled out of economic depression within a few weeks. It is a win-win economic strategy for all and will revive our country’s GDP and TRP overnight,” Rahul declared amidst huge round of applause & whistles as the man beside him quickly showed large “applause” cue-board to the audience.

When a reporter from audience expressed concerns that a lot of people in the country may actually dislike cotton candy, Rahul laughed like a kid and said, “Today morning, when I woke up at night, I felt such a craving for cotton candy. Thankfully at that time I was staying in the roof-less hut of Bholu, a poor cotton farmer and he was immediately able to fetch some cotton from his farm and make me some fresh cotton candy for me. I just loved it. I am sure we all will love it. Deep inside we all are nothing but kids.”

Ace psephologist and AAP rebel Yogendra Yadav today requested Kejriwal to let him carry out last internal survey for the party before he is shown the door.

It should be noted that Yogendra was expelled from party late night yesterday for anti-party activities (as claimed by AAP) but was still waiting for the expulsion order.

Taking advantage of the delay, Yadav called up Kejriwal putting forward his request.

“Bas ek survey aur karne dijiye mujhe”

“Having committed and dedicate 80% of my tenure in AAP to carrying out internal surveys, I hope party will at least value the time and energy I spent in it to honor my last wish,” Yadav told the Press from the mini Press Club he opened at his residence recently.

“I have further requested them to let me carry out these surveys on my home turf Haryana,” Yadav added.

When told that next elections of some importance in Haryana were still some years away, Yogendra shot back, “The format of the elections hardly matters at this point in my career. I am willing to carry out surveys even for Zila Parishad elections at Rewari which are due for later this year.”

Fans of Yogendra Yadav too stood outside AAP HQ, demanding one last internal survey commissioned to him.

“His last few surveys may have been off the mark but that doesn’t mean you give him such an unceremonious exit,” argued a man called Yograj Singh.

“Always remember form (survey forms) is temporary and class is permanent,” said another fan of Yadav.

Meanwhile Kejriwal fearing getting less seats in any internal survey in Haryana (due to Yadav’s expulsion), has decided to reject Yadav’s demand.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/raga-is-a-skilled-administrator-and-a-mellifluous-orator-but-in-a-parallel-universe-claims-philosopher-7842,"New Delhi: Renowned philosopher and sociologist Dr. Jasjeet Jagan has claimed in his recent book on Rahul baba that he is a proficient administrator and a mellifluous orator. The book is titled – “The full blood prince – Truest story ever told”.

Although according to a rumor spread in media, in this book he is apparently not talking about Rahul baba from our world but about his counterpart-clone in a parallel world in another dimension. Our reporter met Dr. Jagan for a short interview, at his farmhouse, to clarify this matter.

Reporter: Namsate Dr. Jagan

Dr. Jagan: Howdy.

Reporter: Sir you have recently written a book “The full blood prince – Truest story ever” on Rahul baba and made some significant claims about his talents. There were news reports in some parts of media that in this book you were actually not talking about Rahul baba from our world but about his counterpart in a parallel universe. Which seems right since our Rahul baba is talented but not to the extreme you have taken him to. But upon reading this book I see that you have not mentioned anywhere that you are actually talking about a parallel universe. It all looks like you are talking about our universe and our Rahul baba. Can you please clarify this?

Dr. Jagan: Well yes, this book is now available as an e-book also, please buy some copies on e-comm websites also.

“Yeh hain hi nahi is duniya ke”

Reporter: Yes I will do that, but please answer my question. Where does it mention in the book that you are talking about a parallel universe and not about our universe?

DJ: There’s the disclaimer on the 5th page in the book, just after the preface.

Reporter: Can you please show me? [Reporter showed a copy of the book to Dr. Jagan] DJ: Here it is, perhaps the font is very small since it’s just a disclaimer.

Reporter: Still, can’t see it. This page is blank.

DJ: Oh yeah, … seems like disclaimer has been smudged in this copy of the book.

Reporter: This does not seem like a smudge, it’s a smooth surface.

DJ: Oh then it is possible that the disclaimer might not have been printed in some copies of the book. Some publishers I tell you, they are very reckless.

Reporter: Sir, I have checked 4 copies of your books from 4 different stores, I have even bought the e-book version of your book from internet, can’t see the disclaimer in any of these copies.

DJ: Oh Rahul … I mean Oh God, you are just after my life on this disclaimer, … can we please move onto the next question?

Reporter: Ok let’s talk about the concept of parallel universes. How were you able to look into a parallel universe and describe its details? Even modern science only has just theories about parallel universes.

DJ: Well I was not able to look into it, I just dreamed about it. I truly believe Rahul baba is a golden prince with extreme talents. He is a proficient administrator and a mellifluous orator. He is the savior this country has needed since dark ages. And he is going to return soon.

Reporter: Wait a second. You are talking about his counterpart in a parallel universe … right?

DJ: Yes, yes that’s what I mean.

Reporter: It is also being said that this parallel universe is being called Narnia. Is that right?

DJ: What rubbish. There is no parallel universe.

Reporter: What? There is none? You said there is one.

DJ: There is, but it’s not called Narnia

Reporter: What is it called then?

DJ: Nothing

Reporter: It’s called “nothing”?

DJ: No no, it’s just … I have not given it any name as yet. Why are you so much after this parallel universe. Just accept my book as it is, as truth.

Reporter: But the fact, that what you are saying is applicable to our universe or to another, does make a huge difference. Doesn’t it?

DJ: You know what. I do not intend to answer any more questions from you. Please leave.

Reporter: But Dr. Jagan …

DJ: Enough! Security!!

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-takes-retirement-from-vacationing-after-running-out-of-places-to-vacation-7838,"New Delhi. In a move that is sure to send panic waves in the tourism industry, Rahul Gandhi’s office released an official statement today stating that the youth icon will take voluntary retirement from vacationing as he has run out of places to vacation.

Ganjay Ojha, spokesperson for Congress told this reporter that the original plan of Congress Vice President was to come back from vacation and spend a good amount of time here in Delhi before thinking of another vacation.

A tired Rahul Gandhi thinking where to go for his next vacation

However, Mr. Gandhi was dead tired and exhausted after working for full 26 minutes at Congress HQ empowering youth and women and RTI. That’s when he decided to go on his next vacation, only to realize that he has run out of places to vacation.

“We are devastated! All Congressis have been living our dream of traveling the world through Rahulji’s eyes,” Raju Chutkula, a professional Gandhi family loyalist said, “But we have not lost all hopes. When Congress comes to power after mid-term elections next year, we will launch ‘Rahul Gandhi Space Tourism Yojna’ and spend lakhs of crores of tax payer’s money on sending Rahulji to travel outside of earth to empower youth and women and RTI.”

Meanwhile, Jatra.com has shown keen interest in acquiring Rahul Gandhi’s private travel team for $80Million. As per an industry source, Rahul Gandhi’s private travel team is slightly bigger than Jatra.com’s entire team in 3 global offices and would be a great fit bringing in expertise in arranging travel to every corner of the globe and that too maintaining unprecedented privacy.

Travel Industry insiders however have criticized the move by Rahul Gandhi saying it will cripple economies of several small nations that were banking on the young Congress leader to vacation there.

Hasmukh Patel of Travel association of India was quite sad. “Several countries will go bankrupt. Tourism industry will see its greatest fall since President Pratibha Patil’s retirement. We are finished,” he said.

Among all the gloom though, one group was ecstatic. Arjinder Bagga, a vocal supporter of BJP was seen distributing sweets on the streets of Delhi at the news of Rahul retiring from vacationing.

“I am very happy at RaGa staying in India often. I am a fan of his socio-scientific theories like ‘Jupiter velocity for dalits’ and ‘Politics is in your pants’. Rahul ji should continue doing the good work he is doing. For BJP,” he told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rahul_Gandhi_tired-300x231.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-takes-retirement-from-vacationing-after-running-out-of-places-to-vacation-7838,Rahul Gandhi takes retirement from vacationing after running out of places to vacation,,1429165622.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kashmiri-separatists-laud-800-valmikis-ask-pandits-to-learn-from-them-7835,"Srinagar. Immediately after more than 800 Valmikis converted to Islam in SP leader Azam Khan’s constituency Rampur of Uttar Pradesh to prevent their houses from getting demolished, Kashmiri separatists lauded their move and hailed the effort taken by them to save their houses.

However not just stopping at that, the separatists asked Kashmiri Pandits to take a cue from these Valmikis and learn from this incident.

“All this talk of Kashmiri Pandits being extremely attached to their native homes is bullshit. If they really were so desperate to save their homeland and houses, they would not have thought twice before doing what Valmikis did,” veteran separatist Yasin Malik told Faking News.

“In fact these Pandits chose their faith over their homes. For them their religion came first,” he continued.

“And it is because we didn’t want Kashmir to turn into a non-secular place; some of us were forced to drive these communal species out of the valley with heavy heart,” he further claimed.

Yasin’s reaction when asked if he would advise same to Muslims in Gaza.

To further strengthen his claims, Malik pointed to frequent stone pelting incidents that people of his ilk had to unfortunately resort to.

“Our brothers tried to get a response out of them many a times by throwing stones at their houses, windows etc. If they had even little bit of attachment to their property, they would have reacted or revolted, but they didn’t. It further confirmed our doubts that for them religion is more important,” Yasin said.

“In fact we love their property more than they ever loved it,” he said pointing to the number of Kashmiris staying in those houses now.

Separatists however claimed that the offer to come back was still on for Pandits if they mend their ways.

“If they do what Valmikis did in Rampur, that would prove their love for their homeland and we would immediately vacate their houses,” said another separatist cum terrorist Masarat Alam.

“Also it would be the real ghar wapsi,” he chuckled.

The separatists further offered those houses to those 800 Valmikis in case Pandits choose to remain communal.

“We have been hearing that even after embracing Islam, these 800 Valmikis could still be forced to vacate their places. In that case, they can come and live with us in Kashmir in harmony. This proves we are definitely not heartless,” Alam added.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yasin-malik-300x169.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kashmiri-separatists-laud-800-valmikis-ask-pandits-to-learn-from-them-7835,"Kashmiri separatists laud 800 Valmikis for converting to Islam, ask Pandits to learn from them",,1429082654.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

We met him in the backdrops of stone throwing event in the heart of this city.

Faking News Reporter (FNR): Salaam Assin.

Assin Malick (AM): Salaam Fekus.

FNR: Why do you oppose a separate township for Kashmiri Pandits?

AM: That is a very bad decision. A township based on religion is detrimental to a state (Kashmir) that is not based on religion. Also since Hindu males always grow in India, that township alone will prosper while we will remain poor as usual.

FNR: So do you want Kashmiri Pandits to live with you?

AM: Of course. We invite them to come back to their houses and live like they did before 1990. We don’t have Jagmohan here now so they will not be forced to move to India by the Indian government.

Kashmiri Pandits can become good batsmen if they can defend the stones being pelted for practice by Kashmiriyats. This is good for Indian cricket.

FNR: What about their homes?

AM: We got those homes after Kashmiri Pandits left them for a long vacation. We are a ‘forever poor people’ you know. Imagine the torture we have to undergo to maintain such homes? We will be glad to sell those homes back to returning KPs once they return.

FNR: What benefits they will get by living with you people?

AM: What is this question bhai? They can learn how to throw stone from our brothers. They can learn about projectile physics by observing stone throwing. They can learn about poking and then playing victim upon retaliation as they suck at that.

FNR: If you could allow them to live with you guys, why not allow them to Amarnath yatra or Kausar Nag?

AM: That will cause climate change. You know global warming? Even last year, thoughts of Kashmiri Pandits caused the devastating Kashmir floods. We don’t want that to happen now. Doing yatra is against rationalism. Inshallah, we are rational atheists and we have got nothing to do with religion alhamdolillah. So, we cannot tolerate such blind faith and superstition.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/08slide1-300x212.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/a-township-based-on-religion-is-detrimental-to-a-state-that-is-not-based-on-religion-assin-malick-7829,A township based on religion is detrimental to a state that is not based on religion: Assin Malick,,1428986212.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

According to our sources, recently a delegation of junior ministers of BJP met party president to complain about Modi’s frequent trips. Earlier Modi was visiting countries like Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal which are not far away and to visit these kind of countries, minsters were not too excited. They have gone to these countries for family vacation multiple times in the past.

When the families of the ministers came to know Modi is planning visit to France, Germany and Canada, they were upset. The families know getting a chance to visit such countries is once a life time opportunity.This is also a good time to visit as schools are closed and climate in India is too hot to handle.

Modi on a tour.

As we understand initially party thought about rewarding some hardworking ministers a chance to accompany the PM during the visit. However in an RTI era where every expenditure is captured, party high command did not want take a chance. BJP was also worried as Congress’ entire top leadership team is searching for topics, scams which Rahul can take up immediately on his arrival.

Party president Amit Shahs told our Faking News reporter that like in IT Companies, managers go to client location to show the demo and get the project, Modi is going on foreign visits precisely for the same reason. He cited the recent announcements about France committing two billion euro to India and he claimed this was all due to the hard work of our PM. He expects Modiji will be able to get much bigger projects from Germany and Canada.

According to our sources, party president has assured everyone including MPs who are on bench (currently not working as ministers) that after completion of one year of NDA rule in May, party will start a formal appraisal process. The ones who “exceed expectation” will get a chance to visit the countries of their choice along with their families.

MPs and ministers have requested unlike IT companies where appraisal process runs for more than a quarter, here they need to complete it soon as the schools are going to open in June and their families cannot accompany them if the trips are scheduled late. Party high command has already formed a committee to see that the appraisal process gets over as early as possible.

Meanwhile Aam aadmis are expecting at least now ministers in order to improve their appraisal score, will try to do some work, which will help in improving their quality of life.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13narendra5-273x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/junior-ministers-complain-pm-modi-is-like-it-company-manager-takes-up-all-onsite-opportunities-without-giving-subordinates-chance-7832,"Junior ministers complain PM Modi is like IT company manager, takes up all onsite opportunities without giving subordinates chance",,1428971768.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nehru-snooped-on-bose-to-write-a-biography-on-him-claims-historian-ram-buha-7828,"New Delhi. Historian Ram Buha has confirmed that Jawaharlal Nehru had snooped on Netaji Subash Chandra Bose. While this could be shocking that such a statement comes from an ardent Nehru fan, he reveals that Nehru was snooping on Netaji to write a biography of the latter.

We met Ram Buha at a book launch, where he was explaining to the audience about the glory days of India, when Nehru was its leader. After the speech, we pulled him to a corner and asked his opinions on the recent ‘declassified Netaji files’.

He said, “I was about to talk about this in my speech, but I didn’t have time. Good that you guys asked it. Yes! Nehru was snooping on Subhash Chandra Bose.”

However some sources claim that Nehru’s driver was the one who actually ordered snooping on Bose and Nehru had no idea about it. Nehru’s driver seen here driving tractor.

We were completely taken aback with his admission. Taking us out of shock, he continued, “Actually, Nehru was too bored of being a Prime Minister. He could not take some time off to plan the future of country like his great grandson. RSS was forcing him to remain in India and it took a toll on him. So, he wanted to write a book to let his mind relax and so thought about an biography on Subash Chandra Bose. It was then, he commissioned IB to snoop on Bose and get more details about him. How good a biography will be without sharing letters of the person? For that purpose, he intercepted letters flying between kith & kin of Bose. What is wrong in this? Can’t a person have a liberty to write a book?”

When asked about that book, he said, “Nehru would have completed it, if not for the birth of Modi. Modi was born by the time he completed the first chapter and he had to worry about fighting the rising fascism in India. Poor Nehru was unable to make a book on Bose. But, nevertheless, he kept on collecting information about Bose, so that someone from his family can later write.”

“Actually, Rahul has gone to an undisclosed location to finish writing that book. He will come back with that Bose biography next week probably. Infact, the leak of declassified files also happened due to the efforts of Rahulji. He took files from IB and while trying to put it back, entered into the wrong room, which happened to be National Archives room. Thus, it became declassified by accident,” Buha revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nehru-300x242.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nehru-snooped-on-bose-to-write-a-biography-on-him-claims-historian-ram-buha-7828,"Nehru snooped on Bose to write a biography on him, claims historian Ram Buha",,1428915818.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has plans to visit India soon. He himself announced this to the media yesterday during a press conference on board his flight, some place in the European skies.

He was very excited about it when he said, “Mitron…I am seriously contemplating visiting India shortly. It will be soon after I sign deals with Abkhazia, Palau and Aruba. And visits to Tuvalu and Nauru. India is my homeland and I am keen to be there in the very near future.”

Modi promising India he will be visit it soon.

Answering a reporter he said, “I am very keen on an India trip. So much so that I have been taking tips from US President Barrack Obama and Chinese President Jinping on how many days to spend there and what places to visit. Because they had visited India recently.”

Later on, back in Delhi, the PMO released details of the PM’s plan. “Modiji has been travelling relentlessly for the sake of the country. Out of the 195 countries that exist today, he has visited most of them. There are still a few pending, mostly due to technical reasons like the country being too small for his aircraft to land or for accommodating his entourage as their population is smaller than that. We are trying to solve this by seeking the help of neighbouring countries for accommodation. He should be able to cover all the countries in the next few months. So, once all countries are covered, he will certainly head for India.”

Amused by all this, a reporter asked, “Once all the countries are visited, what will Modiji do?”

The spokesperson answered, “We will have to wait and see. He may do follow up visits to monitor the status of deals signed before. And of course there are some new countries that come into existence every now and then when they get independence. We are monitoring such situations in order to add them to the list.”

“What after that?” the reporter further asked.

“Well….we might have to split India into multiple pieces so that he can visit more countries,” the spokesperson replied.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-now-launch-helpline-for-disgruntled-leaders-within-party-7802,"New Delhi. After launching an anti-corruption helpline in Delhi, AAP is now on its way to launch a new helpline where disgruntled leaders within the party can express their concerns.

Sources say that AAP understands that just like corruption is a growing menace in the city, the dissent among leaders within party wrt functioning of the party and other aspects is also growing by the day.

So, in order to cater to such dissent, the party has decided to launch one more helpline where voices of such leaders will be heard.

The call could be diverted to Kejriwal’s number, sources say.

“We are very pleased to inform you that soon the likes of Bhushans and Yadavs will have a platform to register their complaints. They need not write open letters or do meaningless Press Conferences henceforth,” Manish Sisiodia announced in a press meet.

However a faction within AAP claims that by launching such helpline, Kejriwal & Co were only trying to curb the voices of dissent and not catering to them.

“They have clearly told everybody that this would be the only platform to communicate dissent. Concerned addressed anywhere else would be null and void and hence wouldn’t be entertained,” a Yogendra Yadav loyalist cum Yogendra Yadav disclosed.

The faction further pointed to certain features of this yet to be launched helpline to strengthen their claims.

“One of the features of this helpline will be that moment your call is put on hold, Kumar Vishwas’ poetry will start playing in the background,” revealed a Bhushan loyalist.

“Well it’s clear. The idea is to discourage such calls. I mean who would want to ruin his entire day by listening to Kumar Vishwas poetry?” he asked.

However Kejriwal loyalists rubbished such allegations.

“It’s bullshit. If that was the case we would not be contemplating having an option to listen to Ashutosh’s tweets by pressing some number. We surely wan’t to keep callers entertained, in case all our operators are occupied,” Ashish Khetan told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/n-ARVIND-KEJRIWAL-large570-300x125.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-now-launch-helpline-for-disgruntled-leaders-within-party-7802,AAP to now launch helpline for disgruntled leaders within party,,1428304561.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a new sting operation on AAP, the real reason for removing senior members within AAP has been revealed. They have basically adopted this idea from the Indian IT services companies who lay off thousands of employees who become unproductive for them.

Kejriwal realized they had to pay high salaries to senior member of party and also since they were senior, they were not putting in those extra hours and were just taking advantage of their positions.

Kejriwal giving pre-placement talk in a campus in Delhi

Now Kejriwal will be conducting recruitment drives in various MBA and Engineering colleagues of Delhi and would hire individuals in bulk.

When we went to confirm this with Kejriwal, he said, (strictly off record) “We realize that our senior members were not being productive and were creating a lot of trouble. We have taken motivation from one of the most successful industry of India i.e. IT industry. Just like them we have laid off( forced out) few of our senior members and would hire trainees in their spot. This will be a win-win situation for all the people as these trainees would be doing what they are told to do and would not be using any additional mind of their own which can cause trouble to us and along with that we will also be improving the employment percentage in Delhi as we know most of the MBA and engineering students are jobless.”

When asked about senior leader’s future, Kejriwal said, “they are experienced people, they can get a job anywhere easily. They might get even higher package and other perks in companies like BJP and Congress. Our company is just a start up and these are big companies which also offer on site opportunities if you end up in right department.”

Kejriwal then left to prepare the question paper for recruitment drive.

We wanted to get more details about this so our correspondent Kekdekar spoke to Proton Rao who is the chief scientist at BARC.

AAP leaders telling number of people party will be finally left with

Kekdekar : Sir , Do you really think that AAP can replace U235 in our nuclear reactors?

Proton Rao : Certainly, There is a great potential in this radioactive party AAP. The fission rate is the highest till now that we have seen in any other party. There are a few experiments that our scientists are working on and the results have been very promising.

Kekdekar : Can you explain the reasons for this high fission rate?

Proton Rao : The (Dictator) Nucleus of this party has very high charge which makes the Dhokebaaz neutrons volatile. They come out their shells and crash into other imandar positrons. See, that’s the cycle that creates the fission. At times, this becomes uncontrollable. This is a major obstacle that we need to over come.

Kekdekar : How much time will it take before we start using AAP in our nuclear reactors ?

Proton Rao : It is going to take some time. We have found chamcha electrons that stick around Nucleus and control energy of dhokebaaz neutrons. We are working to increase the count of these chamcha electrons. Once we master this process, there is no stopping us.

Kekdekar : Thank you Mr. Proton Rao for spending your valuable time with us and we wish you all the best.

Government of India is very happy with these new developments. They are linking this with the success of Make In India.

Soon after blaming a BJP leader of trying to buy one of its MLAs, AAP organized an emergency workshop to teach its leaders – “money can’t buy true happiness.”

As per AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, this workshop is one of the many precautionary measures which his party is taking to prevent its legislators from getting corrupt.

“Real happiness lies in small little things, like dharna“

“It’s a bad bad world out there, and poachers are roaming all around trying to hunt down our innocent MLAs. But we are not that easy target,” said Kejriwal, while addressing a post-workshop press conference at AAP headquarters. “Swami Vardanand was here and he taught our leaders how irrelevant is money when it comes to finding true happiness.”

Kejriwal further claimed that as a result of attending the workshop, as of now, AAP leaders are one of the most enlightened bunch of politicians in India. “We all learnt a lot and now, for us, money is nothing more than piece of paper,” Kejriwal continued. “Hamare kisi vidhayak ko BMW dikha dein, uske munh se ek waah tak nahi niklegi.”

After completing the workshop, all AAP leaders have been given a certificate declaring them a monk. Reportedly, leaders will be using this certificate if re-election happens in Delhi. “Now, I am an AAP certified monk, and I need nothing else in this world,” boasted an AAP MLA.

Going a step ahead, AAP senior leader and poet Kumar Vishwas called all AAP leaders modern Buddha. “Today, if BJP even offers PM chair to our MLAs, none of them will betray AAP. After all what is a PM chair, it’s just another piece of furniture,” Dr. Vishwas told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,"Chennai. DMK boss Karunanidhi today gave a sharp reply to his critics who were calling him a hypocrite for his Sanskrit originating name despite being a virulent opponent of everything Sanskrit, Hindi, and Hindu.

In a move that comes as a slap on all Hindi speakers, he changed his name from Karunanidhi to Compassion. Karunanidhi alias Compassion, later clarified that he was not aware that ‘Karunanidhi’ was a Sanskrit word, else he would have taken this decision long back and helped Tamil Nadu reach new level of self-respect and self-awareness.

“I am genius”

Sources tell Faking News that Karunanidhi was browsing Facebook early the morning on his smartphone, when he came across a post that described the meaning and origin of the word ‘Karunanidhi’.

The 90-year-old leader immediately flung the phone on the floor with his full force. Out of acute pain, which arose out of this insult to his self-respect, he emitted such a deep and loud cry that people up to the distance of 5 kms were forced out of their sleep. Doctors had to give him sedatives and sleeping pills to control the situation.

But within one hour, he regained his consciousness and ordered for a press conference. He immediately announced that he was changing his name to Compassion to save the Tamil culture. On being asked what the relation is between Tamil culture and the English word Compassion, he didn’t say anything.

When this Faking News reporter asked, “How the word Karunanidhi is against Tamil culture?” Karunanidhi angrily shouted – “DON’T SPEAK THAT WORD.”

Post this revelation by the party patriarch, some DMK supporters are now claiming that they lost the last elections due to the word Karunanidhi’s relation with Sanskrit.

“But better late than never. We have again shown that DMK is the only party which respects Tamil culture. We have left AIADMK miles behind. We challenge Jayalalithaa to change her name,” said an excited supporter of DMK.

If sources are to be believed, Jayalalithaa is very worried due to this incident and is contemplating a similar name change process to show that AIADMK also respects Tamil culture.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/karunanidhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,Karunanidhi changes his name as it had Sanskrit origins and thus against Tamil culture,,1409824412.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After blaming a BJP leader for planting false news of misconduct by his son, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has now hinted at a possible malicious campaign by the opposition Congress party to silently convert BJP members into Congress agents.

Throwing some more light on the alleged campaign, Rajnath Singh coined a new term “Friendship Jihad” and called it a conspiracy by Congress to increase its power and strength inside the Parliament.

A suspected friendship jihadi.

“Members of Friendship Jihad brigade, disguised as Hindu nationalists are meeting BJP leaders and increasing their friendship with them by praising Israel, talking about problems of Kashmiri Pandits, and ranting against Pakistan,” said Rajnath Singh while addressing a press conference, “To increase their impact, many of them wear saffron clothes.”

“After taking BJP leaders in confidence, they invite them to their home for lunch or dinner, where they serve our leaders sedative mixed food. Once they become unconscious, these Congi jihadist make them sit on sofa and they take their photographs with senior Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh and Salman Khurshid, to give an impression that our leaders are chaddi-buddies with them,” the Home Minister claimed that these photographs were later used by the friendship jihadists to blackmail BJP leaders.

“This way our leaders are getting into a trap set by Congress. Afraid of getting exposed publicly, many have started following their orders and planting unfavorable news in media,” Mr. Singh explained how the news about his son appeared in some parts of media.

BJP is still not sure of the extent of damage these friendship jihadists have done. They also suspect some journalists to be part of this “jehad”.

Sources tell Faking News that as a damage control exercise, BJP has issued a circular warning its leaders to stay alert while meeting unknown persons.

Reportedly, while meeting any stranger, all BJP leaders have been asked to perform what they call a “Red Litmus test”, which will reveal if the stranger is a Congress agent or not.

“All they need to do is to start criticizing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the worst possible way. If the stranger’s face turns red with anger, it means he is a friendship jihadist,” explained a senior BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/FrndshpJihadi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajnath-singh-hints-at-friendship-jihad-bjp-members-being-converted-into-congress-agents-6158,"Rajnath Singh hints at ""Friendship Jihad"", BJP members being converted into Congress agents",,1409223005.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After failing to disassociate itself with the then-dead-now-alive RTI activist turned AAP member Chandra Mohan Sharma, AAP now claims that his coming back to life is a proof enough that god is with AAP and its members.

Rubbishing the reports that Chandra Mohan faked his death, party chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a ‘divine intervention that the RTI activist was among us today’.

“Bhaiyon uparwala hamaare saath hai”

“It is a miracle. Tell me one person who survived after being burnt to death. This proves that god/allah/bhagwan/waheguru is with us, and I appeal to Delhi voters to respect god and his wishes by voting for us whenever the elections happen,” Kejriwal argued as he warned Delhiites to ignore God’s wishes at their own peril.

Kejriwal showed Faking News this picture to show how Chandra Mohan Sharma was an active member of AAP, and how AAP’s candle march helped him being brought back to life.

When asked why did they earlier try to distance themselves from Sharma and claim he was not party’s member, Kejriwal shot back, “This is fact proves that we are not publicity hungry people. We just wanted logic to take its own course and did not in any way want undue media attention. But my conscience did not allow me to keep my fellow compatriots in dark for too long. Hence I decided to tell them the truth.”

Kejriwal further did not see anything wrong in Sharma being spotted in Nepal.

“What’s wrong in that? On the contrary we are glad that not just in India, but our selfless and dedicate members are now fighting for Swaraj and spreading core values of the party in other countries as well,” Kejriwal told our reporter.

This reporter later asked party leader Ashutosh for his comments on Chandra Mohan Sharma cheating death.

“Why are you using the term ‘cheating’? Are you Mudi agent?” Ashutosh retorted.

“Arvind Kejariwal is beautiful like Taj Mahal, and Chandra Mohan has Moon in his name. Taj Mahal needs Moon for its beauty. Ignore Mohan as India is a secular country. And RSS should be banned,” he concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/arvind-kejriwal-press-meet-delhi-360.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-claims-coming-back-to-life-of-chandra-mohan-sharma-a-proof-that-god-is-with-aap-6156,AAP claims coming back to life of Chandra Mohan Sharma a proof that God is with AAP,,1409220326.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With RJD-JDU-Congress alliance in driving seat in Bihar by-polls, Congress is reportedly is in talks with its alliance partners to give partial credit for the victory to party Vice President Rahul Gandhi.

Congress, which won one of the six seats won by the alliance, is trying its best to convince Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar that it was Rahul Gandhi’s charisma that helped to pull off this remarkable comeback post the Lok Sabha debacle.

“kaa kehte ho, de dein credit? Long run mein fayada rahega“

“Whether they believe it or not, but it all happened because of Rahul Gandhi. Although he wasn’t physically present here during the campaign, it was his aura which helped the alliance to defeat BJP,” claimed Anil Mishra, a local Congress leader.

“Congress was the lucky charm in this grand secular alliance, and Rahul Ji is the lucky charm of Congress,” Mishra further claimed.

As winning elections has not been that regular phenomenon with Congress in the last few years, party doesn’t want to miss this opportunity to restore back grassroot workers’ faith in top leadership.

“Finally, Rahul Ji’s magic is working. I always knew he was capable to perform and somewhere deep down even Lalu Ji knows this fact. In his earlier comments during Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Yadav had already expressed his feelings for Rahul Ji,” Digvijay Singh told to Faking News, “All he need to do is to reiterate that once again.”

If party insiders are the be believed, in order to persuade Lalu-Nitish to credit Rahul Gandhi for the win, Congress has also played the minority card.

“Going by the MLA count within the alliance, Congress is certainly in minority. And considering nature of Lalu and Nitish, Congress top leadership is very hopeful that they will give Congress the credit it deserves,” disclosed a close aide of Bihar Congress chief, “It’s time for Lalu-Nitish to walk the talk, they should show the world how much they care for minority.”

Meanwhile, Bihar Congress has already placed hoardings thanking Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi , Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra for the alliance victory in different parts of the state capital.

“Well, Rahul Gandhi surely deserves credit,” a BJP leader said, “For keeping away from Bihar and not campaigning. Else we might have won more seats.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lalu-Nitish.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-in-talks-with-rjd-jdu-to-give-some-credit-to-rahul-gandhi-for-performance-in-bihar-by-polls-6130,Congress in talks with RJD-JDU to give some credit to Rahul Gandhi for performance in Bihar by-polls,,1408962762.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After having contributed massive amount of money through forfeiture of deposit in elections so far, AAP has now filed an RTI to know how and where is the money being used by the Election Commission.

Soon after AAP’s candidate lost his deposit in the just concluded Patiala by-elections, it struck their Stats Specialist Yogendra Yadav, that the party must have contributed of lot through this fashion by now.

He immediately did a quick internal survey and found that AAP as a party has made tremendous contribution to the exchequer by not just losing elections but losing them badly enough.

Arvind showing an estimate of the total amount AAP may have forfeited in deposits by now.

“We have contributed so much in the form of deposit forfeiture in both Lok Sabha and by-polls, that we want to know if that money is being used for welfare of people; if any subsidies are being given through that money or not,” Yogendra Yadav explained the reason behind filing an RTI.

“We have solid evidence that suggests that our money is being consumed by corrupt bureaucrats and politicians of BJP,” Yadav went on to claim.

Yadav however argued that losing deposit was a positive sign and showed how patriotic AAP as a party was.

“Shame on other political parties, specifically the BJP, who have probably made the lowest contribution towards losing deposits,” senior leader Ashutosh pointed out, “This once again proves that Modi is a heartless autocrat who doesn’t care for poor people.”

“We promise to work hard and continue serving more aam aadmis through this manner, even if it requires losing more elections,” Ashutosh further announced, amidst loud cheers from volunteers and supporters gathered at Jantar Mantar and Twitter.

Ashutosh further claimed that such forfeiture of deposits by AAP has led to increase in GDP of the country and hence it was AAP that was bringing the acche din promised by BJP.

When pointed out by our reporter that he was being theoretically incorrect and GDP doesn’t grow like that, he labelled him a paid agent of Modi.

After taking ALS Ice Bucket Challenge earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi challenged his political opponents Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, and senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani to take the chilling bath.

While Rahul and Advani are yet to respond, Aam Aadmi Party has declared the challenge as a political conspiracy to bring back party supremo’s chronic cough problem, which he got rid off recently after a marathon effort.

“It shows how cruel a person Mudi is!!” said a furious Ashutosh making scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “He was well aware of Arvind’s condition, and despite that he did this. It reflects his ill intentions. Daring Kejriwal to take this challenge is like challenging to paint Taj Mahal with black paint!”

Ashutosh further alleged that Modi wanted to wipe out all his opponents.

“By choosing ice, he has proved that he is doing cold blooded murder,” Ashutosh claimed, after which everyone started replying to him on Twitter.

However, in spite of fellow party members’ concerns, Arvind Kejriwal is unperturbed by the possible outcome of accepting the challenge, and has announced to take the dare at Ramlila Maidan on Saturday afternoon.

“I am not going to back off, nahi toh bhaiyon yeh mujhe phir bhagoda bolenege,” the AAP supremo announced, “No matter what happens to me, I will do it for my country, for Swaraj, and also for raising awareness about corruption.”

“I have already sacrificed a lot for India, and compare to all those this Ice Bucket Challenge is nothing. Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge, ai watan tere liye,” Kejriwal said, sending his supporters in frenzy.

Sources tell Faking News that AAP is planning to use this opportunity for to convert the Ice Bucket Challenge in India as another hashtag for the party, apart from attracting media attention.

“On Saturday at Ramlila Maidan, not only Kejriwal, but hundreds of AAP supporter will also be taking up the challenge to show solidarity with their leader,” disclosed a source close to party inner circle, “This time they don’t want Kejriwal to cough alone, they are ready to feel the same pain.”

Buoyed by the success of getting the “Namaste” gesture and “Vande Mataram” dropped from the Independence Day celebrations at a school in Kerala, another secular group, tragically named, Association of Historically Oppressed & Liberal Entities (ASSHOLE) has taken the fight against the idolatry gesture to the tech world.

Controversial “Namaste” emoji

The ASSHOLEs are protesting against the Namaste emoji (pic on the right) on the popular messenger app WhatsApp.

Dozens of ASSHOLEs were seen demonstrating outside the office of Google, which owns the Android OS, on which WhatsApp has been a runaway success.

Speaking to the gathered reporters, ASSHOLE spokesperson Mihir Butt said, “Whenever we use emojis on WhatsApp we are forced to see the Namaste emoji. This is nothing but forcible imposition of Hindu culture on seculars and non-Hindus. We demand that Google suspend WhatsApp from the Play Store with immediate effect until the offending emoji has been taken down.”

Eminent thinker and popular troll-bait Kavita Krishnan also spoke to the media on this issue.

Standing in front of a now defunct BSNL Telegram Office, holding what appeared to be a message to Lenin, Ms Krishnan told the gathered reporters, “This is nothing but pure majoritarianism on the part of WhatsApp and Google. Such blatant communalization of Android has become increasingly noticeable since the appointment of an Internet Hindu, Sundar Pichai as the Head of Android in 2013. This is threatening the secular fabric of the Android platform. WhatsApp is to the PlayStore what ISIS is to Islam.”

She also added that she would be giving up her Android phone and switch to a Nokia 3310, drawing huge applause from everyone present.

“She has sacrificed so much for communal harmony,” a neutral journalist noted.

Former journalist and now part-time AAP spokesperson and full time comedian Ashuosh83B tweeted, “WhatsApp akon has traditionaali been Green and White. Any attempt of Saffronzation of WhatsApp shuld be strongly resisted, (sic)” and “AAP Executive Council has decided to boycott WhatAapp and switch to WeChat #PrayForWeChat.”

The new WhatsApp emoji

Google and WhatsApp have, so far, declined to speak to the press at the time of publication. However they wondered why the protests were not directed at Apple, because WhatsApp was available on iOS too.

“Maybe because these people have a habit of turning a blind eye to at least one party in every case,” a Google employee told Faking News.

A private school in south Kerala has dismissed 25 Hindu students after an unknown (rather we won’t divulge) religious outfit allegedly threatened its management, claiming that the names of the students were against the religious beliefs of a section of the community.

This comes close to the incident of another school in Kerala banning Vande Mataram and Namaste from its Independence Day celebrations, so that the religious sentiments of a community were not hurt.

Initially, PotB Centenary School in Pallam, 65 KMs south of Trivandrum, had around 400 Hindu students among its 1500 students. But, due to pressure from several secular and peaceful organizations, the strength came down to 25 in just 5 years. The school management, however, maintains that this was due to the poor performance of Hindu kids and has nothing to do with their names.

What a communal bunch of kids?

Earlier today, those remaining 25 students too were asked to leave the school. The management again declined that it was due to their religion.

But leader of one of the peaceful organizations, which had asked the school to dismiss the students, was far more candid.

“Imagine our kids calling the names of those Hindu students. It will be like, our kids are reciting the verses of idolaters. This is against our religious beliefs,” the leader claimed.

“Many enraged parents had earlier came to us reporting how their kids kept on chanting unholy names while taking on phone and while playing with those Hindu children. We requested the management to remove these students else we might have to indulge in violence. Our peaceful appeal was accepted,” he added.

When asked about a few names that allegedly offended the religious beliefs, he first sought permission from his God and then laid out a long list, which had few names like “Abishek, Abinav, Balram, Bharath, Deepak, Jagannath, Ram, Krishna, Aarti, Suchitra, etc.”

When contacted, the school management denied any external pressure.

“Those 25 kids failed in maths. They cannot even tell two plus two equals four. So, we had to remove them from our school as they were unable to satisfy our intelligence criteria. It has nothing to do with external pressure,” an administrator of the school said.

Meanwhile many secular organizations have wondered why Hindu parents were naming their kids in a way that was offensive to fellow Indians.

“There are millions of names they could have chosen from. Why are they picking up these names only? It is like forcing kids from other religion to recite religious names. Hindus should learn tolerance and inclusiveness,” a secular person told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chandigarh-kids_1706561i.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kerala-school-expels-hindu-students-as-calling-their-names-offends-religious-sentiments-6071,"Kerala school expels Hindu students, as calling their names offends religious sentiments",,1408189231.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The party plans to open a “U-turn University” in the city with the aim to produce world class u-turners, who will shine in areas like politics, economics, driving, and other facets of life.

AAP chief teaching young students nuances of a steep u-turn.

“We fear that after legendary Kejriwal ji decides to call it a day, we wouldn’t be left with any talented u-turner to fill up the void and his big shoes chappals,” an AAP member explained how the move will help AAP, and thus the humanity.

While AAP supremo Kejriwal would obviously oversee the progress, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh, the original u-turn enthusiast, has been roped in in the capacity of a consultant.

“When Wasim Akram can give tips to Indian fast bowlers, why can’t Netaji break political barriers for a good cause?” an AAP member shot back when asked if the invitation to Netaji meant SP and AAP were bhai bhai.

The curriculum will include u-turn programs in choc-a-bloc Chandani Cowk roads, where students will be asked to make u-turns in peak hours.

AAP members are of the opinion that not only in politics, such u-turns will be of great use even in personal and professional lives of a person.

“You can resign from your job in the morning, go home and relax, and then come back in the evening and claim you never resigned!” an enthusiastic AAP member explained the benefits to lure candidates.

“You can even strengthen your personal relationships at home by telling your wife you never had any girlfriend before her,” he explained how u-turns can bring greatest of the turns in one’s life.

Sources tell Faking News that the party is not going to stop at this and is committed to share their expertise and talent with others. After protests and u-turns, another center is being planned where people will be taught how to successfully trend hashtags on Twitter.

After Rahul Gandhi accused Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan of being biased towards BJP for not allowing him to speak inside the Parliament, many Congress leaders are afraid that Lok Sabha speaker may allow Rahul to speak.

Being Congress MPs, they are not openly expressing their views against their lord Vice President, but a couple of them did accept on the condition of anonymity.

Sources say that despite running along with Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha well today protesting that Congress was not allowed to speak, party MPs were afraid of the consequences.

This is what most Congress MPs want.

“Last time when Rahul Ji tried to speak, our MPs count reduced from 206 to 44. That’s why we don’t want to take such a risk again. Who knows, our strength could further get reduced to 24,” Ramkhilawan Singh (imaginary name of a Congress MP) told Faking News.

Ramkhilawan Singh claims that he and other MPs pray to god daily that Rahul Gandhi falls asleep in the Parliament so that things don’t get worse for the party.

“His habit of sleeping during Lok Sabha proceedings is a huge respite for us. Even though the party faced a lot of ridicule when visuals of him sleeping were broadcast on TV, believe me, it’s a blessing in disguise,” the MP said, claiming that the benefits derived from a sleeping Rahul Gandhi were far more than any of those derived from a speaking Rahul Gandhi.

Ramkhilawan’s confession has led to rumors that some Congress MPs have been adding sedative to Rahul Gandhi’s breakfast.

“You know why opposition was outraging when Rahul Gandhi was caught sleeping? Because they wanted him to speak; obviously for their own benefits,” another Congress MP claimed.

The decision to induct these failed candidates was taken after the union government made it clear that it would not scrap CSAT this year and there will not by any further changes to the exam pattern.

Justifying the decision, Yogendra Yadav called these protesters budding aam anarchists of the country, talent and efforts of whom he felt needed recognition. “There is a ‘rant’ in aspirant,” Mr. Yadav pointed out the inherent requirement.

It gave me a sense of déjà vu and reminded me of the demands we would make every now then, even when we were in power,” a senior leader of AAP told Faking News, “They have already proved their mettle and deserve a shot at highest level, which we are committed to provide them.”

When pointed that the protests by UPSC aspirants did not result into their demands being met, he shot back, “So when have our protests resulted into anything concrete?”

AAP insisted that it was a win-win situation for both the party and the aspirants.

“While we will get a skilled workforce at our disposal on whom we’ll not have to spend much time on training and development; these aspirants stand to sharpen their protesting skills in the company of legendary protestors like Ashutosh, Somnath Bharti etc.,” Manish Sisodia explained while getting voter cards of aspirants transferred to Delhi address.

But we are not that easy target,” said Kejriwal, while addressing a post-workshop press conference at AAP headquarters. “Swami Vardanand was here and he taught our leaders how irrelevant is money when it comes to finding true happiness.”

After completing the workshop, all AAP leaders have been given a certificate declaring them a monk. Reportedly, leaders will be using this certificate if re-election happens in Delhi. “Now, I am an AAP certified monk, and I need nothing else in this world,” boasted an AAP MLA.

Going a step ahead, AAP senior leader and poet Kumar Vishwas called all AAP leaders modern Buddha. “Today, if BJP even offers PM chair to our MLAs, none of them will betray AAP. After all what is a PM chair, it’s just another piece of furniture,” Dr. Vishwas told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,"Chennai. DMK boss Karunanidhi today gave a sharp reply to his critics who were calling him a hypocrite for his Sanskrit originating name despite being a virulent opponent of everything Sanskrit, Hindi, and Hindu.

In a move that comes as a slap on all Hindi speakers, he changed his name from Karunanidhi to Compassion. Karunanidhi alias Compassion, later clarified that he was not aware that ‘Karunanidhi’ was a Sanskrit word, else he would have taken this decision long back and helped Tamil Nadu reach new level of self-respect and self-awareness.

“I am genius”

Sources tell Faking News that Karunanidhi was browsing Facebook early the morning on his smartphone, when he came across a post that described the meaning and origin of the word ‘Karunanidhi’.

The 90-year-old leader immediately flung the phone on the floor with his full force. Out of acute pain, which arose out of this insult to his self-respect, he emitted such a deep and loud cry that people up to the distance of 5 kms were forced out of their sleep. Doctors had to give him sedatives and sleeping pills to control the situation.

But within one hour, he regained his consciousness and ordered for a press conference. He immediately announced that he was changing his name to Compassion to save the Tamil culture. On being asked what the relation is between Tamil culture and the English word Compassion, he didn’t say anything.

When this Faking News reporter asked, “How the word Karunanidhi is against Tamil culture?” Karunanidhi angrily shouted – “DON’T SPEAK THAT WORD.”

Post this revelation by the party patriarch, some DMK supporters are now claiming that they lost the last elections due to the word Karunanidhi’s relation with Sanskrit.

“But better late than never. We have again shown that DMK is the only party which respects Tamil culture. We have left AIADMK miles behind. We challenge Jayalalithaa to change her name,” said an excited supporter of DMK.

If sources are to be believed, Jayalalithaa is very worried due to this incident and is contemplating a similar name change process to show that AIADMK also respects Tamil culture.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/karunanidhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,Karunanidhi changes his name as it had Sanskrit origins and thus against Tamil culture,,1409824412.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After blaming a BJP leader for planting false news of misconduct by his son, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has now hinted at a possible malicious campaign by the opposition Congress party to silently convert BJP members into Congress agents.

Throwing some more light on the alleged campaign, Rajnath Singh coined a new term “Friendship Jihad” and called it a conspiracy by Congress to increase its power and strength inside the Parliament.

A suspected friendship jihadi.

“Members of Friendship Jihad brigade, disguised as Hindu nationalists are meeting BJP leaders and increasing their friendship with them by praising Israel, talking about problems of Kashmiri Pandits, and ranting against Pakistan,” said Rajnath Singh while addressing a press conference, “To increase their impact, many of them wear saffron clothes.”

“After taking BJP leaders in confidence, they invite them to their home for lunch or dinner, where they serve our leaders sedative mixed food. Once they become unconscious, these Congi jihadist make them sit on sofa and they take their photographs with senior Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh and Salman Khurshid, to give an impression that our leaders are chaddi-buddies with them,” the Home Minister claimed that these photographs were later used by the friendship jihadists to blackmail BJP leaders.

“This way our leaders are getting into a trap set by Congress. Afraid of getting exposed publicly, many have started following their orders and planting unfavorable news in media,” Mr. Singh explained how the news about his son appeared in some parts of media.

BJP is still not sure of the extent of damage these friendship jihadists have done. They also suspect some journalists to be part of this “jehad”.

Sources tell Faking News that as a damage control exercise, BJP has issued a circular warning its leaders to stay alert while meeting unknown persons.

Reportedly, while meeting any stranger, all BJP leaders have been asked to perform what they call a “Red Litmus test”, which will reveal if the stranger is a Congress agent or not.

“All they need to do is to start criticizing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the worst possible way. If the stranger’s face turns red with anger, it means he is a friendship jihadist,” explained a senior BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/FrndshpJihadi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajnath-singh-hints-at-friendship-jihad-bjp-members-being-converted-into-congress-agents-6158,"Rajnath Singh hints at ""Friendship Jihad"", BJP members being converted into Congress agents",,1409223005.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After failing to disassociate itself with the then-dead-now-alive RTI activist turned AAP member Chandra Mohan Sharma, AAP now claims that his coming back to life is a proof enough that god is with AAP and its members.

Rubbishing the reports that Chandra Mohan faked his death, party chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a ‘divine intervention that the RTI activist was among us today’.

“Bhaiyon uparwala hamaare saath hai”

“It is a miracle. Tell me one person who survived after being burnt to death. This proves that god/allah/bhagwan/waheguru is with us, and I appeal to Delhi voters to respect god and his wishes by voting for us whenever the elections happen,” Kejriwal argued as he warned Delhiites to ignore God’s wishes at their own peril.

Kejriwal showed Faking News this picture to show how Chandra Mohan Sharma was an active member of AAP, and how AAP’s candle march helped him being brought back to life.

When asked why did they earlier try to distance themselves from Sharma and claim he was not party’s member, Kejriwal shot back, “This is fact proves that we are not publicity hungry people. We just wanted logic to take its own course and did not in any way want undue media attention. But my conscience did not allow me to keep my fellow compatriots in dark for too long. Hence I decided to tell them the truth.”

Kejriwal further did not see anything wrong in Sharma being spotted in Nepal.

“What’s wrong in that? On the contrary we are glad that not just in India, but our selfless and dedicate members are now fighting for Swaraj and spreading core values of the party in other countries as well,” Kejriwal told our reporter.

This reporter later asked party leader Ashutosh for his comments on Chandra Mohan Sharma cheating death.

“Why are you using the term ‘cheating’? Are you Mudi agent?” Ashutosh retorted.

“Arvind Kejariwal is beautiful like Taj Mahal, and Chandra Mohan has Moon in his name. Taj Mahal needs Moon for its beauty. Ignore Mohan as India is a secular country. And RSS should be banned,” he concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/arvind-kejriwal-press-meet-delhi-360.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-claims-coming-back-to-life-of-chandra-mohan-sharma-a-proof-that-god-is-with-aap-6156,AAP claims coming back to life of Chandra Mohan Sharma a proof that God is with AAP,,1409220326.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With RJD-JDU-Congress alliance in driving seat in Bihar by-polls, Congress is reportedly is in talks with its alliance partners to give partial credit for the victory to party Vice President Rahul Gandhi.

Congress, which won one of the six seats won by the alliance, is trying its best to convince Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar that it was Rahul Gandhi’s charisma that helped to pull off this remarkable comeback post the Lok Sabha debacle.

“kaa kehte ho, de dein credit? Long run mein fayada rahega“

“Whether they believe it or not, but it all happened because of Rahul Gandhi. Although he wasn’t physically present here during the campaign, it was his aura which helped the alliance to defeat BJP,” claimed Anil Mishra, a local Congress leader.

“Congress was the lucky charm in this grand secular alliance, and Rahul Ji is the lucky charm of Congress,” Mishra further claimed.

As winning elections has not been that regular phenomenon with Congress in the last few years, party doesn’t want to miss this opportunity to restore back grassroot workers’ faith in top leadership.

“Finally, Rahul Ji’s magic is working. I always knew he was capable to perform and somewhere deep down even Lalu Ji knows this fact. In his earlier comments during Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Yadav had already expressed his feelings for Rahul Ji,” Digvijay Singh told to Faking News, “All he need to do is to reiterate that once again.”

If party insiders are the be believed, in order to persuade Lalu-Nitish to credit Rahul Gandhi for the win, Congress has also played the minority card.

“Going by the MLA count within the alliance, Congress is certainly in minority. And considering nature of Lalu and Nitish, Congress top leadership is very hopeful that they will give Congress the credit it deserves,” disclosed a close aide of Bihar Congress chief, “It’s time for Lalu-Nitish to walk the talk, they should show the world how much they care for minority.”

Meanwhile, Bihar Congress has already placed hoardings thanking Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi , Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra for the alliance victory in different parts of the state capital.

“Well, Rahul Gandhi surely deserves credit,” a BJP leader said, “For keeping away from Bihar and not campaigning. Else we might have won more seats.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lalu-Nitish.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-in-talks-with-rjd-jdu-to-give-some-credit-to-rahul-gandhi-for-performance-in-bihar-by-polls-6130,Congress in talks with RJD-JDU to give some credit to Rahul Gandhi for performance in Bihar by-polls,,1408962762.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After having contributed massive amount of money through forfeiture of deposit in elections so far, AAP has now filed an RTI to know how and where is the money being used by the Election Commission.

Soon after AAP’s candidate lost his deposit in the just concluded Patiala by-elections, it struck their Stats Specialist Yogendra Yadav, that the party must have contributed of lot through this fashion by now.

He immediately did a quick internal survey and found that AAP as a party has made tremendous contribution to the exchequer by not just losing elections but losing them badly enough.

Arvind showing an estimate of the total amount AAP may have forfeited in deposits by now.

“We have contributed so much in the form of deposit forfeiture in both Lok Sabha and by-polls, that we want to know if that money is being used for welfare of people; if any subsidies are being given through that money or not,” Yogendra Yadav explained the reason behind filing an RTI.

“We have solid evidence that suggests that our money is being consumed by corrupt bureaucrats and politicians of BJP,” Yadav went on to claim.

Yadav however argued that losing deposit was a positive sign and showed how patriotic AAP as a party was.

“Shame on other political parties, specifically the BJP, who have probably made the lowest contribution towards losing deposits,” senior leader Ashutosh pointed out, “This once again proves that Modi is a heartless autocrat who doesn’t care for poor people.”

“We promise to work hard and continue serving more aam aadmis through this manner, even if it requires losing more elections,” Ashutosh further announced, amidst loud cheers from volunteers and supporters gathered at Jantar Mantar and Twitter.

Ashutosh further claimed that such forfeiture of deposits by AAP has led to increase in GDP of the country and hence it was AAP that was bringing the acche din promised by BJP.

When pointed out by our reporter that he was being theoretically incorrect and GDP doesn’t grow like that, he labelled him a paid agent of Modi.

After taking ALS Ice Bucket Challenge earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi challenged his political opponents Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, and senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani to take the chilling bath.

While Rahul and Advani are yet to respond, Aam Aadmi Party has declared the challenge as a political conspiracy to bring back party supremo’s chronic cough problem, which he got rid off recently after a marathon effort.

“It shows how cruel a person Mudi is!!” said a furious Ashutosh making scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “He was well aware of Arvind’s condition, and despite that he did this. It reflects his ill intentions. Daring Kejriwal to take this challenge is like challenging to paint Taj Mahal with black paint!”

Ashutosh further alleged that Modi wanted to wipe out all his opponents.

“By choosing ice, he has proved that he is doing cold blooded murder,” Ashutosh claimed, after which everyone started replying to him on Twitter.

However, in spite of fellow party members’ concerns, Arvind Kejriwal is unperturbed by the possible outcome of accepting the challenge, and has announced to take the dare at Ramlila Maidan on Saturday afternoon.

“I am not going to back off, nahi toh bhaiyon yeh mujhe phir bhagoda bolenege,” the AAP supremo announced, “No matter what happens to me, I will do it for my country, for Swaraj, and also for raising awareness about corruption.”

“I have already sacrificed a lot for India, and compare to all those this Ice Bucket Challenge is nothing. Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge, ai watan tere liye,” Kejriwal said, sending his supporters in frenzy.

Sources tell Faking News that AAP is planning to use this opportunity for to convert the Ice Bucket Challenge in India as another hashtag for the party, apart from attracting media attention.

“On Saturday at Ramlila Maidan, not only Kejriwal, but hundreds of AAP supporter will also be taking up the challenge to show solidarity with their leader,” disclosed a source close to party inner circle, “This time they don’t want Kejriwal to cough alone, they are ready to feel the same pain.”

Buoyed by the success of getting the “Namaste” gesture and “Vande Mataram” dropped from the Independence Day celebrations at a school in Kerala, another secular group, tragically named, Association of Historically Oppressed & Liberal Entities (ASSHOLE) has taken the fight against the idolatry gesture to the tech world.

Controversial “Namaste” emoji

The ASSHOLEs are protesting against the Namaste emoji (pic on the right) on the popular messenger app WhatsApp.

Dozens of ASSHOLEs were seen demonstrating outside the office of Google, which owns the Android OS, on which WhatsApp has been a runaway success.

Speaking to the gathered reporters, ASSHOLE spokesperson Mihir Butt said, “Whenever we use emojis on WhatsApp we are forced to see the Namaste emoji. This is nothing but forcible imposition of Hindu culture on seculars and non-Hindus. We demand that Google suspend WhatsApp from the Play Store with immediate effect until the offending emoji has been taken down.”

Eminent thinker and popular troll-bait Kavita Krishnan also spoke to the media on this issue.

Standing in front of a now defunct BSNL Telegram Office, holding what appeared to be a message to Lenin, Ms Krishnan told the gathered reporters, “This is nothing but pure majoritarianism on the part of WhatsApp and Google. Such blatant communalization of Android has become increasingly noticeable since the appointment of an Internet Hindu, Sundar Pichai as the Head of Android in 2013. This is threatening the secular fabric of the Android platform. WhatsApp is to the PlayStore what ISIS is to Islam.”

She also added that she would be giving up her Android phone and switch to a Nokia 3310, drawing huge applause from everyone present.

“She has sacrificed so much for communal harmony,” a neutral journalist noted.

Former journalist and now part-time AAP spokesperson and full time comedian Ashuosh83B tweeted, “WhatsApp akon has traditionaali been Green and White. Any attempt of Saffronzation of WhatsApp shuld be strongly resisted, (sic)” and “AAP Executive Council has decided to boycott WhatAapp and switch to WeChat #PrayForWeChat.”

The new WhatsApp emoji

Google and WhatsApp have, so far, declined to speak to the press at the time of publication. However they wondered why the protests were not directed at Apple, because WhatsApp was available on iOS too.

“Maybe because these people have a habit of turning a blind eye to at least one party in every case,” a Google employee told Faking News.

A private school in south Kerala has dismissed 25 Hindu students after an unknown (rather we won’t divulge) religious outfit allegedly threatened its management, claiming that the names of the students were against the religious beliefs of a section of the community.

This comes close to the incident of another school in Kerala banning Vande Mataram and Namaste from its Independence Day celebrations, so that the religious sentiments of a community were not hurt.

Initially, PotB Centenary School in Pallam, 65 KMs south of Trivandrum, had around 400 Hindu students among its 1500 students. But, due to pressure from several secular and peaceful organizations, the strength came down to 25 in just 5 years. The school management, however, maintains that this was due to the poor performance of Hindu kids and has nothing to do with their names.

What a communal bunch of kids?

Earlier today, those remaining 25 students too were asked to leave the school. The management again declined that it was due to their religion.

But leader of one of the peaceful organizations, which had asked the school to dismiss the students, was far more candid.

“Imagine our kids calling the names of those Hindu students. It will be like, our kids are reciting the verses of idolaters. This is against our religious beliefs,” the leader claimed.

“Many enraged parents had earlier came to us reporting how their kids kept on chanting unholy names while taking on phone and while playing with those Hindu children. We requested the management to remove these students else we might have to indulge in violence. Our peaceful appeal was accepted,” he added.

When asked about a few names that allegedly offended the religious beliefs, he first sought permission from his God and then laid out a long list, which had few names like “Abishek, Abinav, Balram, Bharath, Deepak, Jagannath, Ram, Krishna, Aarti, Suchitra, etc.”

When contacted, the school management denied any external pressure.

“Those 25 kids failed in maths. They cannot even tell two plus two equals four. So, we had to remove them from our school as they were unable to satisfy our intelligence criteria. It has nothing to do with external pressure,” an administrator of the school said.

Meanwhile many secular organizations have wondered why Hindu parents were naming their kids in a way that was offensive to fellow Indians.

“There are millions of names they could have chosen from. Why are they picking up these names only? It is like forcing kids from other religion to recite religious names. Hindus should learn tolerance and inclusiveness,” a secular person told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chandigarh-kids_1706561i.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kerala-school-expels-hindu-students-as-calling-their-names-offends-religious-sentiments-6071,"Kerala school expels Hindu students, as calling their names offends religious sentiments",,1408189231.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The party plans to open a “U-turn University” in the city with the aim to produce world class u-turners, who will shine in areas like politics, economics, driving, and other facets of life.

AAP chief teaching young students nuances of a steep u-turn.

“We fear that after legendary Kejriwal ji decides to call it a day, we wouldn’t be left with any talented u-turner to fill up the void and his big shoes chappals,” an AAP member explained how the move will help AAP, and thus the humanity.

While AAP supremo Kejriwal would obviously oversee the progress, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh, the original u-turn enthusiast, has been roped in in the capacity of a consultant.

“When Wasim Akram can give tips to Indian fast bowlers, why can’t Netaji break political barriers for a good cause?” an AAP member shot back when asked if the invitation to Netaji meant SP and AAP were bhai bhai.

The curriculum will include u-turn programs in choc-a-bloc Chandani Cowk roads, where students will be asked to make u-turns in peak hours.

AAP members are of the opinion that not only in politics, such u-turns will be of great use even in personal and professional lives of a person.

“You can resign from your job in the morning, go home and relax, and then come back in the evening and claim you never resigned!” an enthusiastic AAP member explained the benefits to lure candidates.

“You can even strengthen your personal relationships at home by telling your wife you never had any girlfriend before her,” he explained how u-turns can bring greatest of the turns in one’s life.

Sources tell Faking News that the party is not going to stop at this and is committed to share their expertise and talent with others. After protests and u-turns, another center is being planned where people will be taught how to successfully trend hashtags on Twitter.

After Rahul Gandhi accused Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan of being biased towards BJP for not allowing him to speak inside the Parliament, many Congress leaders are afraid that Lok Sabha speaker may allow Rahul to speak.

Being Congress MPs, they are not openly expressing their views against their lord Vice President, but a couple of them did accept on the condition of anonymity.

Sources say that despite running along with Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha well today protesting that Congress was not allowed to speak, party MPs were afraid of the consequences.

This is what most Congress MPs want.

“Last time when Rahul Ji tried to speak, our MPs count reduced from 206 to 44. That’s why we don’t want to take such a risk again. Who knows, our strength could further get reduced to 24,” Ramkhilawan Singh (imaginary name of a Congress MP) told Faking News.

Ramkhilawan Singh claims that he and other MPs pray to god daily that Rahul Gandhi falls asleep in the Parliament so that things don’t get worse for the party.

“His habit of sleeping during Lok Sabha proceedings is a huge respite for us. Even though the party faced a lot of ridicule when visuals of him sleeping were broadcast on TV, believe me, it’s a blessing in disguise,” the MP said, claiming that the benefits derived from a sleeping Rahul Gandhi were far more than any of those derived from a speaking Rahul Gandhi.

Ramkhilawan’s confession has led to rumors that some Congress MPs have been adding sedative to Rahul Gandhi’s breakfast.

“You know why opposition was outraging when Rahul Gandhi was caught sleeping? Because they wanted him to speak; obviously for their own benefits,” another Congress MP claimed.

The decision to induct these failed candidates was taken after the union government made it clear that it would not scrap CSAT this year and there will not by any further changes to the exam pattern.

Justifying the decision, Yogendra Yadav called these protesters budding aam anarchists of the country, talent and efforts of whom he felt needed recognition. “There is a ‘rant’ in aspirant,” Mr. Yadav pointed out the inherent requirement.

It gave me a sense of déjà vu and reminded me of the demands we would make every now then, even when we were in power,” a senior leader of AAP told Faking News, “They have already proved their mettle and deserve a shot at highest level, which we are committed to provide them.”

When pointed that the protests by UPSC aspirants did not result into their demands being met, he shot back, “So when have our protests resulted into anything concrete?”

AAP insisted that it was a win-win situation for both the party and the aspirants.

“While we will get a skilled workforce at our disposal on whom we’ll not have to spend much time on training and development; these aspirants stand to sharpen their protesting skills in the company of legendary protestors like Ashutosh, Somnath Bharti etc.,” Manish Sisodia explained while getting voter cards of aspirants transferred to Delhi address.

But we are not that easy target,” said Kejriwal, while addressing a post-workshop press conference at AAP headquarters. “Swami Vardanand was here and he taught our leaders how irrelevant is money when it comes to finding true happiness.”

After completing the workshop, all AAP leaders have been given a certificate declaring them a monk. Reportedly, leaders will be using this certificate if re-election happens in Delhi. “Now, I am an AAP certified monk, and I need nothing else in this world,” boasted an AAP MLA.

Going a step ahead, AAP senior leader and poet Kumar Vishwas called all AAP leaders modern Buddha. “Today, if BJP even offers PM chair to our MLAs, none of them will betray AAP. After all what is a PM chair, it’s just another piece of furniture,” Dr. Vishwas told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,"Chennai. DMK boss Karunanidhi today gave a sharp reply to his critics who were calling him a hypocrite for his Sanskrit originating name despite being a virulent opponent of everything Sanskrit, Hindi, and Hindu.

In a move that comes as a slap on all Hindi speakers, he changed his name from Karunanidhi to Compassion. Karunanidhi alias Compassion, later clarified that he was not aware that ‘Karunanidhi’ was a Sanskrit word, else he would have taken this decision long back and helped Tamil Nadu reach new level of self-respect and self-awareness.

“I am genius”

Sources tell Faking News that Karunanidhi was browsing Facebook early the morning on his smartphone, when he came across a post that described the meaning and origin of the word ‘Karunanidhi’.

The 90-year-old leader immediately flung the phone on the floor with his full force. Out of acute pain, which arose out of this insult to his self-respect, he emitted such a deep and loud cry that people up to the distance of 5 kms were forced out of their sleep. Doctors had to give him sedatives and sleeping pills to control the situation.

But within one hour, he regained his consciousness and ordered for a press conference. He immediately announced that he was changing his name to Compassion to save the Tamil culture. On being asked what the relation is between Tamil culture and the English word Compassion, he didn’t say anything.

When this Faking News reporter asked, “How the word Karunanidhi is against Tamil culture?” Karunanidhi angrily shouted – “DON’T SPEAK THAT WORD.”

Post this revelation by the party patriarch, some DMK supporters are now claiming that they lost the last elections due to the word Karunanidhi’s relation with Sanskrit.

“But better late than never. We have again shown that DMK is the only party which respects Tamil culture. We have left AIADMK miles behind. We challenge Jayalalithaa to change her name,” said an excited supporter of DMK.

If sources are to be believed, Jayalalithaa is very worried due to this incident and is contemplating a similar name change process to show that AIADMK also respects Tamil culture.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/karunanidhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,Karunanidhi changes his name as it had Sanskrit origins and thus against Tamil culture,,1409824412.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After blaming a BJP leader for planting false news of misconduct by his son, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has now hinted at a possible malicious campaign by the opposition Congress party to silently convert BJP members into Congress agents.

Throwing some more light on the alleged campaign, Rajnath Singh coined a new term “Friendship Jihad” and called it a conspiracy by Congress to increase its power and strength inside the Parliament.

A suspected friendship jihadi.

“Members of Friendship Jihad brigade, disguised as Hindu nationalists are meeting BJP leaders and increasing their friendship with them by praising Israel, talking about problems of Kashmiri Pandits, and ranting against Pakistan,” said Rajnath Singh while addressing a press conference, “To increase their impact, many of them wear saffron clothes.”

“After taking BJP leaders in confidence, they invite them to their home for lunch or dinner, where they serve our leaders sedative mixed food. Once they become unconscious, these Congi jihadist make them sit on sofa and they take their photographs with senior Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh and Salman Khurshid, to give an impression that our leaders are chaddi-buddies with them,” the Home Minister claimed that these photographs were later used by the friendship jihadists to blackmail BJP leaders.

“This way our leaders are getting into a trap set by Congress. Afraid of getting exposed publicly, many have started following their orders and planting unfavorable news in media,” Mr. Singh explained how the news about his son appeared in some parts of media.

BJP is still not sure of the extent of damage these friendship jihadists have done. They also suspect some journalists to be part of this “jehad”.

Sources tell Faking News that as a damage control exercise, BJP has issued a circular warning its leaders to stay alert while meeting unknown persons.

Reportedly, while meeting any stranger, all BJP leaders have been asked to perform what they call a “Red Litmus test”, which will reveal if the stranger is a Congress agent or not.

“All they need to do is to start criticizing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the worst possible way. If the stranger’s face turns red with anger, it means he is a friendship jihadist,” explained a senior BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/FrndshpJihadi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajnath-singh-hints-at-friendship-jihad-bjp-members-being-converted-into-congress-agents-6158,"Rajnath Singh hints at ""Friendship Jihad"", BJP members being converted into Congress agents",,1409223005.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After failing to disassociate itself with the then-dead-now-alive RTI activist turned AAP member Chandra Mohan Sharma, AAP now claims that his coming back to life is a proof enough that god is with AAP and its members.

Rubbishing the reports that Chandra Mohan faked his death, party chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a ‘divine intervention that the RTI activist was among us today’.

“Bhaiyon uparwala hamaare saath hai”

“It is a miracle. Tell me one person who survived after being burnt to death. This proves that god/allah/bhagwan/waheguru is with us, and I appeal to Delhi voters to respect god and his wishes by voting for us whenever the elections happen,” Kejriwal argued as he warned Delhiites to ignore God’s wishes at their own peril.

Kejriwal showed Faking News this picture to show how Chandra Mohan Sharma was an active member of AAP, and how AAP’s candle march helped him being brought back to life.

When asked why did they earlier try to distance themselves from Sharma and claim he was not party’s member, Kejriwal shot back, “This is fact proves that we are not publicity hungry people. We just wanted logic to take its own course and did not in any way want undue media attention. But my conscience did not allow me to keep my fellow compatriots in dark for too long. Hence I decided to tell them the truth.”

Kejriwal further did not see anything wrong in Sharma being spotted in Nepal.

“What’s wrong in that? On the contrary we are glad that not just in India, but our selfless and dedicate members are now fighting for Swaraj and spreading core values of the party in other countries as well,” Kejriwal told our reporter.

This reporter later asked party leader Ashutosh for his comments on Chandra Mohan Sharma cheating death.

“Why are you using the term ‘cheating’? Are you Mudi agent?” Ashutosh retorted.

“Arvind Kejariwal is beautiful like Taj Mahal, and Chandra Mohan has Moon in his name. Taj Mahal needs Moon for its beauty. Ignore Mohan as India is a secular country. And RSS should be banned,” he concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/arvind-kejriwal-press-meet-delhi-360.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-claims-coming-back-to-life-of-chandra-mohan-sharma-a-proof-that-god-is-with-aap-6156,AAP claims coming back to life of Chandra Mohan Sharma a proof that God is with AAP,,1409220326.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With RJD-JDU-Congress alliance in driving seat in Bihar by-polls, Congress is reportedly is in talks with its alliance partners to give partial credit for the victory to party Vice President Rahul Gandhi.

Congress, which won one of the six seats won by the alliance, is trying its best to convince Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar that it was Rahul Gandhi’s charisma that helped to pull off this remarkable comeback post the Lok Sabha debacle.

“kaa kehte ho, de dein credit? Long run mein fayada rahega“

“Whether they believe it or not, but it all happened because of Rahul Gandhi. Although he wasn’t physically present here during the campaign, it was his aura which helped the alliance to defeat BJP,” claimed Anil Mishra, a local Congress leader.

“Congress was the lucky charm in this grand secular alliance, and Rahul Ji is the lucky charm of Congress,” Mishra further claimed.

As winning elections has not been that regular phenomenon with Congress in the last few years, party doesn’t want to miss this opportunity to restore back grassroot workers’ faith in top leadership.

“Finally, Rahul Ji’s magic is working. I always knew he was capable to perform and somewhere deep down even Lalu Ji knows this fact. In his earlier comments during Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Yadav had already expressed his feelings for Rahul Ji,” Digvijay Singh told to Faking News, “All he need to do is to reiterate that once again.”

If party insiders are the be believed, in order to persuade Lalu-Nitish to credit Rahul Gandhi for the win, Congress has also played the minority card.

“Going by the MLA count within the alliance, Congress is certainly in minority. And considering nature of Lalu and Nitish, Congress top leadership is very hopeful that they will give Congress the credit it deserves,” disclosed a close aide of Bihar Congress chief, “It’s time for Lalu-Nitish to walk the talk, they should show the world how much they care for minority.”

Meanwhile, Bihar Congress has already placed hoardings thanking Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi , Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra for the alliance victory in different parts of the state capital.

“Well, Rahul Gandhi surely deserves credit,” a BJP leader said, “For keeping away from Bihar and not campaigning. Else we might have won more seats.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lalu-Nitish.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-in-talks-with-rjd-jdu-to-give-some-credit-to-rahul-gandhi-for-performance-in-bihar-by-polls-6130,Congress in talks with RJD-JDU to give some credit to Rahul Gandhi for performance in Bihar by-polls,,1408962762.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After having contributed massive amount of money through forfeiture of deposit in elections so far, AAP has now filed an RTI to know how and where is the money being used by the Election Commission.

Soon after AAP’s candidate lost his deposit in the just concluded Patiala by-elections, it struck their Stats Specialist Yogendra Yadav, that the party must have contributed of lot through this fashion by now.

He immediately did a quick internal survey and found that AAP as a party has made tremendous contribution to the exchequer by not just losing elections but losing them badly enough.

Arvind showing an estimate of the total amount AAP may have forfeited in deposits by now.

“We have contributed so much in the form of deposit forfeiture in both Lok Sabha and by-polls, that we want to know if that money is being used for welfare of people; if any subsidies are being given through that money or not,” Yogendra Yadav explained the reason behind filing an RTI.

“We have solid evidence that suggests that our money is being consumed by corrupt bureaucrats and politicians of BJP,” Yadav went on to claim.

Yadav however argued that losing deposit was a positive sign and showed how patriotic AAP as a party was.

“Shame on other political parties, specifically the BJP, who have probably made the lowest contribution towards losing deposits,” senior leader Ashutosh pointed out, “This once again proves that Modi is a heartless autocrat who doesn’t care for poor people.”

“We promise to work hard and continue serving more aam aadmis through this manner, even if it requires losing more elections,” Ashutosh further announced, amidst loud cheers from volunteers and supporters gathered at Jantar Mantar and Twitter.

Ashutosh further claimed that such forfeiture of deposits by AAP has led to increase in GDP of the country and hence it was AAP that was bringing the acche din promised by BJP.

When pointed out by our reporter that he was being theoretically incorrect and GDP doesn’t grow like that, he labelled him a paid agent of Modi.

After taking ALS Ice Bucket Challenge earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi challenged his political opponents Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, and senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani to take the chilling bath.

While Rahul and Advani are yet to respond, Aam Aadmi Party has declared the challenge as a political conspiracy to bring back party supremo’s chronic cough problem, which he got rid off recently after a marathon effort.

“It shows how cruel a person Mudi is!!” said a furious Ashutosh making scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “He was well aware of Arvind’s condition, and despite that he did this. It reflects his ill intentions. Daring Kejriwal to take this challenge is like challenging to paint Taj Mahal with black paint!”

Ashutosh further alleged that Modi wanted to wipe out all his opponents.

“By choosing ice, he has proved that he is doing cold blooded murder,” Ashutosh claimed, after which everyone started replying to him on Twitter.

However, in spite of fellow party members’ concerns, Arvind Kejriwal is unperturbed by the possible outcome of accepting the challenge, and has announced to take the dare at Ramlila Maidan on Saturday afternoon.

“I am not going to back off, nahi toh bhaiyon yeh mujhe phir bhagoda bolenege,” the AAP supremo announced, “No matter what happens to me, I will do it for my country, for Swaraj, and also for raising awareness about corruption.”

“I have already sacrificed a lot for India, and compare to all those this Ice Bucket Challenge is nothing. Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge, ai watan tere liye,” Kejriwal said, sending his supporters in frenzy.

Sources tell Faking News that AAP is planning to use this opportunity for to convert the Ice Bucket Challenge in India as another hashtag for the party, apart from attracting media attention.

“On Saturday at Ramlila Maidan, not only Kejriwal, but hundreds of AAP supporter will also be taking up the challenge to show solidarity with their leader,” disclosed a source close to party inner circle, “This time they don’t want Kejriwal to cough alone, they are ready to feel the same pain.”

Buoyed by the success of getting the “Namaste” gesture and “Vande Mataram” dropped from the Independence Day celebrations at a school in Kerala, another secular group, tragically named, Association of Historically Oppressed & Liberal Entities (ASSHOLE) has taken the fight against the idolatry gesture to the tech world.

Controversial “Namaste” emoji

The ASSHOLEs are protesting against the Namaste emoji (pic on the right) on the popular messenger app WhatsApp.

Dozens of ASSHOLEs were seen demonstrating outside the office of Google, which owns the Android OS, on which WhatsApp has been a runaway success.

Speaking to the gathered reporters, ASSHOLE spokesperson Mihir Butt said, “Whenever we use emojis on WhatsApp we are forced to see the Namaste emoji. This is nothing but forcible imposition of Hindu culture on seculars and non-Hindus. We demand that Google suspend WhatsApp from the Play Store with immediate effect until the offending emoji has been taken down.”

Eminent thinker and popular troll-bait Kavita Krishnan also spoke to the media on this issue.

Standing in front of a now defunct BSNL Telegram Office, holding what appeared to be a message to Lenin, Ms Krishnan told the gathered reporters, “This is nothing but pure majoritarianism on the part of WhatsApp and Google. Such blatant communalization of Android has become increasingly noticeable since the appointment of an Internet Hindu, Sundar Pichai as the Head of Android in 2013. This is threatening the secular fabric of the Android platform. WhatsApp is to the PlayStore what ISIS is to Islam.”

She also added that she would be giving up her Android phone and switch to a Nokia 3310, drawing huge applause from everyone present.

“She has sacrificed so much for communal harmony,” a neutral journalist noted.

Former journalist and now part-time AAP spokesperson and full time comedian Ashuosh83B tweeted, “WhatsApp akon has traditionaali been Green and White. Any attempt of Saffronzation of WhatsApp shuld be strongly resisted, (sic)” and “AAP Executive Council has decided to boycott WhatAapp and switch to WeChat #PrayForWeChat.”

The new WhatsApp emoji

Google and WhatsApp have, so far, declined to speak to the press at the time of publication. However they wondered why the protests were not directed at Apple, because WhatsApp was available on iOS too.

“Maybe because these people have a habit of turning a blind eye to at least one party in every case,” a Google employee told Faking News.

A private school in south Kerala has dismissed 25 Hindu students after an unknown (rather we won’t divulge) religious outfit allegedly threatened its management, claiming that the names of the students were against the religious beliefs of a section of the community.

This comes close to the incident of another school in Kerala banning Vande Mataram and Namaste from its Independence Day celebrations, so that the religious sentiments of a community were not hurt.

Initially, PotB Centenary School in Pallam, 65 KMs south of Trivandrum, had around 400 Hindu students among its 1500 students. But, due to pressure from several secular and peaceful organizations, the strength came down to 25 in just 5 years. The school management, however, maintains that this was due to the poor performance of Hindu kids and has nothing to do with their names.

What a communal bunch of kids?

Earlier today, those remaining 25 students too were asked to leave the school. The management again declined that it was due to their religion.

But leader of one of the peaceful organizations, which had asked the school to dismiss the students, was far more candid.

“Imagine our kids calling the names of those Hindu students. It will be like, our kids are reciting the verses of idolaters. This is against our religious beliefs,” the leader claimed.

“Many enraged parents had earlier came to us reporting how their kids kept on chanting unholy names while taking on phone and while playing with those Hindu children. We requested the management to remove these students else we might have to indulge in violence. Our peaceful appeal was accepted,” he added.

When asked about a few names that allegedly offended the religious beliefs, he first sought permission from his God and then laid out a long list, which had few names like “Abishek, Abinav, Balram, Bharath, Deepak, Jagannath, Ram, Krishna, Aarti, Suchitra, etc.”

When contacted, the school management denied any external pressure.

“Those 25 kids failed in maths. They cannot even tell two plus two equals four. So, we had to remove them from our school as they were unable to satisfy our intelligence criteria. It has nothing to do with external pressure,” an administrator of the school said.

Meanwhile many secular organizations have wondered why Hindu parents were naming their kids in a way that was offensive to fellow Indians.

“There are millions of names they could have chosen from. Why are they picking up these names only? It is like forcing kids from other religion to recite religious names. Hindus should learn tolerance and inclusiveness,” a secular person told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chandigarh-kids_1706561i.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kerala-school-expels-hindu-students-as-calling-their-names-offends-religious-sentiments-6071,"Kerala school expels Hindu students, as calling their names offends religious sentiments",,1408189231.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The party plans to open a “U-turn University” in the city with the aim to produce world class u-turners, who will shine in areas like politics, economics, driving, and other facets of life.

AAP chief teaching young students nuances of a steep u-turn.

“We fear that after legendary Kejriwal ji decides to call it a day, we wouldn’t be left with any talented u-turner to fill up the void and his big shoes chappals,” an AAP member explained how the move will help AAP, and thus the humanity.

While AAP supremo Kejriwal would obviously oversee the progress, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh, the original u-turn enthusiast, has been roped in in the capacity of a consultant.

“When Wasim Akram can give tips to Indian fast bowlers, why can’t Netaji break political barriers for a good cause?” an AAP member shot back when asked if the invitation to Netaji meant SP and AAP were bhai bhai.

The curriculum will include u-turn programs in choc-a-bloc Chandani Cowk roads, where students will be asked to make u-turns in peak hours.

AAP members are of the opinion that not only in politics, such u-turns will be of great use even in personal and professional lives of a person.

“You can resign from your job in the morning, go home and relax, and then come back in the evening and claim you never resigned!” an enthusiastic AAP member explained the benefits to lure candidates.

“You can even strengthen your personal relationships at home by telling your wife you never had any girlfriend before her,” he explained how u-turns can bring greatest of the turns in one’s life.

Sources tell Faking News that the party is not going to stop at this and is committed to share their expertise and talent with others. After protests and u-turns, another center is being planned where people will be taught how to successfully trend hashtags on Twitter.

After Rahul Gandhi accused Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan of being biased towards BJP for not allowing him to speak inside the Parliament, many Congress leaders are afraid that Lok Sabha speaker may allow Rahul to speak.

Being Congress MPs, they are not openly expressing their views against their lord Vice President, but a couple of them did accept on the condition of anonymity.

Sources say that despite running along with Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha well today protesting that Congress was not allowed to speak, party MPs were afraid of the consequences.

This is what most Congress MPs want.

“Last time when Rahul Ji tried to speak, our MPs count reduced from 206 to 44. That’s why we don’t want to take such a risk again. Who knows, our strength could further get reduced to 24,” Ramkhilawan Singh (imaginary name of a Congress MP) told Faking News.

Ramkhilawan Singh claims that he and other MPs pray to god daily that Rahul Gandhi falls asleep in the Parliament so that things don’t get worse for the party.

“His habit of sleeping during Lok Sabha proceedings is a huge respite for us. Even though the party faced a lot of ridicule when visuals of him sleeping were broadcast on TV, believe me, it’s a blessing in disguise,” the MP said, claiming that the benefits derived from a sleeping Rahul Gandhi were far more than any of those derived from a speaking Rahul Gandhi.

Ramkhilawan’s confession has led to rumors that some Congress MPs have been adding sedative to Rahul Gandhi’s breakfast.

“You know why opposition was outraging when Rahul Gandhi was caught sleeping? Because they wanted him to speak; obviously for their own benefits,” another Congress MP claimed.

The decision to induct these failed candidates was taken after the union government made it clear that it would not scrap CSAT this year and there will not by any further changes to the exam pattern.

Justifying the decision, Yogendra Yadav called these protesters budding aam anarchists of the country, talent and efforts of whom he felt needed recognition. “There is a ‘rant’ in aspirant,” Mr. Yadav pointed out the inherent requirement.

It gave me a sense of déjà vu and reminded me of the demands we would make every now then, even when we were in power,” a senior leader of AAP told Faking News, “They have already proved their mettle and deserve a shot at highest level, which we are committed to provide them.”

When pointed that the protests by UPSC aspirants did not result into their demands being met, he shot back, “So when have our protests resulted into anything concrete?”

AAP insisted that it was a win-win situation for both the party and the aspirants.

“While we will get a skilled workforce at our disposal on whom we’ll not have to spend much time on training and development; these aspirants stand to sharpen their protesting skills in the company of legendary protestors like Ashutosh, Somnath Bharti etc.,” Manish Sisodia explained while getting voter cards of aspirants transferred to Delhi address.

But we are not that easy target,” said Kejriwal, while addressing a post-workshop press conference at AAP headquarters. “Swami Vardanand was here and he taught our leaders how irrelevant is money when it comes to finding true happiness.”

After completing the workshop, all AAP leaders have been given a certificate declaring them a monk. Reportedly, leaders will be using this certificate if re-election happens in Delhi. “Now, I am an AAP certified monk, and I need nothing else in this world,” boasted an AAP MLA.

Going a step ahead, AAP senior leader and poet Kumar Vishwas called all AAP leaders modern Buddha. “Today, if BJP even offers PM chair to our MLAs, none of them will betray AAP. After all what is a PM chair, it’s just another piece of furniture,” Dr. Vishwas told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,"Chennai. DMK boss Karunanidhi today gave a sharp reply to his critics who were calling him a hypocrite for his Sanskrit originating name despite being a virulent opponent of everything Sanskrit, Hindi, and Hindu.

In a move that comes as a slap on all Hindi speakers, he changed his name from Karunanidhi to Compassion. Karunanidhi alias Compassion, later clarified that he was not aware that ‘Karunanidhi’ was a Sanskrit word, else he would have taken this decision long back and helped Tamil Nadu reach new level of self-respect and self-awareness.

“I am genius”

Sources tell Faking News that Karunanidhi was browsing Facebook early the morning on his smartphone, when he came across a post that described the meaning and origin of the word ‘Karunanidhi’.

The 90-year-old leader immediately flung the phone on the floor with his full force. Out of acute pain, which arose out of this insult to his self-respect, he emitted such a deep and loud cry that people up to the distance of 5 kms were forced out of their sleep. Doctors had to give him sedatives and sleeping pills to control the situation.

But within one hour, he regained his consciousness and ordered for a press conference. He immediately announced that he was changing his name to Compassion to save the Tamil culture. On being asked what the relation is between Tamil culture and the English word Compassion, he didn’t say anything.

When this Faking News reporter asked, “How the word Karunanidhi is against Tamil culture?” Karunanidhi angrily shouted – “DON’T SPEAK THAT WORD.”

Post this revelation by the party patriarch, some DMK supporters are now claiming that they lost the last elections due to the word Karunanidhi’s relation with Sanskrit.

“But better late than never. We have again shown that DMK is the only party which respects Tamil culture. We have left AIADMK miles behind. We challenge Jayalalithaa to change her name,” said an excited supporter of DMK.

If sources are to be believed, Jayalalithaa is very worried due to this incident and is contemplating a similar name change process to show that AIADMK also respects Tamil culture.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/karunanidhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-changes-his-name-as-it-had-sanskrit-origins-and-thus-against-tamil-culture-6211,Karunanidhi changes his name as it had Sanskrit origins and thus against Tamil culture,,1409824412.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After blaming a BJP leader for planting false news of misconduct by his son, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has now hinted at a possible malicious campaign by the opposition Congress party to silently convert BJP members into Congress agents.

Throwing some more light on the alleged campaign, Rajnath Singh coined a new term “Friendship Jihad” and called it a conspiracy by Congress to increase its power and strength inside the Parliament.

A suspected friendship jihadi.

“Members of Friendship Jihad brigade, disguised as Hindu nationalists are meeting BJP leaders and increasing their friendship with them by praising Israel, talking about problems of Kashmiri Pandits, and ranting against Pakistan,” said Rajnath Singh while addressing a press conference, “To increase their impact, many of them wear saffron clothes.”

“After taking BJP leaders in confidence, they invite them to their home for lunch or dinner, where they serve our leaders sedative mixed food. Once they become unconscious, these Congi jihadist make them sit on sofa and they take their photographs with senior Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh and Salman Khurshid, to give an impression that our leaders are chaddi-buddies with them,” the Home Minister claimed that these photographs were later used by the friendship jihadists to blackmail BJP leaders.

“This way our leaders are getting into a trap set by Congress. Afraid of getting exposed publicly, many have started following their orders and planting unfavorable news in media,” Mr. Singh explained how the news about his son appeared in some parts of media.

BJP is still not sure of the extent of damage these friendship jihadists have done. They also suspect some journalists to be part of this “jehad”.

Sources tell Faking News that as a damage control exercise, BJP has issued a circular warning its leaders to stay alert while meeting unknown persons.

Reportedly, while meeting any stranger, all BJP leaders have been asked to perform what they call a “Red Litmus test”, which will reveal if the stranger is a Congress agent or not.

“All they need to do is to start criticizing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the worst possible way. If the stranger’s face turns red with anger, it means he is a friendship jihadist,” explained a senior BJP leader.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/FrndshpJihadi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rajnath-singh-hints-at-friendship-jihad-bjp-members-being-converted-into-congress-agents-6158,"Rajnath Singh hints at ""Friendship Jihad"", BJP members being converted into Congress agents",,1409223005.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After failing to disassociate itself with the then-dead-now-alive RTI activist turned AAP member Chandra Mohan Sharma, AAP now claims that his coming back to life is a proof enough that god is with AAP and its members.

Rubbishing the reports that Chandra Mohan faked his death, party chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a ‘divine intervention that the RTI activist was among us today’.

“Bhaiyon uparwala hamaare saath hai”

“It is a miracle. Tell me one person who survived after being burnt to death. This proves that god/allah/bhagwan/waheguru is with us, and I appeal to Delhi voters to respect god and his wishes by voting for us whenever the elections happen,” Kejriwal argued as he warned Delhiites to ignore God’s wishes at their own peril.

Kejriwal showed Faking News this picture to show how Chandra Mohan Sharma was an active member of AAP, and how AAP’s candle march helped him being brought back to life.

When asked why did they earlier try to distance themselves from Sharma and claim he was not party’s member, Kejriwal shot back, “This is fact proves that we are not publicity hungry people. We just wanted logic to take its own course and did not in any way want undue media attention. But my conscience did not allow me to keep my fellow compatriots in dark for too long. Hence I decided to tell them the truth.”

Kejriwal further did not see anything wrong in Sharma being spotted in Nepal.

“What’s wrong in that? On the contrary we are glad that not just in India, but our selfless and dedicate members are now fighting for Swaraj and spreading core values of the party in other countries as well,” Kejriwal told our reporter.

This reporter later asked party leader Ashutosh for his comments on Chandra Mohan Sharma cheating death.

“Why are you using the term ‘cheating’? Are you Mudi agent?” Ashutosh retorted.

“Arvind Kejariwal is beautiful like Taj Mahal, and Chandra Mohan has Moon in his name. Taj Mahal needs Moon for its beauty. Ignore Mohan as India is a secular country. And RSS should be banned,” he concluded.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/arvind-kejriwal-press-meet-delhi-360.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-claims-coming-back-to-life-of-chandra-mohan-sharma-a-proof-that-god-is-with-aap-6156,AAP claims coming back to life of Chandra Mohan Sharma a proof that God is with AAP,,1409220326.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With RJD-JDU-Congress alliance in driving seat in Bihar by-polls, Congress is reportedly is in talks with its alliance partners to give partial credit for the victory to party Vice President Rahul Gandhi.

Congress, which won one of the six seats won by the alliance, is trying its best to convince Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar that it was Rahul Gandhi’s charisma that helped to pull off this remarkable comeback post the Lok Sabha debacle.

“kaa kehte ho, de dein credit? Long run mein fayada rahega“

“Whether they believe it or not, but it all happened because of Rahul Gandhi. Although he wasn’t physically present here during the campaign, it was his aura which helped the alliance to defeat BJP,” claimed Anil Mishra, a local Congress leader.

“Congress was the lucky charm in this grand secular alliance, and Rahul Ji is the lucky charm of Congress,” Mishra further claimed.

As winning elections has not been that regular phenomenon with Congress in the last few years, party doesn’t want to miss this opportunity to restore back grassroot workers’ faith in top leadership.

“Finally, Rahul Ji’s magic is working. I always knew he was capable to perform and somewhere deep down even Lalu Ji knows this fact. In his earlier comments during Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Yadav had already expressed his feelings for Rahul Ji,” Digvijay Singh told to Faking News, “All he need to do is to reiterate that once again.”

If party insiders are the be believed, in order to persuade Lalu-Nitish to credit Rahul Gandhi for the win, Congress has also played the minority card.

“Going by the MLA count within the alliance, Congress is certainly in minority. And considering nature of Lalu and Nitish, Congress top leadership is very hopeful that they will give Congress the credit it deserves,” disclosed a close aide of Bihar Congress chief, “It’s time for Lalu-Nitish to walk the talk, they should show the world how much they care for minority.”

Meanwhile, Bihar Congress has already placed hoardings thanking Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi , Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra for the alliance victory in different parts of the state capital.

“Well, Rahul Gandhi surely deserves credit,” a BJP leader said, “For keeping away from Bihar and not campaigning. Else we might have won more seats.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lalu-Nitish.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-in-talks-with-rjd-jdu-to-give-some-credit-to-rahul-gandhi-for-performance-in-bihar-by-polls-6130,Congress in talks with RJD-JDU to give some credit to Rahul Gandhi for performance in Bihar by-polls,,1408962762.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After having contributed massive amount of money through forfeiture of deposit in elections so far, AAP has now filed an RTI to know how and where is the money being used by the Election Commission.

Soon after AAP’s candidate lost his deposit in the just concluded Patiala by-elections, it struck their Stats Specialist Yogendra Yadav, that the party must have contributed of lot through this fashion by now.

He immediately did a quick internal survey and found that AAP as a party has made tremendous contribution to the exchequer by not just losing elections but losing them badly enough.

Arvind showing an estimate of the total amount AAP may have forfeited in deposits by now.

“We have contributed so much in the form of deposit forfeiture in both Lok Sabha and by-polls, that we want to know if that money is being used for welfare of people; if any subsidies are being given through that money or not,” Yogendra Yadav explained the reason behind filing an RTI.

“We have solid evidence that suggests that our money is being consumed by corrupt bureaucrats and politicians of BJP,” Yadav went on to claim.

Yadav however argued that losing deposit was a positive sign and showed how patriotic AAP as a party was.

“Shame on other political parties, specifically the BJP, who have probably made the lowest contribution towards losing deposits,” senior leader Ashutosh pointed out, “This once again proves that Modi is a heartless autocrat who doesn’t care for poor people.”

“We promise to work hard and continue serving more aam aadmis through this manner, even if it requires losing more elections,” Ashutosh further announced, amidst loud cheers from volunteers and supporters gathered at Jantar Mantar and Twitter.

Ashutosh further claimed that such forfeiture of deposits by AAP has led to increase in GDP of the country and hence it was AAP that was bringing the acche din promised by BJP.

When pointed out by our reporter that he was being theoretically incorrect and GDP doesn’t grow like that, he labelled him a paid agent of Modi.

After taking ALS Ice Bucket Challenge earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi challenged his political opponents Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, and senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani to take the chilling bath.

While Rahul and Advani are yet to respond, Aam Aadmi Party has declared the challenge as a political conspiracy to bring back party supremo’s chronic cough problem, which he got rid off recently after a marathon effort.

“It shows how cruel a person Mudi is!!” said a furious Ashutosh making scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “He was well aware of Arvind’s condition, and despite that he did this. It reflects his ill intentions. Daring Kejriwal to take this challenge is like challenging to paint Taj Mahal with black paint!”

Ashutosh further alleged that Modi wanted to wipe out all his opponents.

“By choosing ice, he has proved that he is doing cold blooded murder,” Ashutosh claimed, after which everyone started replying to him on Twitter.

However, in spite of fellow party members’ concerns, Arvind Kejriwal is unperturbed by the possible outcome of accepting the challenge, and has announced to take the dare at Ramlila Maidan on Saturday afternoon.

“I am not going to back off, nahi toh bhaiyon yeh mujhe phir bhagoda bolenege,” the AAP supremo announced, “No matter what happens to me, I will do it for my country, for Swaraj, and also for raising awareness about corruption.”

“I have already sacrificed a lot for India, and compare to all those this Ice Bucket Challenge is nothing. Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge, ai watan tere liye,” Kejriwal said, sending his supporters in frenzy.

Sources tell Faking News that AAP is planning to use this opportunity for to convert the Ice Bucket Challenge in India as another hashtag for the party, apart from attracting media attention.

“On Saturday at Ramlila Maidan, not only Kejriwal, but hundreds of AAP supporter will also be taking up the challenge to show solidarity with their leader,” disclosed a source close to party inner circle, “This time they don’t want Kejriwal to cough alone, they are ready to feel the same pain.”

Buoyed by the success of getting the “Namaste” gesture and “Vande Mataram” dropped from the Independence Day celebrations at a school in Kerala, another secular group, tragically named, Association of Historically Oppressed & Liberal Entities (ASSHOLE) has taken the fight against the idolatry gesture to the tech world.

Controversial “Namaste” emoji

The ASSHOLEs are protesting against the Namaste emoji (pic on the right) on the popular messenger app WhatsApp.

Dozens of ASSHOLEs were seen demonstrating outside the office of Google, which owns the Android OS, on which WhatsApp has been a runaway success.

Speaking to the gathered reporters, ASSHOLE spokesperson Mihir Butt said, “Whenever we use emojis on WhatsApp we are forced to see the Namaste emoji. This is nothing but forcible imposition of Hindu culture on seculars and non-Hindus. We demand that Google suspend WhatsApp from the Play Store with immediate effect until the offending emoji has been taken down.”

Eminent thinker and popular troll-bait Kavita Krishnan also spoke to the media on this issue.

Standing in front of a now defunct BSNL Telegram Office, holding what appeared to be a message to Lenin, Ms Krishnan told the gathered reporters, “This is nothing but pure majoritarianism on the part of WhatsApp and Google. Such blatant communalization of Android has become increasingly noticeable since the appointment of an Internet Hindu, Sundar Pichai as the Head of Android in 2013. This is threatening the secular fabric of the Android platform. WhatsApp is to the PlayStore what ISIS is to Islam.”

She also added that she would be giving up her Android phone and switch to a Nokia 3310, drawing huge applause from everyone present.

“She has sacrificed so much for communal harmony,” a neutral journalist noted.

Former journalist and now part-time AAP spokesperson and full time comedian Ashuosh83B tweeted, “WhatsApp akon has traditionaali been Green and White. Any attempt of Saffronzation of WhatsApp shuld be strongly resisted, (sic)” and “AAP Executive Council has decided to boycott WhatAapp and switch to WeChat #PrayForWeChat.”

The new WhatsApp emoji

Google and WhatsApp have, so far, declined to speak to the press at the time of publication. However they wondered why the protests were not directed at Apple, because WhatsApp was available on iOS too.

“Maybe because these people have a habit of turning a blind eye to at least one party in every case,” a Google employee told Faking News.

A private school in south Kerala has dismissed 25 Hindu students after an unknown (rather we won’t divulge) religious outfit allegedly threatened its management, claiming that the names of the students were against the religious beliefs of a section of the community.

This comes close to the incident of another school in Kerala banning Vande Mataram and Namaste from its Independence Day celebrations, so that the religious sentiments of a community were not hurt.

Initially, PotB Centenary School in Pallam, 65 KMs south of Trivandrum, had around 400 Hindu students among its 1500 students. But, due to pressure from several secular and peaceful organizations, the strength came down to 25 in just 5 years. The school management, however, maintains that this was due to the poor performance of Hindu kids and has nothing to do with their names.

What a communal bunch of kids?

Earlier today, those remaining 25 students too were asked to leave the school. The management again declined that it was due to their religion.

But leader of one of the peaceful organizations, which had asked the school to dismiss the students, was far more candid.

“Imagine our kids calling the names of those Hindu students. It will be like, our kids are reciting the verses of idolaters. This is against our religious beliefs,” the leader claimed.

“Many enraged parents had earlier came to us reporting how their kids kept on chanting unholy names while taking on phone and while playing with those Hindu children. We requested the management to remove these students else we might have to indulge in violence. Our peaceful appeal was accepted,” he added.

When asked about a few names that allegedly offended the religious beliefs, he first sought permission from his God and then laid out a long list, which had few names like “Abishek, Abinav, Balram, Bharath, Deepak, Jagannath, Ram, Krishna, Aarti, Suchitra, etc.”

When contacted, the school management denied any external pressure.

“Those 25 kids failed in maths. They cannot even tell two plus two equals four. So, we had to remove them from our school as they were unable to satisfy our intelligence criteria. It has nothing to do with external pressure,” an administrator of the school said.

Meanwhile many secular organizations have wondered why Hindu parents were naming their kids in a way that was offensive to fellow Indians.

“There are millions of names they could have chosen from. Why are they picking up these names only? It is like forcing kids from other religion to recite religious names. Hindus should learn tolerance and inclusiveness,” a secular person told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chandigarh-kids_1706561i.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kerala-school-expels-hindu-students-as-calling-their-names-offends-religious-sentiments-6071,"Kerala school expels Hindu students, as calling their names offends religious sentiments",,1408189231.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The party plans to open a “U-turn University” in the city with the aim to produce world class u-turners, who will shine in areas like politics, economics, driving, and other facets of life.

AAP chief teaching young students nuances of a steep u-turn.

“We fear that after legendary Kejriwal ji decides to call it a day, we wouldn’t be left with any talented u-turner to fill up the void and his big shoes chappals,” an AAP member explained how the move will help AAP, and thus the humanity.

While AAP supremo Kejriwal would obviously oversee the progress, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh, the original u-turn enthusiast, has been roped in in the capacity of a consultant.

“When Wasim Akram can give tips to Indian fast bowlers, why can’t Netaji break political barriers for a good cause?” an AAP member shot back when asked if the invitation to Netaji meant SP and AAP were bhai bhai.

The curriculum will include u-turn programs in choc-a-bloc Chandani Cowk roads, where students will be asked to make u-turns in peak hours.

AAP members are of the opinion that not only in politics, such u-turns will be of great use even in personal and professional lives of a person.

“You can resign from your job in the morning, go home and relax, and then come back in the evening and claim you never resigned!” an enthusiastic AAP member explained the benefits to lure candidates.

“You can even strengthen your personal relationships at home by telling your wife you never had any girlfriend before her,” he explained how u-turns can bring greatest of the turns in one’s life.

After Rahul Gandhi accused Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan of being biased towards BJP for not allowing him to speak inside the Parliament, many Congress leaders are afraid that Lok Sabha speaker may allow Rahul to speak.

Being Congress MPs, they are not openly expressing their views against their lord Vice President, but a couple of them did accept on the condition of anonymity.

Sources say that despite running along with Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha well today protesting that Congress was not allowed to speak, party MPs were afraid of the consequences.

This is what most Congress MPs want.

“Last time when Rahul Ji tried to speak, our MPs count reduced from 206 to 44. That’s why we don’t want to take such a risk again. Who knows, our strength could further get reduced to 24,” Ramkhilawan Singh (imaginary name of a Congress MP) told Faking News.

Ramkhilawan Singh claims that he and other MPs pray to god daily that Rahul Gandhi falls asleep in the Parliament so that things don’t get worse for the party.

“His habit of sleeping during Lok Sabha proceedings is a huge respite for us. Even though the party faced a lot of ridicule when visuals of him sleeping were broadcast on TV, believe me, it’s a blessing in disguise,” the MP said, claiming that the benefits derived from a sleeping Rahul Gandhi were far more than any of those derived from a speaking Rahul Gandhi.

Ramkhilawan’s confession has led to rumors that some Congress MPs have been adding sedative to Rahul Gandhi’s breakfast.

“You know why opposition was outraging when Rahul Gandhi was caught sleeping? Because they wanted him to speak; obviously for their own benefits,” another Congress MP claimed.

The decision to induct these failed candidates was taken after the union government made it clear that it would not scrap CSAT this year and there will not by any further changes to the exam pattern.

Yogendra spotting fresh talent for his party.

Justifying the decision, Yogendra Yadav called these protesters budding aam anarchists of the country, talent and efforts of whom he felt needed recognition. “There is a ‘rant’ in aspirant,” Mr. Yadav pointed out the inherent requirement.

It gave me a sense of déjà vu and reminded me of the demands we would make every now then, even when we were in power,” a senior leader of AAP told Faking News, “They have already proved their mettle and deserve a shot at highest level, which we are committed to provide them.”

When pointed that the protests by UPSC aspirants did not result into their demands being met, he shot back, “So when have our protests resulted into anything concrete?”

AAP insisted that it was a win-win situation for both the party and the aspirants.

After Exit Polls predicted a comfortable to sweeping victory for the NDA coalition, the BJP is not ready to accept a different public mandate on the counting day. Senior leaders of BJP have decided to form a government in the virtual world if the results in the real world are contrary to the predictions.

“We are not going to take a ‘no’ for an answer now come what may,” Amit Shah told Faking News, “If for some Subramanian Swamy certified reasons, BJP doesn’t emerge victorious, it will only mean that we have been denied our rights, and hence we will make up for it in the virtual world.”

Modi impressed with his million fans on Internet.

“EVMs being rigged or partial counting by the Election Commission,” Shah clarified what he meant by “Subramanian Swamy certified reasons”.

“Plus there could be so many people who would have been extremely tired after relentlessly voting for Modi in the online opinion polls that on the actual voting day, they may have taken a break and decided against casting their vote,” BJP Uttar Pradesh’s strategist went on to explain possible reasons of BJP defeat.

Sources tell Faking News that BJP, whose planning about cabinet even before results are out can be compared with a person hiring a driver even before buying a car, has even finalized some of the positions in the virtual cabinet on Twitter.

Riding on the huge Social Media wave, Narendra Modi will undoubtedly be the Prime Minister of BJP’s virtual government.

Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga will be the Defense Minister. His role will to defend blunders of BJP and counter it with allegations about other parties.

Internet Hindus could be the Virtual Army with one of the HDL handles on Twitter as Chief of Army Staff.

There is still confusion as to who between Madhu Kishwar and Subramanian Swamy will hold the Ministry of Conspiracy Theories, since both have proved their mettle by coming up with theories that can be matched only by those woven by liberal minds.

Apart from the cabinet formation, BJP will hold sessions on Twitter and Facebook instead of holding any discussion in the Parliament. BJP argues that in any case, debates on Twitter are already way ahead of Parliament debates when it comes to nastiness, so adjustment wouldn’t be much of a problem.

Meanwhile AAP, which was initially threatening to sit on a Dharna if the real results were contrary to their expectations, has demanded that if BJP formed the government virtually, they should at least be the principal opposition party since Congress is virtually non-existent on Social Media.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Modi-Laptop.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-to-form-online-government-if-bjp-doesnt-come-to-power-5369,Modi to form online government if BJP doesn't come to power,,1400147142.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-appointing-new-army-chief-outgoing-upa-appoints-rahul-gandhi-as-prime-minister-5365,"News Delhi. Continuing the decision making spree, incumbent UPA government took another bold measure and appointed Rahul Gandhi as the new Prime Minister of India.

It all happened last night at the farewell party organized for the outgoing PM Manmohan Singh, who himself requested the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to anoint the Nehru-Gandhi scion as the Prime Minister of India.

Humble man.

As per party insiders, it started when Sonia Gandhi asked Dr. Manmohan Singh if he had any wish that he wanted the party to fulfill.

“Manmohan Ji expressed his desire to see Rahul Gandhi on the top post and work under him. It was his farewell gift to Rahul Ji on his own farewell,” revealed an insider.

Other leaders present at the venue supported Manmohan’s wish and within an hour, final decision was made. A grand coronation ceremony was organized immediately, where in the presence of Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India, Rahul Gandhi took oath as the 14th Prime Minister of India.

“It was the best moment of my life,” a Congress leader claimed, and forwarded the same as an SMS to Sonia Gandhi.

However, Rahul Gandhi is reported to have resigned within an hour of being sown in as the Prime Minister of India.

While the reasons of Rahul Gandhi’s resignation is not known yet, Congressmen hailed his stint as one of the most productive tenure of a Prime Minister in the history of India.

“We noticed a sudden jump in country’s growth rate during those few minutes. Anything like this is unheard of,” claimed a well known writer, who insisted he was neutral and an economist.

“I think Rahul Gandhi is copying Arvind Kejriwal,” a political expert told Faking News, “In order to better Kejriwal’s record, who resigned after 49 days in power, he resigned after 49 minutes only.”

“Or maybe this was all done to stop Modi,” the expert added, “To stop Modi from entering the history books as the first Prime Minister of India who was born after Independence.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/RahulGOT.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-appointing-new-army-chief-outgoing-upa-appoints-rahul-gandhi-as-prime-minister-5365,"After appointing new Army Chief, outgoing UPA appoints Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister",,1400070229.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Congress party leaders, who officially had stated they won’t participate in Exit Polls debate, had in fact had a debate among themselves on the night news channels aired them. Sources tell Faking News that a secret meeting behind closed doors took place at 10 Janpath where some party leaders gathered to analyze and discuss the predicted results.

Sources further inform that the meeting started at a rather ugly note where a concerned Sonia Gandhi rebuked Rahul Gandhi for refusing to change the channel and insisting on watching old episodes of Chhota Bheem.

Scenes from the meeting.

A reluctant Rahul Gandhi handed over the remote to his mother and started sobbing. This is what happened thereafter:

Rajiv Shukla: Please don’t cry Rahul Ji, nahi toh main bhi ro dunga.

Sanjay Jha: Nahi. Main rounga Rahul ji ke saath.

Salman Khurshid: NO. I am senior. I will cry.

Kapil Sibal: Within minutes without having to try, we all are going to cry. (pauses) Wow, that rhymed!

Meanwhile Sonia Gandhi was looking at the remote, apparently thinking of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was not invited to this special meeting. She was jolted out of her thoughts by Sibal’s poetry, and she finally changed the channel.

Times Now is where she landed first. Seeing Arnab on screen, Rahul Gandhi started crying even more loudly and walked out of the room. All leaders get up and try to follow Rahul.

Sonia Gandhi: It’s alright. He will be fine. Let’s see what these guys are saying.

(Everyone starts watching the TV, where Rajasthan figures are flashed on screen)

Sonia Gandhi: (almost choking on her coffee) Holi Ravioli! 14 seats for us and just 10 for BJP. Is it for real???

Ashok Gehlot: Told ya. There is a Gehlot wave in Turkey err..I mean Rajasthan. Assembly elections were just an aberration you see.

Sanjay Jha: On the contrary its because of all the bashing that I have taken in Newshour debates that Arnab has been little generous in Rajasthan.

Digvijay Singh: Exit polls also reflect EVM tamperings?

Rajiv Shukla: I think it was because of Rahul Gandhi’s leadership.

Sonia Gandhi smiles.

Everyone smiles.

Just as the UPA touches three figure mark, all leaders start jumping, giving high-fives to one another, and distributing sweets.

Rajiv Shukla: We have done it. This calls for celebration Sonia ji. It is all because of Indira ji’s vision, Rajiv Ji’s dream, Rahul ji’s guidance and Priyanka ji’s wave in the country.

Sonia Gandhi: Let’s hold on for a minute. (changes channels and lands on News24, run by Rajiv Shukla’s company. News24 predicts massive win for NDA and UPA restricted to 70 seats)

Everyone looks towards Rajiv Shukla.

Kapil Sibal: Why even 70 seats Shukla ji, why not Zero?

Rajiv Shukla: Arey, you forgot? In Gujarat assembly elections, you had claimed that BJP lost because they got lesser seats than expected. This will build expectations and then we can say BJP lost and there is no Modi wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Shabash Shukla Ji. Never thought you could be this intelligent.

Rajiv Shukla: All because of Rahul ji’s leadership.

(At this point they switch over to NDTV, which was showing some program on farming instead of discussing anything political.)

Sonia Gandhi: Ah! That’s why NDTV is my favorite. Always the best channel to watch.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-appoints-new-chief-cook-gardener-and-driver-at-pms-official-residence-5352,"New Delhi. In a controversial move, the outgoing UPA Government appointed Sarson Singh as the Chief Cook at 7 Race Course Road, the official residence of the Prime Minister. The posts of Chief Gardener and Chief Driver were also filled in a hurriedly called cabinet meeting last night.

While Congress is calling it “routine appointments”, leading legal light Ram Jethmalani claimed that that this last-minute appointments of tri-service chiefs smacked of constitutional impropriety.

Sarson Singh

Congress spokesman Manish Tiwari was quick to come to his party’s defense. “The appointment might be hasty, but Sarson ka Saag is tasty!” he insisted, smacking his lips.

BJP was understandably livid, “The incumbent’s retirement isn’t coming up until July 25th. What was the hurry to cook the curry? As per seniority, Khamand Dholakia was supposed to become the next Chief Cook. Are they trying to manipulate the line of succession?”

The controversy re-kindled memories of last year’s expiration date fiasco. The then cook, Doodh Daruwalla had made Ras Malai with Aavin milk that had an expiration date 1 year in the future. However, when the cow was questioned, she revealed that her calf’s date of birth was entered incorrectly in its SSLC certificate. Since the milk production date coincided with the calf’s birth, the PMO suspected that the milk had already gone bad.

The case went to the courts. Expert witness Lalu Yadav testified that fodder quality was paramount to milk’s longevity. The Supreme Court finally asked Daruwalla to sway with the wind and prepare a fresh batch of Ras Malai. The entire dish episode left a sour taste in the mouth.

The relationship between the cook and the PMO had been strained since then. When the Tamilian cow owner Kada Kumar had brought over his fully decorated cows to see Daruwalla on the occasion of Mattu Pongal, 10 Janpath panicked, sensing a coup.

Shekhar Gupta wrote a scathing piece, lambasting Coup-Mata and recommending that the PMO be informed of all future bovine movements, including those of the bowel.

Coming back to the present, the BJP is in no mood to let these appointments go unchallenged.

BJP Spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, “Congress has corrupted every household institution. The gardener is a plant; the maid sweeps everything under the carpet; the cook knows which side of the bread is buttered & the driver is unaware of the bumpy road ahead. The only thing we can get rid of is the 10 year old doormat!”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Halwai.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-appoints-new-chief-cook-gardener-and-driver-at-pms-official-residence-5352,"UPA appoints new Chief Cook, Gardener, and Driver at PM's official residence",,1400051969.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Buoyed with the exit polls prediction that UPA is likely to touch 100 figure mark in Lok Sabha elections, Congress party leaders have unanimously accepted Rahul Gandhi’s huge contribution in achieving the feat and thanked him for helping them out in such an anti-Congress environment.

“I never imagined that a 43-year-young kid could steer us through such a ferocious battle. He is miraculous, and a child prodigy,” said Congress senior leader Salman Khurshid showering praise on Nehru-Gandhi scion.

The power of one.

Mr. Khurshid went on comparing Rahul’s war against so-called communal forces to that of Abhimanyu’s battle in Mahabharat.

“Just like Abhimanyu, I guess Rahul Ji learnt the art of political combat while he was in his mother’s womb, otherwise, there is no way to explain such sharp political acumen at such an early stage of life,” Salman Khurshid thanked Mother India.

There is a section within the Congress party which believes that without being a part of the government, Rahul Gandhi has done what was actually expected from Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh.

“Unfortunately there were a few scams that Manmohan Singh couldn’t stop,” said a prominent party leader making a scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “But thanks to Rahul Ji who single handedly helped us to touch 100 mark, or else we could have reduced to around 10 seats.”

None of the Congress Lok Sabha candidates, who are hopeful of winning, are ready to give themselves even a small fraction of credit. Gyanraj Sharma, a Congress candidate with strong chance of winning from Punjab, reportedly, beat up one of his supporter for publicly giving credit to him.

When we asked Rahul Gandhi, that why were Congressmen so happy even after a prediction of just 100 seats, he said, “Because they are wise people and understand that poverty in terms of Lok Sabha seat is just a state of mind.”

Meanwhile to celebrate the accomplishment, Congress party organized a success bash at party office in Delhi last night, where many leaders including Digvijay Singh were spotted teary eyed.

However, on being enquired, Mr Singh clarified, “These are tears of joy.” He also declared that under the guidance and leadership of youth leader Rahul Gandhi, Congress will rise to power in 2019.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PowerfulRahul.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-thanks-rahul-gandhi-for-helping-upa-touch-100-figure-in-exit-polls-5340,Congress thanks Rahul Gandhi for helping UPA touch 100 figure in Exit Polls,,1399980594.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Exit Polls predicted a certain NDA government at center, BJP has gone into the mode of government formation and taking decisions and post poll planning. Today in a press conference, party president Rajnath Singh said that Narendra Modi will not do any injustice to either Varanasi or Vadodara and will continue as a Member of Parliament for both the constituencies.

He claimed that it was possible to do so with some amendments in the constitution as he was confident that the BJP will form the government with a sweeping majority, which will give it the powers to change the constitution like Indira and Rajiv did.

Har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi.

“Just like technology has been adopted by cricket, our parliament should also adopt it. It shouldn’t be made compulsory for a person to resign from one seat if he wins from two,” Mr. Singh explained.

Rajnath Singh quickly left the press conference as he had to attend meetings to finalize cabinet. Later this Faking News reporter reached out to a party member who disclosed the modus operandi on conditions of anonymity and some donations to his private fund.

He started with the statement, “Itni chhoti baat aap ko samajh nahi aayi yaar, Abki baar modi sarkar!” Later he explained that BJP will be using the same 3D holographic technology which we used for the poll campaign. This way, Narendra Modi can be at two places at a time and thus can represent the two parliamentary seats simultaneously.

Party sources say that the technology has been designed in such a way that the virtual 3D Narendra Modi will be able to debate with the original Narendra Modi, so that the viewers are totally convinced about the dual role he promised to play.

Going further, the BJP is planning to use the same technique to let Narendra Modi continue as the Chief Minister of Gujarat as well as the Prime Minister of India. Constitutional amendments will make it all legal.

The party workers, who aware of this technology, were enthusiastic and one of them was of the opinion that constitution should be further amended to allow Narendra Modi to contest from all the 543 constituencies in the next Lok Sabh elections.

“Even if someone is disqualified for showing poll symbol, or another is denied visa by US, we can always have the original Narendra Modi safe!” said an exited BJP worker.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ModiHologram.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-to-be-mp-from-both-varanasi-and-vadodara-seats-using-3d-holographic-technology-5338,Modi to be MP from both Varanasi and Vadodara seats using 3D holographic technology,,1399969350.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-inspecting-evm-in-amethi-rahul-gandhi-to-star-in-the-repairman-5334,"Mumbai. Rahul Gandhi is all set to become a Bollywood superstar. His first movie ‘The Repairman’ is set to be released this Friday. Following is a special preview of the movie:

Directed by the Election Commission of India, the movie is about a man in his 40s going around repairing all of the machines, which he has no idea of. Like their previous films, this one was targeted by the Directors to appease the Gandhis, the leading Bollywood family.

Raul, a failed Harvard/Rollins dropout passout who lives by repairing his political party (thereby damaging it more), repairs a damaged Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) on a polling day in a small booth in the town Amethi of Uttar Pradesh.

When asked to explain the circumstances that led to his Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) repairing fiasco, he rewinds a little too far… launching into a story as long as a film about his life over the past year.

Rahul Gandhi in and as Repairman

Enter Narendra Modi and his bunch of friends, who are always so ready to criticize him; the PM uncle who’s silently encouraging him to sort his life out; and the reassuring presence of Bianca, a young farmer’s wife who’s moved to Amethi and seems to be the only person who understands him. For a while, at least.

The director, Election Commission, has tried to tell a inspiring story of how a person who does not know anything about repair, trying his hands out in repairing complex machines. But the movie fails in the logical aspect like the ‘hero Raul trying to repair the EVM by telling that he will empower it again and again and again’.

The strong emotional pull of the movie is however revealed in the scenes where Raul’s brother-in-law Varda who is a poor Indian farmer trying to live with his small farming land. His plight is laughed off by the villain, BJP members, upon whom the anger of audience is entirely invisible.

The villains in the flashback are ruthless, with the antagonist Modi (whose screen presence is sure of scaring the “intellectual” audience) going after the poor hero by snatching his toffee from him outside the candy shop which moves us emotionally. Also, there is this scene of interaction with another sadist villain Arnab Goswami, who shames the hero by unnecessary questions.

But the pillars of movie are Raul’s friends – Sanjay Jha, Digvijay Singh and Arvind Kejriwal. Sanjay Jha goes after people who mock Raul and there is a sweet romantic portion for Digvijay Singh. We can see the future of Indian drama and cinema in Arvind Kejriwal, whose acting skills are going to make directors queue outside his home.

Our verdict for this movie is less than 100 out of 540, while reviews from Rigged newspaper (ran by the Director of this movie) might make it 500 out of 540. And the bottomline of the movie is, “If Raul can repair something, you can very well do it, so stop saying that ‘you don’t know’ next time your parents ask you to repair that equipment in your home.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/REPAIRMAN.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-inspecting-evm-in-amethi-rahul-gandhi-to-star-in-the-repairman-5334,"After inspecting EVM in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi to star in ""The Repairman""",,1399900786.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after flaunting his party symbol at poll booth, Ajay Rai, the Congress candidate from Varanasi, has requested Election Commission to immediately send him to jail.

At the same time, Congress has asked BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to follow Ajay Rai’s footsteps and get himself arrested in a similar case which is pending against him.

“I have committed a crime, hit me on my head with the mike which you are holding.”

Reportedly, Ajay Rai realized that he was committing such a heinous crime only after one of his close associate Gyani Shukla, who was standing ahead of him in the voting queue pointed at the Congress badge on his Kurta.

“The moment he saw the badge with party symbol, he removed it and threw it away, as if it was a bomb. He was yelling, ‘mujhse paap ho gaya, ab to prayashcit karna hi padega‘,” revealed Gyani, narrating the incident which happened at the booth.

“Ajay babu ran toward Ganga river and jumped into it to wash the sin which he committed by violating model code of conduct. Modi didn’t even go for Ganga aarti!” Gyani added.

Even after coming to know that an FIR has been lodged against him, Ajay Rai didn’t cool down. As per Mr Rai’s family members, he even whipped himself 100 times for his act.

Later, unable to get guilt out of his mind, Ajay Rai finally reached local police station to get arrested.

Sources say that an ugly spat took place between Mr Rai supporters and policemen. “Ajay Rai forcibly tried to get himself inside holding cell by breaking the lock. First time in my life, I saw someone breaking lock-up to get inside,” disclosed a source.

However, after policemen offered to arrest Ajay Rai in one of the 9 pending criminal cases against him, he ran away from the police station.

Meanwhile Ajay Rai’s own party Congress has given Election Commission the full freedom to take all possible measures to punish Ajay Rai and Narendra Modi.

“No disciplinary action is enough for the crime which Mr Rai has committed,” said Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari reacting to the situation. “But look at the modesty with which he is ready to accept any punishment. Mr. Modi don’t have guts to do that. He should take some inspiration from his rival in Varanasi and get himself arrested!”

Meanwhile, impressed with Ajay Rai’s love for the law, Congress has offered him PM post in UPA 3, which he refused.

“For god sake, there is a charge of flaunting party symbol near poll booth against me. Such a heinous crime! I have no right to become Prime Minister of this country,” said Mr. Rai.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AjayRai.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ajay-rai-wants-to-go-to-jail-for-flaunting-party-symbol-congress-says-good-send-modi-too-5332,"Ajay Rai wants to go to jail for flaunting party symbol; Congress says, ""Good, send Modi too""",,1399900131.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a joint meeting held by the representatives of all leading news channels last evening, it was unanimously decided to give at least 150 seats to AAP in every exit poll that will be telecast today after 6:30 pm.

The channels took this decision to avoid Aroon Purie like situation, where Kejriwal accused him selling his soul to Narendra Modi and called his opinion poll on Varanasi, farzi.

“We’ll have to fix these polls in favor of AAP to avoid the polls being called fixed by their leadership,” a journalist revealed their strategy.

AAP supporters insisted that the right spelling of “anya” was “aap” and news channel was not disclosing the truth.

“150 seats have been set aside for AAP. The real exit polls will be for remaining 393 seats only. Whatever data we have for 543 seats, we will interpolate it for these 393 seats,” he further confirmed how it will work.

“Things have been very good between me and Arvind so far, he hasn’t called me a paid Modi agent even once, and I don’t want to spoil my relations with him by doing an honest exit poll!” a krantikaari journalist told Faking News.

While majority of the channels have reserved 150 seats for AAP, a few other are even willing to directly ask Kejriwal how many seats he thinks AAP will win, so that there is no scope of corruption and farziness left in their predictions.

“You never know he may want AAP to get a complete majority, and here we are showing only 150 seats,” a psephologist from an exit poll agency explained, “So we may even take help of Yogendra Yadav’s internal surveys if need be.”

Meanwhile Kejriwal has already lashed out at Exit Polls on Twitter, hinting they should probably be done after results are out.

“72 hours before results, News Channels are going to show exit polls. Why? What r ur intentions paid jounos?” read his tweet.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-drew-crowds-by-faking-rahuls-roadshow-as-his-baraat-with-free-food-bjp-5309,"Varanasi. Making sensational claims about the presence of huge crowd in Rahul Gandhi’s roadshow earlier today, BJP has alleged that Congress had gathered people by falsely claiming that it was Rahul Gandhi’s baraat (wedding procession) and baratis will get free food.

“Congress has used this strategy in many of Rahul’s earlier roadshows too, there is nothing new in it. And why do you think Rahul is still unmarried? Just to repeat this drama again and again for political benefits,” claimed BJP’s chief conspiracy theorist Subramanian Swamy.

Baraat, in BJP’s eyes.

Mr. Swamy cited the presence of shehnai music and vedic matras being played in the roadshow as clinching evidences of his theory that the roadshow was falsely marketed as Rahul Gandhi’s wedding procession.

“This was to make people believe that it was indeed Rahul’s baraat. Otherwise, who plays shehnai in a political roadshow?” argued Swamy, “And above that, we have also spotted a band playing Bollywood tracks in the roadshow. What more proof do we need?”

“Buddhu has finally made others buddhu!” he concluded in his trademark style.

Unable to explain the presence of crowds in Rahul Gandhi’s roadshow, the BJP has decided to go with Swamy’s theory. The party later released pics of people dancing and carrying garlands in their hands, proving that people mistook the roadshow as baraat.

“It is a common sight in every Indian baraat; baraatis do carry garlands to put them around necks of bride-side people. It proves that many in the roadshow were thinking that they were part of Rahul’s baraat,” Janaardhan Mishra, a member of BJP’s local unit demanded that Election Commission should add the baraat budget in Congress election expenses.

However, Congress party has flatly rejected BJP’s assertions and called it a conspiracy theory fabricated to conceal the nervousness of the saffron party.

“If it was a baraat, why were there no stickers reading ‘Rahul Weds XYZ’ on the vehicles that were part of the procession? People are not that fool as we think!” reacted Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who claimed that there was huge Rahul Gandhi wave and today’s roadshow proved that UPA will return to power in a week.

But BJP is sticking to its conspiracy theory. In response to Khurshid’s poser, BJP’s Ravishankar Prasad told Faking News that most of the baraatis never care about stickers or who is getting married to whom, because all they care about is free food and naagin dance.

When we tried to get Rahul Gandhi’s response on BJP’s claims, he refused to make any comment, but sources say that he blushed.

But the most convincing counter to BJP’s conspiracy theory came from Congress’ own conspiracy theorist Digvijay Singh, who initially refused to talk to us when he heard about wedding and baraat. When we said that it was not a personal question, he agreed to speak to us.

“In UP and Bihar, baaraat is taken out in the evening, not in the morning or in the afternoon,” he pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rahul-roadshow.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-drew-crowds-by-faking-rahuls-roadshow-as-his-baraat-with-free-food-bjp-5309,"Congress drew crowds by faking Rahul’s roadshow as his baraat, with free food: BJP",,1399715133.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray has finally spotted an opportunity to go beyond Maharashtra. With huge number of outsiders rushing into Varanasi due to elections, Raj Thackeray has decided to help locals against this influx of outsiders.

“Entire Varanasi has been turned into a mess by people coming in from other districts of UP and from other states,” thundered the MNS chief, showing rare compassion for North Indians.

A typical day on roads of Varanasi.

“They are eating all the paans available in the city, and because of that local people are suffering from malnutrition. I met a resident of Godowlia area; he hasn’t been able to get a single paan in the last 15 days!” Raj Thackeray disclosed the grave ground reality.

“Locals are not even able to take a dip in Ganga, as Ganga is filled with outsiders. Every day, one or the other leader and their supporters are doing drama on the river bank,” Raj added further, “Now I am here, and I will not let others devoid Banarasi Manoos of their rights!”

Varanasi unit of MNS, which has been named “Banaras Navnirman Sena (BNS)”, is acting in full swing and getting a lot of support from residents of the city.

BNS says that the local people are facing trouble in commuting across the city because of the regular roadshows conducted by outsiders and due to thousands of journalists in the city from hundreds of news channels asking them random questions.

“We are going to hire a few helicopters to carry locals from their homes to offices, schools and colleges,” a volunteer of BNS declared the grand plans of the newly formed Thackeray party.

However, he quickly added that his party will not be shying away from resorting to extreme measures, for which they are well known and widely respected.

A volunteer of BNS revealed to Faking News that they were running a silent campaign against the outsiders by mixing jamalgota (a laxative) in paans being sold at paan bhandaars. “Bahut Banarasi paan khaane ka shaukh hai unko, let them eat and shit,” he quipped with an evil smirk on his face.

Few of the other tricks being used by BNS is offering outsiders lassi with overdose of bhaang. Reportedly, few days back, they put a couple of outsiders high on bhaang in a boat in Ganga, and set them off sailing, after convincing them that the boat would take them to Switzerland.

Besides these, some reports of outsiders being thrown directly into the Ganga by BNS volunteers is also there.

Meanwhile, a group of AAP supporters claimed that they were slapped by BJP supporters. But soon after the news went public, Raj Thackeray’s party rejected their claims and took the responsibility of the act.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CrowdIndia.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/with-so-many-outsiders-in-varanasi-raj-thackeray-comes-out-in-support-of-locals-5307,"With so many outsiders in Varanasi, Raj Thackeray comes out in support of locals",,1399633397.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“It needs a large heart to do such things”

“I fail to understand how you could not provide a comfortable life for your buffaloes who spent their entire life bull shitting for you and trying to ensure a brighter future for you. Your buffaloes are like my fellow Congressmen. I have immense respect for them. I may not be as resourceful as you are, but I would request you to allow me to provide them all the necessary comforts of life according to my capacity,” Rashid Alvi said in a letter to Azam Khan.

Alvi lamented that Azam Khan has been telling in his campaign all along that his buffaloes saved him single-handedly in the most difficult conditions.

“You mentioned how they had to graze in the neighboring lawns to ensure that they could look after you properly. If you check their DNAs, you will be surprised to know that it is no different from that of Congressmen and Samajwadi Party men.”

“With their dedication and hard work, they brought you up in a way that you could not only rise to become a Minister in a state like UP, but also want on to become the PM candidate of your party,” he told Azam Khan. At the same time, he told Azam Khan that he was “deeply pained” when he came to know that the buffaloes of the UP Minister still live in an 8X8 shed.

“I was also distressed when I saw that they traveled on foot to escape from your house recently,” he said, noting that in Indian culture, when the Master does well in life, the first beneficiaries of the success are usually his buffaloes.

“Azam Khan ji, recently when you filed your nomination, you disclosed assets worth more than Rs 1.75 crores and a few criminal cases against you. I am baffled how even as an ordinary criminal, who has so much wealth, you fail to provide necessary comforts to your buffaloes!”

“We regularly see how you travel in private jets and cavalcades of many luxury cars. We also know of your love for study tours to Mont Blanc, Istanbul, Amsterdam, Dubai and other places. You travel in Business class while Congressmen like Shashi Tharoor travel in cattle class with other secular buffaloes,” he added.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Rashid-Alvi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-rashid-alvi-writes-to-azam-khan-offering-to-take-care-of-his-buffaloes-5301,Congress leader Rashid Alvi writes to Azam Khan offering to take care of his buffaloes,,1399549633.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Exit Polls predicted a comfortable to sweeping victory for the NDA coalition, the BJP is not ready to accept a different public mandate on the counting day. Senior leaders of BJP have decided to form a government in the virtual world if the results in the real world are contrary to the predictions.

“We are not going to take a ‘no’ for an answer now come what may,” Amit Shah told Faking News, “If for some Subramanian Swamy certified reasons, BJP doesn’t emerge victorious, it will only mean that we have been denied our rights, and hence we will make up for it in the virtual world.”

Modi impressed with his million fans on Internet.

“EVMs being rigged or partial counting by the Election Commission,” Shah clarified what he meant by “Subramanian Swamy certified reasons”.

“Plus there could be so many people who would have been extremely tired after relentlessly voting for Modi in the online opinion polls that on the actual voting day, they may have taken a break and decided against casting their vote,” BJP Uttar Pradesh’s strategist went on to explain possible reasons of BJP defeat.

Sources tell Faking News that BJP, whose planning about cabinet even before results are out can be compared with a person hiring a driver even before buying a car, has even finalized some of the positions in the virtual cabinet on Twitter.

Riding on the huge Social Media wave, Narendra Modi will undoubtedly be the Prime Minister of BJP’s virtual government.

Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga will be the Defense Minister. His role will to defend blunders of BJP and counter it with allegations about other parties.

Internet Hindus could be the Virtual Army with one of the HDL handles on Twitter as Chief of Army Staff.

There is still confusion as to who between Madhu Kishwar and Subramanian Swamy will hold the Ministry of Conspiracy Theories, since both have proved their mettle by coming up with theories that can be matched only by those woven by liberal minds.

Apart from the cabinet formation, BJP will hold sessions on Twitter and Facebook instead of holding any discussion in the Parliament. BJP argues that in any case, debates on Twitter are already way ahead of Parliament debates when it comes to nastiness, so adjustment wouldn’t be much of a problem.

Meanwhile AAP, which was initially threatening to sit on a Dharna if the real results were contrary to their expectations, has demanded that if BJP formed the government virtually, they should at least be the principal opposition party since Congress is virtually non-existent on Social Media.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Modi-Laptop.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-to-form-online-government-if-bjp-doesnt-come-to-power-5369,Modi to form online government if BJP doesn't come to power,,1400147142.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

It all happened last night at the farewell party organized for the outgoing PM Manmohan Singh, who himself requested the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to anoint the Nehru-Gandhi scion as the Prime Minister of India.

Humble man.

As per party insiders, it started when Sonia Gandhi asked Dr. Manmohan Singh if he had any wish that he wanted the party to fulfill.

“Manmohan Ji expressed his desire to see Rahul Gandhi on the top post and work under him. It was his farewell gift to Rahul Ji on his own farewell,” revealed an insider.

Other leaders present at the venue supported Manmohan’s wish and within an hour, final decision was made. A grand coronation ceremony was organized immediately, where in the presence of Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India, Rahul Gandhi took oath as the 14th Prime Minister of India.

“It was the best moment of my life,” a Congress leader claimed, and forwarded the same as an SMS to Sonia Gandhi.

However, Rahul Gandhi is reported to have resigned within an hour of being sown in as the Prime Minister of India.

While the reasons of Rahul Gandhi’s resignation is not known yet, Congressmen hailed his stint as one of the most productive tenure of a Prime Minister in the history of India.

“We noticed a sudden jump in country’s growth rate during those few minutes. Anything like this is unheard of,” claimed a well known writer, who insisted he was neutral and an economist.

“I think Rahul Gandhi is copying Arvind Kejriwal,” a political expert told Faking News, “In order to better Kejriwal’s record, who resigned after 49 days in power, he resigned after 49 minutes only.”

“Or maybe this was all done to stop Modi,” the expert added, “To stop Modi from entering the history books as the first Prime Minister of India who was born after Independence.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/RahulGOT.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-appointing-new-army-chief-outgoing-upa-appoints-rahul-gandhi-as-prime-minister-5365,"After appointing new Army Chief, outgoing UPA appoints Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister",,1400070229.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Congress party leaders, who officially had stated they won’t participate in Exit Polls debate, had in fact had a debate among themselves on the night news channels aired them. Sources tell Faking News that a secret meeting behind closed doors took place at 10 Janpath where some party leaders gathered to analyze and discuss the predicted results.

Sources further inform that the meeting started at a rather ugly note where a concerned Sonia Gandhi rebuked Rahul Gandhi for refusing to change the channel and insisting on watching old episodes of Chhota Bheem.

Scenes from the meeting.

A reluctant Rahul Gandhi handed over the remote to his mother and started sobbing. This is what happened thereafter:

Rajiv Shukla: Please don’t cry Rahul Ji, nahi toh main bhi ro dunga.

Sanjay Jha: Nahi. Main rounga Rahul ji ke saath.

Salman Khurshid: NO. I am senior. I will cry.

Kapil Sibal: Within minutes without having to try, we all are going to cry. (pauses) Wow, that rhymed!

Meanwhile Sonia Gandhi was looking at the remote, apparently thinking of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was not invited to this special meeting. She was jolted out of her thoughts by Sibal’s poetry, and she finally changed the channel.

Times Now is where she landed first. Seeing Arnab on screen, Rahul Gandhi started crying even more loudly and walked out of the room. All leaders get up and try to follow Rahul.

Sonia Gandhi: It’s alright. He will be fine. Let’s see what these guys are saying.

(Everyone starts watching the TV, where Rajasthan figures are flashed on screen)

Sonia Gandhi: (almost choking on her coffee) Holi Ravioli! 14 seats for us and just 10 for BJP. Is it for real???

Ashok Gehlot: Told ya. There is a Gehlot wave in Turkey err..I mean Rajasthan. Assembly elections were just an aberration you see.

Sanjay Jha: On the contrary its because of all the bashing that I have taken in Newshour debates that Arnab has been little generous in Rajasthan.

Digvijay Singh: Exit polls also reflect EVM tamperings?

Rajiv Shukla: I think it was because of Rahul Gandhi’s leadership.

Sonia Gandhi smiles.

Everyone smiles.

Just as the UPA touches three figure mark, all leaders start jumping, giving high-fives to one another, and distributing sweets.

Rajiv Shukla: We have done it. This calls for celebration Sonia ji. It is all because of Indira ji’s vision, Rajiv Ji’s dream, Rahul ji’s guidance and Priyanka ji’s wave in the country.

Sonia Gandhi: Let’s hold on for a minute. (changes channels and lands on News24, run by Rajiv Shukla’s company. News24 predicts massive win for NDA and UPA restricted to 70 seats)

Everyone looks towards Rajiv Shukla.

Kapil Sibal: Why even 70 seats Shukla ji, why not Zero?

Rajiv Shukla: Arey, you forgot? In Gujarat assembly elections, you had claimed that BJP lost because they got lesser seats than expected. This will build expectations and then we can say BJP lost and there is no Modi wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Shabash Shukla Ji. Never thought you could be this intelligent.

Rajiv Shukla: All because of Rahul ji’s leadership.

(At this point they switch over to NDTV, which was showing some program on farming instead of discussing anything political.)

Sonia Gandhi: Ah! That’s why NDTV is my favorite. Always the best channel to watch.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-appoints-new-chief-cook-gardener-and-driver-at-pms-official-residence-5352,"New Delhi. In a controversial move, the outgoing UPA Government appointed Sarson Singh as the Chief Cook at 7 Race Course Road, the official residence of the Prime Minister. The posts of Chief Gardener and Chief Driver were also filled in a hurriedly called cabinet meeting last night.

While Congress is calling it “routine appointments”, leading legal light Ram Jethmalani claimed that that this last-minute appointments of tri-service chiefs smacked of constitutional impropriety.

Sarson Singh

Congress spokesman Manish Tiwari was quick to come to his party’s defense. “The appointment might be hasty, but Sarson ka Saag is tasty!” he insisted, smacking his lips.

BJP was understandably livid, “The incumbent’s retirement isn’t coming up until July 25th. What was the hurry to cook the curry? As per seniority, Khamand Dholakia was supposed to become the next Chief Cook. Are they trying to manipulate the line of succession?”

The controversy re-kindled memories of last year’s expiration date fiasco. The then cook, Doodh Daruwalla had made Ras Malai with Aavin milk that had an expiration date 1 year in the future. However, when the cow was questioned, she revealed that her calf’s date of birth was entered incorrectly in its SSLC certificate. Since the milk production date coincided with the calf’s birth, the PMO suspected that the milk had already gone bad.

The case went to the courts. Expert witness Lalu Yadav testified that fodder quality was paramount to milk’s longevity. The Supreme Court finally asked Daruwalla to sway with the wind and prepare a fresh batch of Ras Malai. The entire dish episode left a sour taste in the mouth.

The relationship between the cook and the PMO had been strained since then. When the Tamilian cow owner Kada Kumar had brought over his fully decorated cows to see Daruwalla on the occasion of Mattu Pongal, 10 Janpath panicked, sensing a coup.

Shekhar Gupta wrote a scathing piece, lambasting Coup-Mata and recommending that the PMO be informed of all future bovine movements, including those of the bowel.

Coming back to the present, the BJP is in no mood to let these appointments go unchallenged.

BJP Spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, “Congress has corrupted every household institution. The gardener is a plant; the maid sweeps everything under the carpet; the cook knows which side of the bread is buttered & the driver is unaware of the bumpy road ahead. The only thing we can get rid of is the 10 year old doormat!”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Halwai.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-appoints-new-chief-cook-gardener-and-driver-at-pms-official-residence-5352,"UPA appoints new Chief Cook, Gardener, and Driver at PM's official residence",,1400051969.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Buoyed with the exit polls prediction that UPA is likely to touch 100 figure mark in Lok Sabha elections, Congress party leaders have unanimously accepted Rahul Gandhi’s huge contribution in achieving the feat and thanked him for helping them out in such an anti-Congress environment.

“I never imagined that a 43-year-young kid could steer us through such a ferocious battle. He is miraculous, and a child prodigy,” said Congress senior leader Salman Khurshid showering praise on Nehru-Gandhi scion.

The power of one.

Mr. Khurshid went on comparing Rahul’s war against so-called communal forces to that of Abhimanyu’s battle in Mahabharat.

“Just like Abhimanyu, I guess Rahul Ji learnt the art of political combat while he was in his mother’s womb, otherwise, there is no way to explain such sharp political acumen at such an early stage of life,” Salman Khurshid thanked Mother India.

There is a section within the Congress party which believes that without being a part of the government, Rahul Gandhi has done what was actually expected from Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh.

“Unfortunately there were a few scams that Manmohan Singh couldn’t stop,” said a prominent party leader making a scathing attack on the Prime Minister, “But thanks to Rahul Ji who single handedly helped us to touch 100 mark, or else we could have reduced to around 10 seats.”

None of the Congress Lok Sabha candidates, who are hopeful of winning, are ready to give themselves even a small fraction of credit. Gyanraj Sharma, a Congress candidate with strong chance of winning from Punjab, reportedly, beat up one of his supporter for publicly giving credit to him.

When we asked Rahul Gandhi, that why were Congressmen so happy even after a prediction of just 100 seats, he said, “Because they are wise people and understand that poverty in terms of Lok Sabha seat is just a state of mind.”

Meanwhile to celebrate the accomplishment, Congress party organized a success bash at party office in Delhi last night, where many leaders including Digvijay Singh were spotted teary eyed.

However, on being enquired, Mr Singh clarified, “These are tears of joy.” He also declared that under the guidance and leadership of youth leader Rahul Gandhi, Congress will rise to power in 2019.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PowerfulRahul.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-thanks-rahul-gandhi-for-helping-upa-touch-100-figure-in-exit-polls-5340,Congress thanks Rahul Gandhi for helping UPA touch 100 figure in Exit Polls,,1399980594.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Exit Polls predicted a certain NDA government at center, BJP has gone into the mode of government formation and taking decisions and post poll planning. Today in a press conference, party president Rajnath Singh said that Narendra Modi will not do any injustice to either Varanasi or Vadodara and will continue as a Member of Parliament for both the constituencies.

He claimed that it was possible to do so with some amendments in the constitution as he was confident that the BJP will form the government with a sweeping majority, which will give it the powers to change the constitution like Indira and Rajiv did.

Har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi.

“Just like technology has been adopted by cricket, our parliament should also adopt it. It shouldn’t be made compulsory for a person to resign from one seat if he wins from two,” Mr. Singh explained.

Rajnath Singh quickly left the press conference as he had to attend meetings to finalize cabinet. Later this Faking News reporter reached out to a party member who disclosed the modus operandi on conditions of anonymity and some donations to his private fund.

He started with the statement, “Itni chhoti baat aap ko samajh nahi aayi yaar, Abki baar modi sarkar!” Later he explained that BJP will be using the same 3D holographic technology which we used for the poll campaign. This way, Narendra Modi can be at two places at a time and thus can represent the two parliamentary seats simultaneously.

Party sources say that the technology has been designed in such a way that the virtual 3D Narendra Modi will be able to debate with the original Narendra Modi, so that the viewers are totally convinced about the dual role he promised to play.

Going further, the BJP is planning to use the same technique to let Narendra Modi continue as the Chief Minister of Gujarat as well as the Prime Minister of India. Constitutional amendments will make it all legal.

The party workers, who aware of this technology, were enthusiastic and one of them was of the opinion that constitution should be further amended to allow Narendra Modi to contest from all the 543 constituencies in the next Lok Sabh elections.

“Even if someone is disqualified for showing poll symbol, or another is denied visa by US, we can always have the original Narendra Modi safe!” said an exited BJP worker.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ModiHologram.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-to-be-mp-from-both-varanasi-and-vadodara-seats-using-3d-holographic-technology-5338,Modi to be MP from both Varanasi and Vadodara seats using 3D holographic technology,,1399969350.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-inspecting-evm-in-amethi-rahul-gandhi-to-star-in-the-repairman-5334,"Mumbai. Rahul Gandhi is all set to become a Bollywood superstar. His first movie ‘The Repairman’ is set to be released this Friday. Following is a special preview of the movie:

Directed by the Election Commission of India, the movie is about a man in his 40s going around repairing all of the machines, which he has no idea of. Like their previous films, this one was targeted by the Directors to appease the Gandhis, the leading Bollywood family.

Raul, a failed Harvard/Rollins dropout passout who lives by repairing his political party (thereby damaging it more), repairs a damaged Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) on a polling day in a small booth in the town Amethi of Uttar Pradesh.

When asked to explain the circumstances that led to his Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) repairing fiasco, he rewinds a little too far… launching into a story as long as a film about his life over the past year.

Rahul Gandhi in and as Repairman

Enter Narendra Modi and his bunch of friends, who are always so ready to criticize him; the PM uncle who’s silently encouraging him to sort his life out; and the reassuring presence of Bianca, a young farmer’s wife who’s moved to Amethi and seems to be the only person who understands him. For a while, at least.

The director, Election Commission, has tried to tell a inspiring story of how a person who does not know anything about repair, trying his hands out in repairing complex machines. But the movie fails in the logical aspect like the ‘hero Raul trying to repair the EVM by telling that he will empower it again and again and again’.

The strong emotional pull of the movie is however revealed in the scenes where Raul’s brother-in-law Varda who is a poor Indian farmer trying to live with his small farming land. His plight is laughed off by the villain, BJP members, upon whom the anger of audience is entirely invisible.

The villains in the flashback are ruthless, with the antagonist Modi (whose screen presence is sure of scaring the “intellectual” audience) going after the poor hero by snatching his toffee from him outside the candy shop which moves us emotionally. Also, there is this scene of interaction with another sadist villain Arnab Goswami, who shames the hero by unnecessary questions.

But the pillars of movie are Raul’s friends – Sanjay Jha, Digvijay Singh and Arvind Kejriwal. Sanjay Jha goes after people who mock Raul and there is a sweet romantic portion for Digvijay Singh. We can see the future of Indian drama and cinema in Arvind Kejriwal, whose acting skills are going to make directors queue outside his home.

Our verdict for this movie is less than 100 out of 540, while reviews from Rigged newspaper (ran by the Director of this movie) might make it 500 out of 540. And the bottomline of the movie is, “If Raul can repair something, you can very well do it, so stop saying that ‘you don’t know’ next time your parents ask you to repair that equipment in your home.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/REPAIRMAN.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-inspecting-evm-in-amethi-rahul-gandhi-to-star-in-the-repairman-5334,"After inspecting EVM in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi to star in ""The Repairman""",,1399900786.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after flaunting his party symbol at poll booth, Ajay Rai, the Congress candidate from Varanasi, has requested Election Commission to immediately send him to jail.

At the same time, Congress has asked BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to follow Ajay Rai’s footsteps and get himself arrested in a similar case which is pending against him.

“I have committed a crime, hit me on my head with the mike which you are holding.”

Reportedly, Ajay Rai realized that he was committing such a heinous crime only after one of his close associate Gyani Shukla, who was standing ahead of him in the voting queue pointed at the Congress badge on his Kurta.

“The moment he saw the badge with party symbol, he removed it and threw it away, as if it was a bomb. He was yelling, ‘mujhse paap ho gaya, ab to prayashcit karna hi padega‘,” revealed Gyani, narrating the incident which happened at the booth.

“Ajay babu ran toward Ganga river and jumped into it to wash the sin which he committed by violating model code of conduct. Modi didn’t even go for Ganga aarti!” Gyani added.

Even after coming to know that an FIR has been lodged against him, Ajay Rai didn’t cool down. As per Mr Rai’s family members, he even whipped himself 100 times for his act.

Later, unable to get guilt out of his mind, Ajay Rai finally reached local police station to get arrested.

Sources say that an ugly spat took place between Mr Rai supporters and policemen. “Ajay Rai forcibly tried to get himself inside holding cell by breaking the lock. First time in my life, I saw someone breaking lock-up to get inside,” disclosed a source.

However, after policemen offered to arrest Ajay Rai in one of the 9 pending criminal cases against him, he ran away from the police station.

Meanwhile Ajay Rai’s own party Congress has given Election Commission the full freedom to take all possible measures to punish Ajay Rai and Narendra Modi.

“No disciplinary action is enough for the crime which Mr Rai has committed,” said Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari reacting to the situation. “But look at the modesty with which he is ready to accept any punishment. Mr. Modi don’t have guts to do that. He should take some inspiration from his rival in Varanasi and get himself arrested!”

Meanwhile, impressed with Ajay Rai’s love for the law, Congress has offered him PM post in UPA 3, which he refused.

“For god sake, there is a charge of flaunting party symbol near poll booth against me. Such a heinous crime! I have no right to become Prime Minister of this country,” said Mr. Rai.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AjayRai.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ajay-rai-wants-to-go-to-jail-for-flaunting-party-symbol-congress-says-good-send-modi-too-5332,"Ajay Rai wants to go to jail for flaunting party symbol; Congress says, ""Good, send Modi too""",,1399900131.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a joint meeting held by the representatives of all leading news channels last evening, it was unanimously decided to give at least 150 seats to AAP in every exit poll that will be telecast today after 6:30 pm.

The channels took this decision to avoid Aroon Purie like situation, where Kejriwal accused him selling his soul to Narendra Modi and called his opinion poll on Varanasi, farzi.

“We’ll have to fix these polls in favor of AAP to avoid the polls being called fixed by their leadership,” a journalist revealed their strategy.

AAP supporters insisted that the right spelling of “anya” was “aap” and news channel was not disclosing the truth.

“150 seats have been set aside for AAP. The real exit polls will be for remaining 393 seats only. Whatever data we have for 543 seats, we will interpolate it for these 393 seats,” he further confirmed how it will work.

“Things have been very good between me and Arvind so far, he hasn’t called me a paid Modi agent even once, and I don’t want to spoil my relations with him by doing an honest exit poll!” a krantikaari journalist told Faking News.

While majority of the channels have reserved 150 seats for AAP, a few other are even willing to directly ask Kejriwal how many seats he thinks AAP will win, so that there is no scope of corruption and farziness left in their predictions.

“You never know he may want AAP to get a complete majority, and here we are showing only 150 seats,” a psephologist from an exit poll agency explained, “So we may even take help of Yogendra Yadav’s internal surveys if need be.”

Meanwhile Kejriwal has already lashed out at Exit Polls on Twitter, hinting they should probably be done after results are out.

“72 hours before results, News Channels are going to show exit polls. Why? What r ur intentions paid jounos?” read his tweet.

Making sensational claims about the presence of huge crowd in Rahul Gandhi’s roadshow earlier today, BJP has alleged that Congress had gathered people by falsely claiming that it was Rahul Gandhi’s baraat (wedding procession) and baratis will get free food.

“Congress has used this strategy in many of Rahul’s earlier roadshows too, there is nothing new in it. And why do you think Rahul is still unmarried? Just to repeat this drama again and again for political benefits,” claimed BJP’s chief conspiracy theorist Subramanian Swamy.

Baraat, in BJP’s eyes.

Mr. Swamy cited the presence of shehnai music and vedic matras being played in the roadshow as clinching evidences of his theory that the roadshow was falsely marketed as Rahul Gandhi’s wedding procession.

“This was to make people believe that it was indeed Rahul’s baraat. Otherwise, who plays shehnai in a political roadshow?” argued Swamy, “And above that, we have also spotted a band playing Bollywood tracks in the roadshow. What more proof do we need?”

“Buddhu has finally made others buddhu!” he concluded in his trademark style.

Unable to explain the presence of crowds in Rahul Gandhi’s roadshow, the BJP has decided to go with Swamy’s theory. The party later released pics of people dancing and carrying garlands in their hands, proving that people mistook the roadshow as baraat.

“It is a common sight in every Indian baraat; baraatis do carry garlands to put them around necks of bride-side people. It proves that many in the roadshow were thinking that they were part of Rahul’s baraat,” Janaardhan Mishra, a member of BJP’s local unit demanded that Election Commission should add the baraat budget in Congress election expenses.

However, Congress party has flatly rejected BJP’s assertions and called it a conspiracy theory fabricated to conceal the nervousness of the saffron party.

“If it was a baraat, why were there no stickers reading ‘Rahul Weds XYZ’ on the vehicles that were part of the procession? People are not that fool as we think!” reacted Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who claimed that there was huge Rahul Gandhi wave and today’s roadshow proved that UPA will return to power in a week.

But BJP is sticking to its conspiracy theory. In response to Khurshid’s poser, BJP’s Ravishankar Prasad told Faking News that most of the baraatis never care about stickers or who is getting married to whom, because all they care about is free food and naagin dance.

When we tried to get Rahul Gandhi’s response on BJP’s claims, he refused to make any comment, but sources say that he blushed.

But the most convincing counter to BJP’s conspiracy theory came from Congress’ own conspiracy theorist Digvijay Singh, who initially refused to talk to us when he heard about wedding and baraat. When we said that it was not a personal question, he agreed to speak to us.

“They are eating all the paans available in the city, and because of that local people are suffering from malnutrition. I met a resident of Godowlia area; he hasn’t been able to get a single paan in the last 15 days!” Raj Thackeray disclosed the grave ground reality.

“Locals are not even able to take a dip in Ganga, as Ganga is filled with outsiders. Every day, one or the other leader and their supporters are doing drama on the river bank,” Raj added further, “Now I am here, and I will not let others devoid Banarasi Manoos of their rights!”

Varanasi unit of MNS, which has been named “Banaras Navnirman Sena (BNS)”, is acting in full swing and getting a lot of support from residents of the city.

BNS says that the local people are facing trouble in commuting across the city because of the regular roadshows conducted by outsiders and due to thousands of journalists in the city from hundreds of news channels asking them random questions.

“We are going to hire a few helicopters to carry locals from their homes to offices, schools and colleges,” a volunteer of BNS declared the grand plans of the newly formed Thackeray party.

However, he quickly added that his party will not be shying away from resorting to extreme measures, for which they are well known and widely respected.

A volunteer of BNS revealed to Faking News that they were running a silent campaign against the outsiders by mixing jamalgota (a laxative) in paans being sold at paan bhandaars. “Bahut Banarasi paan khaane ka shaukh hai unko, let them eat and shit,” he quipped with an evil smirk on his face.

Few of the other tricks being used by BNS is offering outsiders lassi with overdose of bhaang. Reportedly, few days back, they put a couple of outsiders high on bhaang in a boat in Ganga, and set them off sailing, after convincing them that the boat would take them to Switzerland.

Besides these, some reports of outsiders being thrown directly into the Ganga by BNS volunteers is also there.

Meanwhile, a group of AAP supporters claimed that they were slapped by BJP supporters. But soon after the news went public, Raj Thackeray’s party rejected their claims and took the responsibility of the act.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CrowdIndia.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/with-so-many-outsiders-in-varanasi-raj-thackeray-comes-out-in-support-of-locals-5307,"With so many outsiders in Varanasi, Raj Thackeray comes out in support of locals",,1399633397.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“It needs a large heart to do such things”

“I fail to understand how you could not provide a comfortable life for your buffaloes who spent their entire life bull shitting for you and trying to ensure a brighter future for you. Your buffaloes are like my fellow Congressmen. I have immense respect for them. I may not be as resourceful as you are, but I would request you to allow me to provide them all the necessary comforts of life according to my capacity,” Rashid Alvi said in a letter to Azam Khan.

Alvi lamented that Azam Khan has been telling in his campaign all along that his buffaloes saved him single-handedly in the most difficult conditions.

“You mentioned how they had to graze in the neighboring lawns to ensure that they could look after you properly. If you check their DNAs, you will be surprised to know that it is no different from that of Congressmen and Samajwadi Party men.”

“With their dedication and hard work, they brought you up in a way that you could not only rise to become a Minister in a state like UP, but also want on to become the PM candidate of your party,” he told Azam Khan. At the same time, he told Azam Khan that he was “deeply pained” when he came to know that the buffaloes of the UP Minister still live in an 8X8 shed.

“I was also distressed when I saw that they traveled on foot to escape from your house recently,” he said, noting that in Indian culture, when the Master does well in life, the first beneficiaries of the success are usually his buffaloes.

“Azam Khan ji, recently when you filed your nomination, you disclosed assets worth more than Rs 1.75 crores and a few criminal cases against you. I am baffled how even as an ordinary criminal, who has so much wealth, you fail to provide necessary comforts to your buffaloes!”

“We regularly see how you travel in private jets and cavalcades of many luxury cars. We also know of your love for study tours to Mont Blanc, Istanbul, Amsterdam, Dubai and other places. You travel in Business class while Congressmen like Shashi Tharoor travel in cattle class with other secular buffaloes,” he added.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Rashid-Alvi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-rashid-alvi-writes-to-azam-khan-offering-to-take-care-of-his-buffaloes-5301,Congress leader Rashid Alvi writes to Azam Khan offering to take care of his buffaloes,,1399549633.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While campaigning for Gul Panag, the AAP candidate from the ‘city beautiful’, Raghu of Roadies fame promised 50% reservation for people of Chandigarh, if they voted the rookie party to power.

With this announcement, Aam Aadmi Party has seemingly captured the mood of the local youth, and considering the craze for the reality show among the city’s youngsters, Gul Panag is being seen as a clear winner from the constituency.

“I am what I am”

“I always felt that Chandigarh has the capacity to provide many more Roadies than we usually select from here. 50% reservation will ensure that we select almost all the deserving candidates, instead of being forced to select just 3-4 people,” said Raghu while addressing a gathering comprising of aspiring Roadies and media men.

Raghu’s lofty promise targeting the first time voters has led to celebrations across the whole city.

“Now I am going to vote for AAP, nobody can stop me. I will even convince my family members to vote for AAP, I am sure they will agree, after all it’s about my career!” said Balwinder Singh, a final year engineering student.

“Roadies, I am coming, Raghu I am coming, Ranvijay I am coming. I am what I am, #@$%#%%,” Balwinder finished talking on a high note.

Raghu’s declaration has not only struck a chord with the first time voters, but has also provided some respite to many others who have been trying to get into Roadies for years.

Rohit Sharma, a man in his early 30s has been trying to get selected for Roadies since season one.

“Raghu sir’s promise is like the last ray of hope for me and many others like me. My hair is turning grey, but still I haven’t got an opportunity to showcase my talent of abusing and shouting loud,” teary eyed Rohit described his pain. Rohit feels that reservation in Roadies was necessary for social upliftment of people like him.

Meanwhile sensing a business opportunity, a couple of ex-Roadies have even started a coaching class to teach people, how to clear Roadies’ form filling, group discussion, and personal interview.

Energized by the public response, Chandigarh AAP has created a separate team to educate these young Roadies fans about voting process to ensure that the excitement is translated into votes.

“It is basically for those hardcore Roadies fans who believe that you need to vote for the opposition to vote them out. It’s just a precautionary measure to make sure that they don’t press the BJP’s symbol to vote out Kirron Kher,” revealed an AAP volunteer.

Meanwhile, BJP candidate Kirron Kher has promised a similar reservation for locals in ‘India’s Got Talent’. “Mat bano Roadies, bano asli star, abki baar Modi sarkar,” roared Kirron Kher while promoting her promise.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RaghuAAP.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-set-to-win-chandigarh-after-raghu-promises-50-reservation-in-roadies-for-locals-5036,AAP set to win Chandigarh after Raghu promises 50% reservation in Roadies for locals,,1396696263.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While trying to kill a mosquito sitting on his cheek, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal accidentally ended up slapping himself. However, the sight of Kejriwal being slapped angered his supporters so much that they ended up attacking the assaulter i.e. Kejriwal himself.

Sources tell Faking News that the AAP supremo was constantly urging his supporters to calm down, but the emotionally charged up supporters didn’t listen to their leader.

Kejriwal’s close aides taking him away from the angry supporters.

“We won’t let anybody hit Kejriwal sir, even if it is Kejriwal sir. We will teach a lesson to anyone daring to intimidate our leader,” said a furious AAP supporter when asked about the reason why he attacked his own party leader.

AAP supporters cooled down only after Kejriwal cleared the doubt and revealed that it was a mosquito that he was trying to kill, and that there was no intention of hurting himself.

Kejriwal further blamed BJP to clam down his supporters.

“What I felt from my short interaction with that mosquito that it was trained. I think BJP and Ambani are behind it. Considering the amount of money they have, they can do anything,” the former CM of Delhi lashed out at the saffron party.

“Those who have hatched this plan knew that my supporters were going to attack me if I accidentally slap myself. They capitalized on the anger of the AAP supporters and tried to disturb internal peace of my party,” Kejriwal exposed the devious plans.

While the AAP chief was successful in calming down the supporters, he was shocked to see such reaction from them. Sources say that the party is thinking of organizing anger management classes at their office in Delhi.

Meanwhile the allegedly “paid mosquito” is still at large and AAP members are searching it in the streets of Delhi.

Party insiders reveal that in Chandni Chowk area they have spotted a mosquito sitting along with a swarm of mosquitoes as if they were doing some kind of dharna.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has declared “Secularism”, speculated to be worth 20 crore votes, as an asset while filing nomination papers for the general elections from her constituency Raebareli.

In the affidavit giving details of assets owned by her, she mentioned it as an immovable property, which she inherited from her in-laws.

Secularly rich family.

“Yes, it’s indeed an asset for my mother and subsequently an asset for Congress too. My grandmother, my father, my mother, me, and my party have worked really hard to earn it and we are very proud of it,” said Rahul Gandhi who was accompanying Mrs. Gandhi at the district collectorate.

It’s being seen as an attempt by the grand old party to pass a strong message among the minorities of India.

“Look, how much she cares about secularism that she is putting it on the same level as that of money, gold, and real estate. It’s hard to find someone with such a love for secularism,” explained a senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh highlighting Mrs. Gandhi’s level of commitment toward the cause.

To gain a deep insight into how secular affluence is going to help Sonia Gandhi in the upcoming general elections, Faking News talked to famous election analyst Chunavi Chaudhary.

“In the current electoral market, it’s one of the hottest commodity that politicians are trading in. It has power to get you political allies. All you need to do is to keep it close to you, that’s all and it pays high dividend during elections,” described Chunavi Chaudhary.

“Secularism has been a very important asset for Congress and it has helped the party on numerous occasions. And as Sonia Gandhi is trying to get her property certified by Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari, it’s value is going to skyrocket for sure,” Mr Chaudhary added further.

Reportedly, Sonia Gandhi has even loaned a bit of secularism to Lalu Yadav, Congress political ally in Bihar. However, Lalu downplayed the claims. “Are budbak, ulta I have given her loan,” Lalu claimed

Meanwhile, Sonia’s property declaration has irked other secular leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Nitish Kumar.

After critics attacked Modi over his false developmental claims and proved how backward Gujarat is, Gujarat government has decided to demand special category state status from the central government.

Gujarat government hopes that the special category status – usually given to underdeveloped states with governments that are supporting the central government – will help Gujarat overcome its backwardness.

A posh area of Ahmedabad.

This decision of Gujarat government comes as a huge surprise to critics of Narendra Modi who have exposed him incessantly on his developmental claims.

Later, our paid reporter investigated why Gujarat government has taken such a drastic step and also talked to various critics of Modi.

On being asked about the surprising move, chief secretary(Government of Gujarat) explained, “After allegations by Arvind Kejriwal and opposition leaders about the developmental claims of Gujarat being false, we investigated the allegations and found them to be true. Gujarat has no development in last 10 years. In fact, on a closer study we found that Gujarat’s economy has actually deteriorated in the last decade.”

“On realizing that Gujarat developmental model has failed, we started looking for alternative developmental models. Then we came across Bihar Model and found it the best. Following the model we’ve also demanded special category status from center,” he added further.

Our reporter then approached critics of Modi to seek their response. On being asked to comment Arvind Kejriwal, who visited Gujarat few days ago to verify development of Gujarat but found none, said, “Modi is lying. Next week I’ll go to Gujarat to verify backwardness claims of Modi government.”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh lashed out at Modi over the move, “Modi has done nothing to impoverish Gujarat, its the hardlyworking population of Gujarat which has achieved underdevelopment, besides Gujarat has a history of underdevelopment going back to centuries.”

Modi’s Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar didn’t take kindly to this development, he is reported to have said that Gujarat underdevelopment is a hype and it was Bihar that was more underdeveloped and deserves special category status.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-promises-to-build-a-pipeline-between-gas-planet-jupiter-and-earth-if-voted-to-power-5010,"Delhi. Addressing a public gathering in the capital, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has promised to build a pipeline between Earth and gas giant Jupiter, if his party is voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections.

Jupiter, one of the four gas planets beside Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, is composed primarily of Hydrogen, which is often considered as fuel of the future.

Simple, elegant and visionary plan.

“We are determined to fix the gas problem which our country is facing. Construction of a pipeline between Earth and Jupiter is going to free us from the claws of gas exploration companies,” declared Kejriwal amidst chanting of ‘Jupiter zindabad’ by excited AAP supporters.

“It’s just a one time cost, after that there will be nothing but gas; I mean we will distribute gas free of cost,” added Kejriwal.

“Each household will be having a direct connection from the main pipeline, people will be having freedom to use it as they wish,” he explained the benefits of AAP government.

The rookie party has included building of gas pipeline in their manifesto. After consuming whole of Jupiter, their plan is to add few extra hundred million miles of pipe to the existing system and then start consuming Saturn.

AAP bashed gas exploration companies like Reliance Industries and Chevron Corporation of intentionally avoiding Jupiter as source of gas. “The sheer abundance of gas is going to bring down the gas price, that’s why they are afraid of exploring Jupiter. It’s a big conspiracy,” claimed another AAP leader.

Kejriwal also blamed his political rival Modi of being hand in gloves with Ambani to keep Jupiter’s gas potential out of election agenda.

“Modi never talked about Jupiter. AAP is the only party which has courage to raise this issue, this is real pro-development attitude and foresightedness,” claimed Kejriwal lashing out at Modi.

However, on being asked how they are going to build such long pipeline, Kejriwal said, “Desh ka aam aadmi jag chuka hai, so please, don’t underestimate the power of a common man.”

Meanwhile, Congress has accused AAP of hijacking his Rahul Gandhi’s Jupiter’s agenda. “It was Rahul ji who first brought Jupiter into picture and AAP is capitalizing on that,” Congress leader Salman Khurshid said while attacking AAP.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EarthJupiter.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-promises-to-build-a-pipeline-between-gas-planet-jupiter-and-earth-if-voted-to-power-5010,"Kejriwal promises to build a pipeline between gas planet Jupiter and Earth, if voted to power",,1396432239.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kejriwal’s deafening silence caught media attention after no verbal attacks on BJP, Congress, Ambani, and Adani by him were recorded since this morning.

Trying to keep his mouth shut.

When asked about the reason of this surprising silence, Kejriwal clarified, “No matter what you say, people don’t take you seriously on 1st of April. So better not to make such sensitive allegations on 1st April, as people might confuse it as some prank.”

“For today, all politicians are honest, no media is paid, and I am an idiot. It’s one of those rare days when sun rose from the west,” quipped Kejriwal.

However, sources reveal that it all started last midnight when Kejriwal, while having a chat with his close aide, reiterated his famous dialogue, ‘Sab mile huye hain’, following which his aide started laughing as he was reading April Fools’ Day jokes on Twitter at the same time.

It was then Kejriwal decided to keep his mouth shut for the whole day.

As per political experts, it’s a much required break which Kejriwal needed to maintain his high spirits. “He has been playing this blame game recklessly for last few months. This break is going to detoxicate him,” explained a political analyst.

This is the first day since Kejriwal formed his party when he will be spending 24 hours without calling rival politicians and big businessmen corrupt and thief.

Even Kejriwal accept the fact that, it’s not going to be easy for him to pass a whole day just like a normal person. “It’s like navrata fasting and I am really not habituated to this,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

Reportedly, Kejriwal was feeling very suffocated in the morning.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,"Bangalore. In order to attract unemployed engineers of the city, Congress candidate from Bangalore South, Nandan Nilekani has promised a scheme similar to MGNREGA.

“Rajiv Gandhi National Technology Employment Guarantee Act (RGNTEGA) will ensure at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to all the unemployed software engineers of Bangalore,” said Nilekani while announcing his second most ambitious project after Aadhaar Card.

“I know them, now they are going to vote for me.”

“It’s not a new thing for me, as even when I was in Infosys, we used to do bulk hiring from engineering colleges. It was the same work, but in corporate style,” Nilekani added further, highlighting his past work experience of handling such projects.

When asked about possible danger of RGNTEGA meeting the same fate as that of Aadhaar Card scheme, Nilekani rejected the apprehension and said that the presence of ‘Rajiv Gandhi’ in project name is sufficient enough for its success.

As per sources close to Nilekani, most of the engineers getting employment through RGNTEGA would be working on a dream web project of Rahul Gandhi.

“Rahul wants to empower Indians by creating a website with combined features of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, IRCTC, YouTube, Wikipedia and LinkedIn,” a Congress insider revealed to Faking News.

“When it comes to being a visionary, his imagination knows no boundaries,” the insider explained.

Considering huge population of jobless engineers in Bangalore, Nilekani’s move is being seen as a masterstroke.

Even the punchline of the scheme, ‘Har ungli shakti, har ungli tarakki‘, which reportedly was coined by Congress VP Rahul Gandhi, is quite apt and going viral among the jobless IT crowd.

Although many of the jobless engineers are happy with the news, they are also expecting ‘bench’ culture during their employment period under RGNTEGA.

“Job and all are fine, but for a proper work life balance, a minimum 20 days of bench warming would be good enough,” said a 2010 engineering pass out. With elections round the corner, it’s highly probable that Nilekani would agree to engineers’ demand.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Nandan-Nilekani.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,Nandan Nilekani promises scheme like NREGA for unemployed engineers of Bangalore,,1396273152.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The people who attended the gathering were astounded by the intense silence of the Prime Minister and started meditating. Few claim to be enlightened.

Golden silence

A local school teacher, who spoke to our correspondent said, “A subject on our Prime Minister’s silence should be inducted into our curriculum to ensure that students are silent in class.”

The school teacher also remarked that he will tweet Dr. Shashi Tharoor about it. Another local who was awed by the speech silence, remarked, “He sounded just like James Bond when he said his last and only two words: Theek Hai!”

Among those inspired were three engineering students – Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. They have decided to improve the country’s economic situation by extracting gold from the Prime Minister’s silence. The students told Faking News, “We want to prove that Silence is indeed golden.”

The rally came to an end when a cop, ACP Jai Dixit broke the silence and questioned the Prime Minister as to why he hasn’t been promoted since 2004.

The supercop had recently helped the Chicago Police Department in catching a criminal and his autistic twin, and yet did not get a promotion. Apparently, this is when the Prime minister said Theek Hai and concluded the meditation camp rally.

Home Minister Mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde later issued a statement saying, “ACP Jai Dixit is getting promotions without his Knowledge.”

Meanwhile this radical approach of campaigning has garnered a lot of interest. Congress spokesman Jha praised the leadership of the party for this innovation. “This is a huge success of Rahul baba’s policies. Now we know he is not only an expert in tearing and throwing policies but also an expert in making them,” claimed Jha.

But members of the opposing parties have claimed that the Prime Minister’s rally was nonsense. Mr.Rahul Gandhi, who was visibly infuriated by the comments, came in support of his Prime Minister and a made a statement saying, “This is outrageous. Only I can say nonsense when it comes to our Prime Minister. Who do they think they are?”

In a hurriedly called press conference, which was attended by half of his own media men turned AAP members, he declared, “There is no 100% safety as proclaimed by Dettol model of cleanliness by a crony capitalist company like Reckitt Benckiser.”

Exposed!!

He also alleged that his research team has shown that Reckitt Benckiser is actually owned by Ambani and Adani through a highly sophisticated maze of share holdings and cross-investments, and that the entire idea behind this “propaganda” in “paid media” was done by Narendra Modi to ensure that Ambani and Adani, via their crony company Reckitt Benckiser, would be able to spread this false assurance in the rest of India that Dettol is 100% safe.

He further claimed that he has personally examined his hands after being washed by Dettol Hand Wash and found 0.01 % of germs still remaining. When counter questioned by an attending journalist that this proved that 99.99% of the germs were indeed killed, he thundered back accusing the journalist of being “paid” and said, “aap sab bike hue hai. All of you are paid. What about 0.01% germs ? Where is the cleanliness, hygiene and safety as promised by Dettol? If you cannot remove even 0.01 % of germs, how can you claim to clean the entire country?”

The journalist who asked the question was left wondering if he should work for free from now onward to avoid being labelled “paid” by all and sundry.

When asked why he was not saying anything about what had caused the 99.99% of the germs on his hands, in the first place, he did not give a straight answer. He only said, “Please provide evidence that my hands are in a mess because of the filth created in this country governed by Congress for more than 60 years out of 67 years and I will arrest the germ causing agent in less than 3 hours.”

“Main bahut chotta aadmi hun, meri koi auqaat nahi hai, lekin main is desh ki hygiene habits badalne aya hun. I will ensure that when my government comes to power, I will remove 100% of the germs by bringing in my own version of ‘GermThokPal’ bill. Is desh ka aam admi ab jaag gaya hai and he will not tolerate even 0.01% of the germs,” he went on to add.

The press conference ended on a happy note when some AAP members showered each other with black ink, and then promptly proceeded to wash the ink stains off with Dettol.

Punya Prasoon Bajpai termed the press conference as “Krantikari, bahut krantikari.“

In a shocking move, BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi has decided to opt out from the race of country’s top job. Experts say that he peaked too early and felt symptoms of fatigue, ending in voluntary withdrawal from the race.

Totally confused about what to do and not willing to go back to LK Adavni, BJP announced that Coder Singh, a 33-year-old person with no political experience, was their new PM candidate. Coder Singh is an ex-software engineer with 5 years of development experience in .NET, a Microsoft developed framework.

Communal Code

But despite his blank political background, he is being called a communal, controversial, divisive, and a threat to the “idea of India” by the same people who earlier claimed that they were opposed to Modi only, and not BJP per se.

“Hinduism, I mean, Hindu nationalism is a threat to this country and Coder’s mind must be decoded. I think he is dangerous to our pluralistic society,” Panchsheel Tripathi, a London based liberal tweeted within two minutes of BJP announcing its new candidate.

Not only alleged intellectuals, but political opponents too announced that they will not let Coder get success in capturing Delhi.

Soon after the announcement, UPA cabinet passed an ordinance to bring software codes written in private companies under RTI. Reportedly, they did so to dig into Coder’s past work. They hired some top class software engineers, not under eNREGA scheme that is used to hire only low class trolls but under professional contracts, to scrutinize the codes written by Coder Singh.

Apparently the hired software engineers could find some bug, which led Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to launch a scathing attack on Coder Singh. She immediately called him “Bug ka Saudagar” and her fellow party members made serious allegations about his past.

“We found ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in one of the comments that he added in his code block while working for a software company in 2012. This is the new face of Internet Hindus and right-wing ideology,” claimed Digvijay Singh showing a snippet of the code as proof.

However, Coder Singh himself is very proud of his coding past. He even showed a bug-free application that he developed while working with one of the companies.

“It has been given clean chit by testers of that company, it’s totally bug free and many have praised my codes for being as beautiful as poetry,” the new PM candidate of BJP told Faking News.

However claims of being bug free was rejected by AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who raised question marks over the quality of application developed by Coder Singh.

“Who are these testers, sab mile huye hain ji. I have tested it rigorously for 2 days, it’s flawed and buggy,” claimed Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference.

On being asked about specific details of the bugs, he warned media to not doubt his testing skills. “Although I have no development experience, but I am a born tester,” he said.

Kejriwal even slammed Coder Singh for working on Microsoft Technologies.

“Why he didn’t use open source frameworks? Why he preferred C# over PHP? He is hand in gloves with tech goon Microsoft. If he comes to power, he is going to promote Bill Gates agenda and all open source coders will die without job,” Kejriwal claimed.

Latest reports suggest that BJP is planning to drop Coder Singh as PM candidate and look for a candidate that will be accepted by people who would anyway never vote for the party.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommunalCode-300x151.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"Modi opts out of PM race, BJP puts up an ex-software engineer as new candidate",,1396009520.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,"New Delhi. In a blow to Rahul Gandhi’s dreams of an India full of rights, the left-handed community has come out strongly against the recent spate of ‘Right to xyz’ bills proposed by the Congress.

“Congress claims to work for minorities, but why is it ignoring the handedness minority?” asked an angry Vaman, President of All India Left-handers’ Association, who works with the MNC Bayer.

When explained that the names of the bills have possibly misled him, he retorted, “Oh yeah?Next you will tell me that the name ‘Indian Premier League’ is misleading and it is held in UAE… Oh wait…”

One of the protesters

“But there is no confusion,” he quickly added, “If there could be a ‘Right to Entrepreneurship’ in the party manifesto, why not ‘Right to Left handed writing’ too? I mean, both of these make equal sense.”

“Or the best would be if they change their symbol from right hand to left hand,” he demanded.

But lefties are not the only one to object to the move; the moment Congress’s new manifesto was announced, Leftist parties vociferously opposed what they referred to as ‘poisonous rightist policies’. Later the high-level think-tanks of these parties opined that these policies were, in fact, leftist, and hence the opposition was hastily withdrawn and underplayed.

When asked by this reporter if the bills were against lefties, a Congressman emphatically said, “Rahul Gandhi will tell you the importance of the bills.” When asked about the whereabouts of Rahul Gandhi, he revealed that it was Rahul Gandhi himself speaking.

He then continued, “You people laugh at me when I answer every question by saying that we passed the Right to Information Act. Now I will pass so many ‘Right to fill-in-the-blanks’ bills that I can answer any question you ask. So next time you ask me if I’m afraid of losing to Narendra Modi, I will tell you that we passed the Right to be Unafraid of Narendra Modi Act. Genius, no?”

When further pressed on the actual contents of these bills, Rahul Gandhi said that they will empower women, and after pausing for effect, added, “Both right-handed AND left-handed.”

AAP workers’ reactions were even more scathing.

“The bills are a right-wing conspiracy,” a junior worker holding a broom in his left hand said, “thus proving that the Congress and BJP are one and the same.”

A BJP party worker blamed it all on Sonia Gandhi. “There is clearly a foreign right hand behind the bills.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/left-handed-products.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,Left-handed community gets offended by Congress’ spate of ‘Right to’ bills,,1395996280.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-introduce-inkpal-bill-that-will-ban-ink-and-fountain-pens-if-voted-to-power-4971,"Varanasi. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced today at a rally that if voted to power, AAP will introduce an Inkpal bill that will have provisions to ban manufacture, sale, and possession of all kinds of ink and fountain pens. This comes in the wake of a sharp upswing in the number of incidents involving ink throwing at politicians.

The move has been supported by all political parties and thus, the Inkpal bill is expected to be passed easily in the Parliament. As per the Inkpal bill, possession of ink of any color will be punishable under POTA as well as under section 302 of the IPC.

Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has always been on the hit list of ink throwing wannabe patriots, has demanded that the fountain pen be classified under ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’ and that all leading corrupt nations should come forward and sign a treaty ratifying this.

“Ink throwing is a black mark on Indian democracy, and Rahul Baba always hated ink, pens anyway,” muttered the Congress leader before putting on his helmet back to avoid being inked.

The attack that led AAP leaders to demand Inkpal Bill.

AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha too has voiced her support saying she was anguished at the very thought of someone smudging her precious silk sarees with black ink.

The RSS has however opposed this move, saying that an exception should be made for Saffron ink. Similar views have been echoed by the IUML which said that the proposal to ban Green colored ink was a conspiracy against the minority community by Narendra Modi. Noticeably, right wing leader Pramod Mutalik has maintained a studied silence on this issue.

However, economists have cautioned against any hasty moves to ban ink as it could have major ramifications on the economy.

“With so many corrupt and irritating politicians around, many small scale ink factories have come up to fulfill the demand for black ink, they will have nowhere to go if the Inkpal bill becomes a reality,” said leading economist Swami S Inklesariya Iyer.

Economists have further warned that such a move could also affect bilateral trade relations with our neighbors. Pakistan, which is a major manufacturer and supplier of counterfeit ink, has threatened to take this issue to the WTO, UN, and the UNHRC.

Rubber Stamp Dealers Association (RSDA) secretary Manhoman Singh too lamented the move and pointed out that it will lead to loss of jobs. “How do they expect good quality rubber stamps without any ink?” he asked in agony.

The Indian Dental Association has vowed to protest against the proposed Inkpal bill, tooth and nail. Our sources say that dentists around India were making a killing with so many politicians with black ink stains turning up for a flossing and cleaning session. Although with most of India’s politicians being over 85 and having lost their dentures long ago, this argument doesn’t hold much water.

In hindsight, a few proactive steps by Election Commission could have ensure in getting healthy voter turnouts:

1. Polling Booth inside Dadar Station: Installing a polling booth inside Dadar Station alone could have ensured a 70-80% turnout in Mumbai. In addition to this, one poll booth in one Kalyan bound fast local in the evening hours itself could have added another 15% of Mumbai votes.

2. Election Commission should have picked up and forcefully made people loitering aimlessly outside Salman Khan’s galaxy apartment residence and Shahrukh Khan’s mannat residence to vote. That could have upped the turnout by another 5-10%.

3. Threat to ban on Vada Pavs: A Mumbaikar may go without oxygen for a day, but Vada Pav is his staple diet. There have been instances when fights have broken out over Vada Pavs. For Mumbaikars it is Jar, Joru, Jameen and Vada Pav. A threat to ban this very symbol of survival if people don’t vote could have ensured a good turnout.

Few people from Bollywood who may be outcast after they recklessly turned up to vote.

4. Approaching vehicles on SV Road: Had Election Commission asked its officers to approach every vehicle stuck in a jam (big or small) on SV Road during evening, and made them vote on a portable EVM then and there, it would have ensured good turnout.

5. EC could have tied up with developers/owners of Candy Crush, Temple Run, etc. and asked them to allow only those who have voted to play these games. They would have agreed to it as a part of their Corporate Social responsibility.

6. Twitter/Facebook: Especially for Mumbai people, EC could have come up with an option to vote directly from Twitter and Facebook accounts. People could have voted which could have generates an automated tweet like I have voted for AAP/BJP/MNS. Have you?

7. Vote from home: Another facility for lazy rich brats of Mumbai, where in by shelling few lakhs they could have availed service of having a dedicate EVM directly couriered to their homes, on which they could have then hired another person to just press the button.

8. EC could have hired professional photographers like Daboo Ratnani etc for a day and promised people especially from South Mumbai of a nice photo of their inked finger if they vote.

9. A polling booth inside Café Leopald, Gokul and Toto’s Bandra at any given point in a day would have gathered at least half of Mumbai votes.

10. A rumor by EC that groups like AVICII, AKCENT etc are performing at every booth in the city could have brought more people to the booth.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mumbai.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/10-steps-election-commission-could-have-taken-to-ensure-more-voter-turnout-in-mumbai-5177,10 steps Election Commission could have taken to ensure more voter turnout in Mumbai,,1398417254.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-shazias-video-leak-jnu-launches-new-course-bachelors-of-good-communalism-5169,"New Delhi. With debate about communalism peaking after Shazia Ilmi’s leaked video, where she urges Muslims to turn communal and vote for their very own Arvind Kejriwal, JNU has decided to clear the confusion and launched a new course Bachelors of Good Communalism.

After many celebrities came out and claimed that there are also degrees of communalism like good and bad communalism with Shazia belonging to the former category as what she said was in good spirit and for betterment of a particular community, JNU thought it was imperative to settle the debate once and for all and announced this course.

Shazia Ilmi’s degree certifying her as a good and noble communal.

Earlier Delhi University had launched a similar course, B. Sc (Bachelors of Secularism) to produce world class seculars.

“There are lots of bad saffron communals roaming in the society today and trying to harm the communal fabric of the country. Few such bad communals bring bad name to entire communal community,” said JNU director a self confessed good communal at the course launch gathering.

Now students can choose any of the following types of specializations and become a certified good communal.

1. Honest Communalism: A person resorting to communalism and issuing statements to the effect, but with self proclaimed honest intentions. Shazia Ilmi has already been awarded degree for this, based on her performance in the video.

2. Secular Communalism: A type where minority religion is appeased and asked to vote collectively where as majority religion is ignored and divided on caste based lines for political gains. This course will be headed by Digvijay Singh with guest lectures from Nitish Kumar.

3. Opportunist Communalism: A type in which leaders of Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena etc excel; where communalism is practiced not by choice but under some political compulsions.

4. Selective Communalism: Communalism practiced towards all but one minority religion. Anti-sikh sentiments during Indira’s reign being the prime example of this branch of good communalism.

Besides this, JNU also intends to launch a course for bad communalism, if there is not much opposition. This course would have only 2 specializations, India first communalism (where interests of all countrymen take precedent over caste or religion based appeasement) and Development communalism (where development and growth is given priority than hiding behind the garb of secularism)

Meanwhile taking a cue from JNU, Mulayam Singh has decided to launch a course in UP, which will segregate rapists on the basis of good rapists and bad rapists.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/communalism.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-shazias-video-leak-jnu-launches-new-course-bachelors-of-good-communalism-5169,"After Shazia's video leak, JNU launches new course Bachelors of 'Good Communalism'",,1398252898.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/horror-film-conjuring-2-narendra-modi-becomes-the-scariest-movie-ever-5159,"Los Angeles. Nobody would have missed watching James Wan’s Conjuring. Right from the Annabelle doll to the witch at the home, and the hide-and-clap scene which had freaked us out and told us to run out of theater. Conjuring, released last year, was revered as “the scariest movie”.

But, hold your breath, for there is the second installment of Conjuring from the same director: “Conjuring 2: Narendra Modi” which is currently being marketed as “the scariest movie ever”.

Already released in the USA and with box office collection skyrocketing the roofs of the cinemas running this sequel of the movie, the horror element is however related to India. The makers of the movie did not reveal photos of Narendra Modi in posters; they did not mention it in any news release either or credited his name anywhere in the movie.

When contacted, one insider from the production house said, “We wanted to scare the audience with a surprise element. If we had put his photo in posters, Asians would have backed off without reading the movie title. That would have been a suicidal marketing.”

There are also plans to release the movie in 3D version, with Polarised 3D Modi glasses, to add horror value to the movie.

Our reporter managed to read reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritics. One famous critic named Azam Khan of Buffalo, NY gave 5/5 and said, “It is and will be the scariest movie ever seen in the world. I could not understand why the whites had not felt any horror. Some even yawned.”

Left: Scariest scene in Conjuring 2, Right: Expected reaction of Indian audience.

Twitter users were seen shrieking through their tweets. One Indian from UCLA named Karthik RB had tweeted, “Certainly the scariest scenes ever scene in the history of mankind. My worst nightmare came true #Conjuring2 #NoModi”

But the movie had also received mixed reviews from other quarters in America. A critic named Mark from Washington had reviewed as, “I can give 0.5/5. The Indian guy just walks here and there and stares at the screen silently. And a part of audience screams and jump off their seat. I’m still confused why Wan came up with such a sequel,” while many of the whites had left the theater dazed and confused about why browns are jumping and shouting in horror.

The plot of the movie is simple. Bekar Patel, the hero, moves along with his journalist friends and liberals into new home in Indian state of Gujarat. That home happens to be the neighbor of Modi’s. They do not see his presence at first, but when the antagonist Modi comes out for walk in terrace or for tending the garden, the kids and parents scream alike and gasp in the shadows.

The scariest part of movie is the scene wherein Modi stops and smiles at the family. They perform all sort of ceremonies and even go to the extent of roping Azam Khan’s buffaloes to ward off the evil. But nothing happens as per their wish. The movie ends with a trembling Patel leaving the house.

When contacted, Neil from NewLine Cinemas, who had produced and released the movie, said, “Our primary target for this movie is definitely not the usual ‘Muricans. We have developed this movie specifically to cash on the huge market of India-Middle east-Europe and Pakistan. Seculars are scared of Narendra Modi and 26% of the world population are Seculars. Moreover, Secularism is the fastest growing religion, which when projected economically, means that 1 in every 5 person will be buying this movie ticket to get the horror experience.”

“This movie when released internationally, which is this Friday, will be the top-grossing movie forever. Already, the Seculars and Modi-Hating Highly qualified Educated Intelligent What-Not Liberals in ‘Murica are watching this movie for 4-5 times to enjoy that horror emotion. That is why our movie got such huge opening despite non-cooperation from local whites here. We are also going to use NGOs to spread awareness about this movie,” he added.

Our foreign correspondent then approached James Wan, the director of the movie. When asked about the reason for choosing Narendra Modi, he sounded enthusiastic, “Actually, we thought of casting Modi himself. But, he does not have visa to come here. Also, he denied to act in our movie. That’s fascism! So, we took clips of Modi from ads and rallies and inserted it to make the scariest moments of the movie. Our guess went right. In one scene, we showed scariest ghost enter, and then Modi walks beside it. The audience who yawned at the ghost, suddenly sat upright and shrieked at their shrill voices for Modi. This will become the scariest movie in Indian subcontinent for sure. We are arranging to show the movie to Indian journalists first. I am sure they will enjoy the horror. Also, we are planning for an Indian release on May 17.”

There were reports about seculars having heart attacks and panic attacks while watching this movie. Many had tried to run away from theater. Certainly, this is going to be the “scariest movie ever”.

Meanwhile, there were reports from sources inside Warner Bros., that they are planning along with Constantin Films to produce another installment in the Resident Evil series. They are trying to rope in Sagarika Ghose to act in the lead role. The storyline is rumored to be Sagarika Ghose fighting off the Internet Hindus Zombies – Modi bhakts combo and the film has been currently titled as “Resident Evil: Internet Hindus”.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/modi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/horror-film-conjuring-2-narendra-modi-becomes-the-scariest-movie-ever-5159,Horror film “Conjuring 2: Narendra Modi” becomes the scariest movie ever,,1398248850.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a major embarrassment to the ruling Congress party, a party leader has accidentally sent a mail to journalists taking moral and full responsibility for the party’s defeat in the 2014 general elections.

“Rahul ji tried his best and Priyanka ji gave the last moment energy, but leaders like me needed to work harder on ground. I accept the full responsibility of the defeat,” the leader said in the mail.

The leaders who can’t fail

“But this electoral defeat will not defeat our spirits. Congress party is a thought, a soch, and as Rahul ji had said – yeh soch humaare dil mein hai – I solemnly swear to work for the betterment of the party under the leadership of Rahul ji and Priyanka ji and Sonia ji, and Vadra ji too,” the mail further read.

The party was clearly embarrassed with the mail that landed in many journalists’ inbox, but they quickly claimed that some “communal forces” had hacked the email account of the said leader and sent the mail.

“We are going to sweep the elections. Every leader and worker is confident that Congress alone will get 500 seats in this Lok Sabha. No leader can write such mail. This is the dirty tricks department of BJP at work,” party spokesman Sanju Jha told Faking News.

However, political experts claim that it could be a case of accidentally hitting the “send” button, and not any case of hacking.

“Since many opinion polls and analysts are predicting the worst defeat of Congress in these elections, there is a competition among the leaders to take the blame and shield Rahul Gandhi, thus getting in good books of the family,” an expert explained.

“I think this particular leader, and dozens others, must have composed a nice mail taking responsibility to be the first to impress the family. He might have clicked the ‘send’ button by mistake instead of clicking ‘save’ after adding Vadra to the list of leaders after yesterday’s defense of Vadra by Priyanka,” the expert claimed.

Many other experts too share the same view though they are not sure which will be the leader who could win this race.

“Or maybe Manmohan Singh could win the race again, pushed to the finishing line,” one of the experts opined.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gandhis.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-accidentally-sends-mail-taking-responsibility-for-defeat-in-elections-5167,Congress leader accidentally sends mail taking responsibility for defeat in elections,,1398243346.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Defending her husband Robert Vadra against land grabbing allegations, Priyanka Gandhi today blamed opposition for making false charges and said Robert was feeling very humiliated, as he was not mentally as strong as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has shown immense capability to put up all kinds of humiliations – whether from insiders or outsiders.

“The way opposition is treating my husband, it’s not fair at all. For god’s sake, he wears pink pants; such a soft-hearted private citizen he is!” said an upset Priyanka lashing out at BJP leaders.

Robert Vadra learning the art of getting humiliated and yet being chilled about it

“They are habituated of targeting Manmohan ji, so they think it’s okay to target my husband with such harsh words. But BJP should understand that everyone has their own capacity. So when it comes to humiliating, BJP can’t be so brazen in their attack on my husband,” Priyanka added further.

Political experts are not at all shocked at Priyanka’s comment, as she had earlier praised Manmohan Singh and had called him super PM.

“This shows why Priyanka Gandhi respects Manmohan Singh so much. She is highly impressed by Dr Singh’s quality of not minding being humiliated. In fact, entire Congress appreciates the Prime Minister for this quality, because of which he was rewarded with a second term. Many Congress leader look up to him as a source of inspiration, especially after Rahul Gandhi publicly called his cabinet’s decision a complete nonsense,” explained a well known political analyst working for a leading news channel.

“He is captain cool of the UPA government,” the analyst added.

Sources tell Faking News that a few days back, Priyanka Gandhi saw Robert Vadra sobbing and kicking the ground in middle of a football stadium sized land that he bought recently.

Vadra was perturbed because of BJP leader Uma Bharti’s threat of sending him to jail if Modi became the Prime Minister. Priyanka got emotional and upset seeing he husband so weak, and she immediately asked Manmohan Singh to console Vadra.

“It was that midnight, when Manmohan Singh taught him the first lesson of handling humiliation. Dr. Singh asked Robert vadra to say ‘Theek Hai’ whenever someone accuses him of anything,” revealed a source close to Gandhi family.

Party insiders say that Priyanka is mulling over the option of hiring Manmohan Singh as a full time personal trainer for Robert Vadra, once Dr. Singh retires from the post of Prime Minister next month.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VadraManmohan.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/priyanka-gandhi-planning-to-hire-manmohan-singh-to-teach-vadra-the-art-of-handling-humiliation-5161,Priyanka Gandhi planning to hire Manmohan Singh to teach Vadra the art of handling humiliation,,1398167754.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Priyanka Gandhi claimed that her family was being wrongly maligned by the BJP, Congress has congratulated Robert Vadra, a part of her family, for getting this clean chit from a Gandhi with the cleanest image.

“Hooda sir did his best. He kicked out Ashok Khemka and got a clean chit for Vadra, but the certificate by Priyanka ji is priceless,” a Congress leader from Haryana told Faking News.

Coming soon – a new and improved Vadra.

“Robert Vadra got lucky, again,” he added.

Party sources say that after Priyanka publicly defended Robert Vadra, Congress leaders were filled with new enthusiasm and energy to defend Vadra on his controversial land and real estate deals.

“When party leaders, many of them ministers in the government, had run to TV studios and journalists to defend Vadra, questions were raised as to why these people were feeling obliged to defend a private citizen. But now all the family loyalists feel vindicated,” a party source revealed.

Sources further reveal that there was some confusion among family loyalists after opposition spread rumors that Vadra could be suspended from the family to keep the image of the family clean, which has been the party’s mission and objective since India’s independence.

But now with Priyanka supporting her hubby with full force, the party has got the signal loud and clear that Vadra too was a clean, honest, secular, and progressive person, who should be written about in a favorable manner by historians and commentators.

“Congratulations sir, you are the epitome of honesty and a source of inspiration for every budding entrepreneur and small farmer in our country,” a congratulatory note delivered to Robert Vadra read.

Political experts say that the emotional family talk delivered by Priyanka Gandhi, which was different from the usual family stories told by Rahul Gandhi, signified a shift in Congress party leadership.

“This clearly shows that Priyanka is better at telling stories, and thus a better leader than her brother Rahul. This is a blow to Modi and Rahul both, but a damn good news for Vadra,” an expert claimed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vadra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-congratulates-robert-vadra-for-getting-clean-chit-from-priyanka-gandhi-5163,Congress congratulates Robert Vadra for getting a clean chit from Priyanka Gandhi,,1398165299.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Two days after courting controversy by saying that those opposing Narendra Modi would have to go to Pakistan after general elections, Giriraj Singh has issued another controversial statement.

The Bihar BJP leader has now declared that Pakistani players, who show public support and admiration for Narendra Modi, will definitely be included in the next season of IPL.

Pakistani players haven’t been part of IPL ever since 26/11 Mumbai attacks, even though Pakistani diplomats, actors, singers, journalists, gamblers, umpires, and commentators have been regularly visiting India, with many of them being integral part of the private T20 cricket league.

“Those who are supporting Modi ji are welcome to India, even if they are Pakistanis,” Giriraj Singh said at the risk of becoming “secular” in the eyes of his latest supporters and critics.

“Last time Pakistani players played in IPL, a Modi was in-charge. They can get a chance to play again as a Modi will be in-charge again!” Singh further added.

Giriraj Singh explaining his plan

However, the BJP Lok Sabha candidate from Nawada constituency later clarified that the offer was valid till 12th May only, when polling conclude. Any support expressed thereafter will not be considered for the IPL visa.

Experts believe that this is a plan by BJP to try and show international acceptability for Narendra Modi. A leading secular expert on the condition of anonymity told Faking News, “They are trying to use IPL money to lure these players and later they will claim international and minority support both. BJP is just trying to fool people with help of corporate money.”

As soon as the expert mentioned “corporate money”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) declared that they were opposed to Giriraj Singh’s and BJP’s plan to include Pakistani players in next edition of IPL.

“Our analysis says that Modi will add all the star Pakistani players in Mumbai Indians as he is controlled by Ambani. All the other IPL teams will lose out to Mumbai Indians if Modi becomes PM,” AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal exposed the devious plans of BJP.

Congress too has opposed Giriraj Singh’s move.

“Why is BJP ignoring Sri Lankan players who couldn’t play in Chennai last time and mostly went unsold this time? They are just talking about Pakistani players as BJP always indulges in minority appeasement,” Digvijay Singh claimed with a straight face.

While political parties were divided, the proposal has been welcomed by a lot of IPL viewers in India who are excited at the prospect of watching superstars from across the border.

However, many felt that Giriraj Singh needs to add that he will ban Ramiz Raja from commentary after government formation to get greater support from IPL fans.

Pakistani cricketers have not reacted to this offer as yet as they calculate the potential earnings from an IPL contract vis a vis the risk they face in their home country if they publicly support Modi.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/giriraj-singh.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pakistani-players-who-praise-narendra-modi-will-be-included-in-ipl-8-giriraj-singh-5153,Pakistani players who praise Narendra Modi will be included in IPL-8: Giriraj Singh,,1398092885.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With people threatening to leave India or getting threatened of being deported to Pakistan if Narendra Modi came to power, Bangladeshis are eying this potential empty space.

Sources tell that People in Bangladesh have been expressing their happiness by bursting crackers after each voluntary announcement of leaving India or threat of deportation to Pakistan.

Crowd in Dhaka shouting ‘Abki baar Modi sarkar’.

“We are not going to snatch something, we are just migrating to fill the empty space, just like air and liquid flow into empty space. Earlier when we used to infiltrate, there was a guilt feeling, but now it’s fair and justified,” said a Bangladeshi while talking to Faking News, “If Indians think that we Bangladeshis don’t care for India, they are wrong. We do care for India, it’s like our own home.”

Excited by the prospects of Modi coming to power, many people in Bangladesh and Bangladeshis living in India have started rooting for Narendra Modi in 2014 general elections.

“Initially, we were not in mood to vote for Modi. But ever since people started promising to leave India if Modi becomes PM and thereby help in reducing country’s population, we changed our mind,” explained Abdul Gafoor, a Bangladeshi living in Assam.

“In my village, a couple of such people are there who had decided to infiltrate into Bhutan, but now they are hopeful of coming to India. I will invite them,” Gafoor revealed his future plan, amidst chant of ‘Abki bar Modi sarkar‘ by his fellow family members.

“Modi surely means hope,” he added.

But unlike Gafoor, many Bangladeshis living in India are not coming out openly in support of Modi, as they are expected to show their political loyalty to so called secular parties. “If we say it openly, most probably they will send us back to Bangladesh,” feared one Bangladeshi Modi supporter.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/success-of-2-states-prompts-political-parties-to-recreate-their-own-version-of-the-movie-5143,"2 States is the story of a Punjabi boy Arjun Kapoor and a Tamil girl Alia Bhatt studying at IIM Ahmedabad who fall in love and want to get married. Families oppose the inter-caste union. Eventually everyone agrees and they live happily ever after. That’s all.

Arjun and Alia, about to become mascots of Lok Sabha elections 2014.

Seeing how popular the movie has become this election season, all political parties decided to cash in on the popularity by releasing their own versions:

BJP: The story remains exactly the same. In the last scene all characters thank Modi for the infrastructure of Ahmedabad which contributed to them falling in love & marrying each other. BJP claims helping young couples to get together in top colleges is part of Modi’s “Gujarat model of development”. ‘The End’ is replaced by ‘Abki baar…’.

2) Congress: The boy is Hindu Punjabi and Girl is Tamil Muslim. The first half wherein they fall in love remains same. Then the opposition of the families turns violent wherein rioters from Punjab and Tamil Nadu join in and create havoc in Ahmedabad. Lots of people die, hence proved Modi is a divisive & fascist leader. Sanjay Jha and Manish Tewari scream their lungs out on Newshour. Teesta Setalvad gets the girl’s mother to contest elections from Ahmedabad on a Congress ticket empowered by Rahul Gandhi.

3) Aam Aadmi Party: The boy and girl fall in love. They waste so much time in romance and drama that they actually forget to study. Consequently, they don’t score well and remain unemployed after graduation. They protest outside IIM-A and Kejriwal joins them. He calls IIM-A an Adani agent and points at the unemployment of the couple to show the Gujarat growth model as a failure. He assures 7.00% free marks to all students whose score is below 40%. He is made dean of IIM A, but quits in 49 days because there is another love story in BHU Varanasi that gains his attention.

4) Samajwadi Party:The boy and girl fall in love and have premarital sex. Azam Khan & Abu Azmi issue statements that the couple must be killed for this blasphemy. The parents oblige. End of Story.

5) Telugu Desam, Jagan Reddy’s YSRCP and TRS: There is no love story, IIM or Ahmedabad in the movie. ‘2 States’ turns out to be a documentary on the respective party’s stand on the creation of the ‘2 states’ of Telangana and Seemandhra.

6) MNS and Shiv Sena: The north indian boy celebrates valentines day with the south indian girl in public. We all know what happens next.

7) JDU: The original movie is run in highlights for few minutes. Then Nitish Kumar shows up on-screen saying this is bias towards Modi and asks why there are no IIMs in Bihar for such stories to happen. He demands special status for Bihar with atleast 3 IIMs.

8) Left Front and Trinamool Congress: They make a joint movie wherein one party roots for the girl’s side and one for the boy’s side. They keep protesting against each other and as a result the college is closed for 4 days a week (excluding weekends) for the entire year. Nobody comes to campus to hire and everyone passes free time by writing poems and having in-house debates. IIM-A is subsequently renamed IIM-C.

Sensing that no one was ready to believe that Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh had given over 1000 speeches in the last 10 years, PMO has decided to remix those speeches into music tracks and release the speeches as Music Album.

“Oh, please, don’t crack such jokes,” Pankaj Pachauri, the media adviser to the Prime Minister said when this reporter asked if the album would be a blank CD.

Pachauri said that he was confident that the CD will sell as hot cakes and youngsters will finally hear what their Prime Minister has been telling them all these years.

When asked why the speeches were being released in form of a music album, when they could have been released as a book too, Pachauri said, “We don’t like books.”

Dr. Singh taking some rest between two songs/speeches

Sources say that this sudden dislike for books by the PMO, even though the Prime Minister is a scholarly person, is due to the fact that recently two books were released that painted the Prime Minister unfavorably.

However, Pachauri didn’t get into details of any book, and instead claimed that music was the best way to reach out to the youngsters.

“This was being thought ever since Priyanka Chopra launched her music album,” Pachauri claimed.

Sources tell Faking News that Dr. Singh’s music album will begin with “Tere bin nahin lagda dil mera soniya“, which is the speech delivered by Dr. Manmohan Singh during Sonia Gandhi’s visits to USA.

Another song/speech “Chhup chhup ke chori pe chori” could apparently feature A Raja or Robert Vadra, while another speech, delivered during the coal block allotment, has been converted to the song “Hum se ka bhool hui jo ye saza humka mili“.

No further details of other thousands of speeches could be extracted from our sources.

While the album is slated to be released this Sunday, many music critics have already given 5 out of 5 stars to the album.

Experts believe that finally Congress has found the real game changer.

“2009 elections were won primarily due to the personal goodwill and clean image Dr. Manmohan Singh commanded. This album could make him relevant and lovable again,” an expert explained.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/manmohan.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pmo-to-release-1000-speeches-by-manmohan-singh-as-a-music-album-5131,PMO to release 1000 speeches by Manmohan Singh as a Music Album,,1397828810.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After his callous remarks on rape, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has once again courted controversy by saying that it was unfair to award death penalty to terrorists for their ‘mistakes’.

Addressing a rally at Mainpuri yesterday, Mulayam promised his core voter base that there would be changes in the tough anti-terrorism laws if his party came to power after the 2014 general elections. He also thanked Congress for removing POTA immediately after their government came to power in 2004 but said more needed to be done to make the laws more lenient for healthy terrorism to flourish in India.

“Don’t be so harsh on these innocent terrorists,” he pleaded.

Referring to the capital punishment meted out by Indian judiciary to Ajmal Kasab, Afzal Guru etc who Mulayam thought were only small time offenders, he said,“Pakistani, Pakistani hain..galti ho jaati hai (Pakistanis will be Pakistanis, they commit mistakes).”

The man whose dream of being a PM can at best be compared with Suresh Raina’s dream of hitting six of a short ball further explained, “Terrorists first infiltrate and befriend locals. When they playfully attack locals in friendship, citizens cry terror terror. We will revoke such harsh laws and will instead punish people or soldiers who misuse the laws by filing frivolous complaints.”

Azam Khan who was also present at the rally and was quite so far, started thunderously applauding Mulayam after he hinted punishing soldiers.

The former CM of Uttar Pradesh denied he was playing vote bank politics and defended terrorists by giving them a benefit of doubt in cases of Bomb Blasts. “When we burst crackers like gola bomb in India nobody raises a finger, but when they indulge in celebrations, we cry foul. This hypocrisy needs to end and people should be more careful to ensure when such celebrations are on they are not outside.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MULAYAM.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/addressing-a-new-rally-mulayam-singh-now-comes-out-in-defense-of-terrorists-says-mistakes-by-neighbors-happen-sometime-5127,"Addressing a new rally, Mulayam Singh now comes out in defense of terrorists, says mistakes by neighbors happen sometime",,1397803894.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Delighted with the stand taken by some people from Hindi film industry against BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, India’s Most wanted criminal Dawood Ibrahim has decided to increase his funding of Hindi Films.

The Pakistan based underworld don took this decision after he came to know about the petition by the Bollywood men and women, where secularism was called totally non-negotiable entity unlike corruption, plagiarism, underworld connection, extortion, black money, casting couch etc.

The petition has been signed by the forgotten people of who’s who of Bollywood. Well known filmmakers and signatories to the petition, Mahesh Bhatt or Imitiaz Ali vehemently denied that it was a publicity stunt. They further claimed that all of them were apolitical and much should be read into them liking Fan pages of Congress or AAP on Facebook.

“This time I felt compelled to come out and speak my mind,” said Bhatt who has now spoken and expressed his opinions on all kind of compelling incidents in his and others’ lives.

Dawood getting a tad bit emotional.

Sources tell Faking News that Dawood was particularly impressed and touched with Anand Patwardhan who vociferously defended 1993 Mumbai riots and serial bomb blasts (of which Dawood is prime accused) and called it an outcome of Babri Masjid demolition on Times Now’s Newshour yesterday.

Dawood felt that the industry, which is defending him, needed him at the time when it was under attack from communal fascist forces.

The don who had moved on to Cricket, IPL, and other exciting arenas such as Pakistani economy, will now return to financing Bollywood movies with immediate effect.

“Dawood bhai is so moved by the move that he will even risk funding movies starring Aftab Shivdasani, Mimoh Chakraborty, and will not mind even if he ends up making loses,” a close aide of Dawood told Faking News.

The Bollywood community, which had disappeared like Harman Baweja after Love Story 2050, when Kamal Hassan, one from their own fraternity, was being harassed and pressurized by extremist groups to take off Vishwaroopam from cinema halls, has welcomed Dawood’s gesture and heaped praises on him for showing such generosity.

While campaigning for Gul Panag, the AAP candidate from the ‘city beautiful’, Raghu of Roadies fame promised 50% reservation for people of Chandigarh, if they voted the rookie party to power.

With this announcement, Aam Aadmi Party has seemingly captured the mood of the local youth, and considering the craze for the reality show among the city’s youngsters, Gul Panag is being seen as a clear winner from the constituency.

“I am what I am”

“I always felt that Chandigarh has the capacity to provide many more Roadies than we usually select from here. 50% reservation will ensure that we select almost all the deserving candidates, instead of being forced to select just 3-4 people,” said Raghu while addressing a gathering comprising of aspiring Roadies and media men.

Raghu’s lofty promise targeting the first time voters has led to celebrations across the whole city.

“Now I am going to vote for AAP, nobody can stop me. I will even convince my family members to vote for AAP, I am sure they will agree, after all it’s about my career!” said Balwinder Singh, a final year engineering student.

“Roadies, I am coming, Raghu I am coming, Ranvijay I am coming. I am what I am, #@$%#%%,” Balwinder finished talking on a high note.

Raghu’s declaration has not only struck a chord with the first time voters, but has also provided some respite to many others who have been trying to get into Roadies for years.

Rohit Sharma, a man in his early 30s has been trying to get selected for Roadies since season one.

“Raghu sir’s promise is like the last ray of hope for me and many others like me. My hair is turning grey, but still I haven’t got an opportunity to showcase my talent of abusing and shouting loud,” teary eyed Rohit described his pain. Rohit feels that reservation in Roadies was necessary for social upliftment of people like him.

Meanwhile sensing a business opportunity, a couple of ex-Roadies have even started a coaching class to teach people, how to clear Roadies’ form filling, group discussion, and personal interview.

Energized by the public response, Chandigarh AAP has created a separate team to educate these young Roadies fans about voting process to ensure that the excitement is translated into votes.

“It is basically for those hardcore Roadies fans who believe that you need to vote for the opposition to vote them out. It’s just a precautionary measure to make sure that they don’t press the BJP’s symbol to vote out Kirron Kher,” revealed an AAP volunteer.

While trying to kill a mosquito sitting on his cheek, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal accidentally ended up slapping himself. However, the sight of Kejriwal being slapped angered his supporters so much that they ended up attacking the assaulter i.e. Kejriwal himself.

Sources tell Faking News that the AAP supremo was constantly urging his supporters to calm down, but the emotionally charged up supporters didn’t listen to their leader.

Kejriwal’s close aides taking him away from the angry supporters.

“We won’t let anybody hit Kejriwal sir, even if it is Kejriwal sir. We will teach a lesson to anyone daring to intimidate our leader,” said a furious AAP supporter when asked about the reason why he attacked his own party leader.

AAP supporters cooled down only after Kejriwal cleared the doubt and revealed that it was a mosquito that he was trying to kill, and that there was no intention of hurting himself.

Kejriwal further blamed BJP to clam down his supporters.

“What I felt from my short interaction with that mosquito that it was trained. I think BJP and Ambani are behind it. Considering the amount of money they have, they can do anything,” the former CM of Delhi lashed out at the saffron party.

“Those who have hatched this plan knew that my supporters were going to attack me if I accidentally slap myself. They capitalized on the anger of the AAP supporters and tried to disturb internal peace of my party,” Kejriwal exposed the devious plans.

While the AAP chief was successful in calming down the supporters, he was shocked to see such reaction from them. Sources say that the party is thinking of organizing anger management classes at their office in Delhi.

Meanwhile the allegedly “paid mosquito” is still at large and AAP members are searching it in the streets of Delhi.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has declared “Secularism”, speculated to be worth 20 crore votes, as an asset while filing nomination papers for the general elections from her constituency Raebareli.

In the affidavit giving details of assets owned by her, she mentioned it as an immovable property, which she inherited from her in-laws.

Secularly rich family.

“Yes, it’s indeed an asset for my mother and subsequently an asset for Congress too. My grandmother, my father, my mother, me, and my party have worked really hard to earn it and we are very proud of it,” said Rahul Gandhi who was accompanying Mrs. Gandhi at the district collectorate.

It’s being seen as an attempt by the grand old party to pass a strong message among the minorities of India.

“Look, how much she cares about secularism that she is putting it on the same level as that of money, gold, and real estate. It’s hard to find someone with such a love for secularism,” explained a senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh highlighting Mrs. Gandhi’s level of commitment toward the cause.

To gain a deep insight into how secular affluence is going to help Sonia Gandhi in the upcoming general elections, Faking News talked to famous election analyst Chunavi Chaudhary.

“In the current electoral market, it’s one of the hottest commodity that politicians are trading in. It has power to get you political allies. All you need to do is to keep it close to you, that’s all and it pays high dividend during elections,” described Chunavi Chaudhary.

“Secularism has been a very important asset for Congress and it has helped the party on numerous occasions. And as Sonia Gandhi is trying to get her property certified by Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari, it’s value is going to skyrocket for sure,” Mr Chaudhary added further.

Reportedly, Sonia Gandhi has even loaned a bit of secularism to Lalu Yadav, Congress political ally in Bihar. However, Lalu downplayed the claims. “Are budbak, ulta I have given her loan,” Lalu claimed

After critics attacked Modi over his false developmental claims and proved how backward Gujarat is, Gujarat government has decided to demand special category state status from the central government.

Gujarat government hopes that the special category status – usually given to underdeveloped states with governments that are supporting the central government – will help Gujarat overcome its backwardness.

A posh area of Ahmedabad.

This decision of Gujarat government comes as a huge surprise to critics of Narendra Modi who have exposed him incessantly on his developmental claims.

Later, our paid reporter investigated why Gujarat government has taken such a drastic step and also talked to various critics of Modi.

On being asked about the surprising move, chief secretary(Government of Gujarat) explained, “After allegations by Arvind Kejriwal and opposition leaders about the developmental claims of Gujarat being false, we investigated the allegations and found them to be true. Gujarat has no development in last 10 years. In fact, on a closer study we found that Gujarat’s economy has actually deteriorated in the last decade.”

“On realizing that Gujarat developmental model has failed, we started looking for alternative developmental models. Then we came across Bihar Model and found it the best. Following the model we’ve also demanded special category status from center,” he added further.

Our reporter then approached critics of Modi to seek their response. On being asked to comment Arvind Kejriwal, who visited Gujarat few days ago to verify development of Gujarat but found none, said, “Modi is lying. Next week I’ll go to Gujarat to verify backwardness claims of Modi government.”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh lashed out at Modi over the move, “Modi has done nothing to impoverish Gujarat, its the hardlyworking population of Gujarat which has achieved underdevelopment, besides Gujarat has a history of underdevelopment going back to centuries.”

Modi’s Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar didn’t take kindly to this development, he is reported to have said that Gujarat underdevelopment is a hype and it was Bihar that was more underdeveloped and deserves special category status.

Addressing a public gathering in the capital, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has promised to build a pipeline between Earth and gas giant Jupiter, if his party is voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections.

Jupiter, one of the four gas planets beside Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, is composed primarily of Hydrogen, which is often considered as fuel of the future.

Simple, elegant and visionary plan.

“We are determined to fix the gas problem which our country is facing. Construction of a pipeline between Earth and Jupiter is going to free us from the claws of gas exploration companies,” declared Kejriwal amidst chanting of ‘Jupiter zindabad’ by excited AAP supporters.

“It’s just a one time cost, after that there will be nothing but gas; I mean we will distribute gas free of cost,” added Kejriwal.

“Each household will be having a direct connection from the main pipeline, people will be having freedom to use it as they wish,” he explained the benefits of AAP government.

The rookie party has included building of gas pipeline in their manifesto. After consuming whole of Jupiter, their plan is to add few extra hundred million miles of pipe to the existing system and then start consuming Saturn.

AAP bashed gas exploration companies like Reliance Industries and Chevron Corporation of intentionally avoiding Jupiter as source of gas. “The sheer abundance of gas is going to bring down the gas price, that’s why they are afraid of exploring Jupiter. It’s a big conspiracy,” claimed another AAP leader.

Kejriwal also blamed his political rival Modi of being hand in gloves with Ambani to keep Jupiter’s gas potential out of election agenda.

“Modi never talked about Jupiter. AAP is the only party which has courage to raise this issue, this is real pro-development attitude and foresightedness,” claimed Kejriwal lashing out at Modi.

However, on being asked how they are going to build such long pipeline, Kejriwal said, “Desh ka aam aadmi jag chuka hai, so please, don’t underestimate the power of a common man.”

Meanwhile, Congress has accused AAP of hijacking his Rahul Gandhi’s Jupiter’s agenda. “It was Rahul ji who first brought Jupiter into picture and AAP is capitalizing on that,” Congress leader Salman Khurshid said while attacking AAP.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EarthJupiter.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-promises-to-build-a-pipeline-between-gas-planet-jupiter-and-earth-if-voted-to-power-5010,"Kejriwal promises to build a pipeline between gas planet Jupiter and Earth, if voted to power",,1396432239.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kejriwal’s deafening silence caught media attention after no verbal attacks on BJP, Congress, Ambani, and Adani by him were recorded since this morning.

Trying to keep his mouth shut.

When asked about the reason of this surprising silence, Kejriwal clarified, “No matter what you say, people don’t take you seriously on 1st of April. So better not to make such sensitive allegations on 1st April, as people might confuse it as some prank.”

“For today, all politicians are honest, no media is paid, and I am an idiot. It’s one of those rare days when sun rose from the west,” quipped Kejriwal.

However, sources reveal that it all started last midnight when Kejriwal, while having a chat with his close aide, reiterated his famous dialogue, ‘Sab mile huye hain’, following which his aide started laughing as he was reading April Fools’ Day jokes on Twitter at the same time.

It was then Kejriwal decided to keep his mouth shut for the whole day.

As per political experts, it’s a much required break which Kejriwal needed to maintain his high spirits. “He has been playing this blame game recklessly for last few months. This break is going to detoxicate him,” explained a political analyst.

This is the first day since Kejriwal formed his party when he will be spending 24 hours without calling rival politicians and big businessmen corrupt and thief.

Even Kejriwal accept the fact that, it’s not going to be easy for him to pass a whole day just like a normal person. “It’s like navrata fasting and I am really not habituated to this,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,"Bangalore. In order to attract unemployed engineers of the city, Congress candidate from Bangalore South, Nandan Nilekani has promised a scheme similar to MGNREGA.

“Rajiv Gandhi National Technology Employment Guarantee Act (RGNTEGA) will ensure at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to all the unemployed software engineers of Bangalore,” said Nilekani while announcing his second most ambitious project after Aadhaar Card.

“I know them, now they are going to vote for me.”

“It’s not a new thing for me, as even when I was in Infosys, we used to do bulk hiring from engineering colleges. It was the same work, but in corporate style,” Nilekani added further, highlighting his past work experience of handling such projects.

When asked about possible danger of RGNTEGA meeting the same fate as that of Aadhaar Card scheme, Nilekani rejected the apprehension and said that the presence of ‘Rajiv Gandhi’ in project name is sufficient enough for its success.

As per sources close to Nilekani, most of the engineers getting employment through RGNTEGA would be working on a dream web project of Rahul Gandhi.

“Rahul wants to empower Indians by creating a website with combined features of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, IRCTC, YouTube, Wikipedia and LinkedIn,” a Congress insider revealed to Faking News.

“When it comes to being a visionary, his imagination knows no boundaries,” the insider explained.

Considering huge population of jobless engineers in Bangalore, Nilekani’s move is being seen as a masterstroke.

Even the punchline of the scheme, ‘Har ungli shakti, har ungli tarakki‘, which reportedly was coined by Congress VP Rahul Gandhi, is quite apt and going viral among the jobless IT crowd.

Although many of the jobless engineers are happy with the news, they are also expecting ‘bench’ culture during their employment period under RGNTEGA.

“Job and all are fine, but for a proper work life balance, a minimum 20 days of bench warming would be good enough,” said a 2010 engineering pass out. With elections round the corner, it’s highly probable that Nilekani would agree to engineers’ demand.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Nandan-Nilekani.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,Nandan Nilekani promises scheme like NREGA for unemployed engineers of Bangalore,,1396273152.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The people who attended the gathering were astounded by the intense silence of the Prime Minister and started meditating. Few claim to be enlightened.

Golden silence

A local school teacher, who spoke to our correspondent said, “A subject on our Prime Minister’s silence should be inducted into our curriculum to ensure that students are silent in class.”

The school teacher also remarked that he will tweet Dr. Shashi Tharoor about it. Another local who was awed by the speech silence, remarked, “He sounded just like James Bond when he said his last and only two words: Theek Hai!”

Among those inspired were three engineering students – Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. They have decided to improve the country’s economic situation by extracting gold from the Prime Minister’s silence. The students told Faking News, “We want to prove that Silence is indeed golden.”

The rally came to an end when a cop, ACP Jai Dixit broke the silence and questioned the Prime Minister as to why he hasn’t been promoted since 2004.

The supercop had recently helped the Chicago Police Department in catching a criminal and his autistic twin, and yet did not get a promotion. Apparently, this is when the Prime minister said Theek Hai and concluded the meditation camp rally.

Home Minister Mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde later issued a statement saying, “ACP Jai Dixit is getting promotions without his Knowledge.”

Meanwhile this radical approach of campaigning has garnered a lot of interest. Congress spokesman Jha praised the leadership of the party for this innovation. “This is a huge success of Rahul baba’s policies. Now we know he is not only an expert in tearing and throwing policies but also an expert in making them,” claimed Jha.

But members of the opposing parties have claimed that the Prime Minister’s rally was nonsense. Mr.Rahul Gandhi, who was visibly infuriated by the comments, came in support of his Prime Minister and a made a statement saying, “This is outrageous. Only I can say nonsense when it comes to our Prime Minister. Who do they think they are?”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-exposes-dettols-claim-of-100-protection-4986,"New Delhi. In a developing story, Arvind Kejriwal of AAP has come down heavily of the manufacturer of Dettol brand of products Reckitt Benckiser for claiming “100% protection” from germs.

In a hurriedly called press conference, which was attended by half of his own media men turned AAP members, he declared, “There is no 100% safety as proclaimed by Dettol model of cleanliness by a crony capitalist company like Reckitt Benckiser.”

Exposed!!

He also alleged that his research team has shown that Reckitt Benckiser is actually owned by Ambani and Adani through a highly sophisticated maze of share holdings and cross-investments, and that the entire idea behind this “propaganda” in “paid media” was done by Narendra Modi to ensure that Ambani and Adani, via their crony company Reckitt Benckiser, would be able to spread this false assurance in the rest of India that Dettol is 100% safe.

He further claimed that he has personally examined his hands after being washed by Dettol Hand Wash and found 0.01 % of germs still remaining. When counter questioned by an attending journalist that this proved that 99.99% of the germs were indeed killed, he thundered back accusing the journalist of being “paid” and said, “aap sab bike hue hai. All of you are paid. What about 0.01% germs ? Where is the cleanliness, hygiene and safety as promised by Dettol? If you cannot remove even 0.01 % of germs, how can you claim to clean the entire country?”

The journalist who asked the question was left wondering if he should work for free from now onward to avoid being labelled “paid” by all and sundry.

When asked why he was not saying anything about what had caused the 99.99% of the germs on his hands, in the first place, he did not give a straight answer. He only said, “Please provide evidence that my hands are in a mess because of the filth created in this country governed by Congress for more than 60 years out of 67 years and I will arrest the germ causing agent in less than 3 hours.”

“Main bahut chotta aadmi hun, meri koi auqaat nahi hai, lekin main is desh ki hygiene habits badalne aya hun. I will ensure that when my government comes to power, I will remove 100% of the germs by bringing in my own version of ‘GermThokPal’ bill. Is desh ka aam admi ab jaag gaya hai and he will not tolerate even 0.01% of the germs,” he went on to add.

The press conference ended on a happy note when some AAP members showered each other with black ink, and then promptly proceeded to wash the ink stains off with Dettol.

Punya Prasoon Bajpai termed the press conference as “Krantikari, bahut krantikari.“

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"New Delhi. In a shocking move, BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi has decided to opt out from the race of country’s top job. Experts say that he peaked too early and felt symptoms of fatigue, ending in voluntary withdrawal from the race.

Totally confused about what to do and not willing to go back to LK Adavni, BJP announced that Coder Singh, a 33-year-old person with no political experience, was their new PM candidate. Coder Singh is an ex-software engineer with 5 years of development experience in .NET, a Microsoft developed framework.

Communal Code

But despite his blank political background, he is being called a communal, controversial, divisive, and a threat to the “idea of India” by the same people who earlier claimed that they were opposed to Modi only, and not BJP per se.

“Hinduism, I mean, Hindu nationalism is a threat to this country and Coder’s mind must be decoded. I think he is dangerous to our pluralistic society,” Panchsheel Tripathi, a London based liberal tweeted within two minutes of BJP announcing its new candidate.

Not only alleged intellectuals, but political opponents too announced that they will not let Coder get success in capturing Delhi.

Soon after the announcement, UPA cabinet passed an ordinance to bring software codes written in private companies under RTI. Reportedly, they did so to dig into Coder’s past work. They hired some top class software engineers, not under eNREGA scheme that is used to hire only low class trolls but under professional contracts, to scrutinize the codes written by Coder Singh.

Apparently the hired software engineers could find some bug, which led Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to launch a scathing attack on Coder Singh. She immediately called him “Bug ka Saudagar” and her fellow party members made serious allegations about his past.

“We found ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in one of the comments that he added in his code block while working for a software company in 2012. This is the new face of Internet Hindus and right-wing ideology,” claimed Digvijay Singh showing a snippet of the code as proof.

However, Coder Singh himself is very proud of his coding past. He even showed a bug-free application that he developed while working with one of the companies.

“It has been given clean chit by testers of that company, it’s totally bug free and many have praised my codes for being as beautiful as poetry,” the new PM candidate of BJP told Faking News.

However claims of being bug free was rejected by AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who raised question marks over the quality of application developed by Coder Singh.

“Who are these testers, sab mile huye hain ji. I have tested it rigorously for 2 days, it’s flawed and buggy,” claimed Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference.

On being asked about specific details of the bugs, he warned media to not doubt his testing skills. “Although I have no development experience, but I am a born tester,” he said.

Kejriwal even slammed Coder Singh for working on Microsoft Technologies.

“Why he didn’t use open source frameworks? Why he preferred C# over PHP? He is hand in gloves with tech goon Microsoft. If he comes to power, he is going to promote Bill Gates agenda and all open source coders will die without job,” Kejriwal claimed.

Latest reports suggest that BJP is planning to drop Coder Singh as PM candidate and look for a candidate that will be accepted by people who would anyway never vote for the party.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommunalCode-300x151.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"Modi opts out of PM race, BJP puts up an ex-software engineer as new candidate",,1396009520.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,"New Delhi. In a blow to Rahul Gandhi’s dreams of an India full of rights, the left-handed community has come out strongly against the recent spate of ‘Right to xyz’ bills proposed by the Congress.

“Congress claims to work for minorities, but why is it ignoring the handedness minority?” asked an angry Vaman, President of All India Left-handers’ Association, who works with the MNC Bayer.

When explained that the names of the bills have possibly misled him, he retorted, “Oh yeah?Next you will tell me that the name ‘Indian Premier League’ is misleading and it is held in UAE… Oh wait…”

One of the protesters

“But there is no confusion,” he quickly added, “If there could be a ‘Right to Entrepreneurship’ in the party manifesto, why not ‘Right to Left handed writing’ too? I mean, both of these make equal sense.”

“Or the best would be if they change their symbol from right hand to left hand,” he demanded.

But lefties are not the only one to object to the move; the moment Congress’s new manifesto was announced, Leftist parties vociferously opposed what they referred to as ‘poisonous rightist policies’. Later the high-level think-tanks of these parties opined that these policies were, in fact, leftist, and hence the opposition was hastily withdrawn and underplayed.

When asked by this reporter if the bills were against lefties, a Congressman emphatically said, “Rahul Gandhi will tell you the importance of the bills.” When asked about the whereabouts of Rahul Gandhi, he revealed that it was Rahul Gandhi himself speaking.

He then continued, “You people laugh at me when I answer every question by saying that we passed the Right to Information Act. Now I will pass so many ‘Right to fill-in-the-blanks’ bills that I can answer any question you ask. So next time you ask me if I’m afraid of losing to Narendra Modi, I will tell you that we passed the Right to be Unafraid of Narendra Modi Act. Genius, no?”

When further pressed on the actual contents of these bills, Rahul Gandhi said that they will empower women, and after pausing for effect, added, “Both right-handed AND left-handed.”

AAP workers’ reactions were even more scathing.

“The bills are a right-wing conspiracy,” a junior worker holding a broom in his left hand said, “thus proving that the Congress and BJP are one and the same.”

A BJP party worker blamed it all on Sonia Gandhi. “There is clearly a foreign right hand behind the bills.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/left-handed-products.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,Left-handed community gets offended by Congress’ spate of ‘Right to’ bills,,1395996280.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-introduce-inkpal-bill-that-will-ban-ink-and-fountain-pens-if-voted-to-power-4971,"Varanasi. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced today at a rally that if voted to power, AAP will introduce an Inkpal bill that will have provisions to ban manufacture, sale, and possession of all kinds of ink and fountain pens. This comes in the wake of a sharp upswing in the number of incidents involving ink throwing at politicians.

The move has been supported by all political parties and thus, the Inkpal bill is expected to be passed easily in the Parliament. As per the Inkpal bill, possession of ink of any color will be punishable under POTA as well as under section 302 of the IPC.

Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has always been on the hit list of ink throwing wannabe patriots, has demanded that the fountain pen be classified under ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’ and that all leading corrupt nations should come forward and sign a treaty ratifying this.

“Ink throwing is a black mark on Indian democracy, and Rahul Baba always hated ink, pens anyway,” muttered the Congress leader before putting on his helmet back to avoid being inked.

The attack that led AAP leaders to demand Inkpal Bill.

AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha too has voiced her support saying she was anguished at the very thought of someone smudging her precious silk sarees with black ink.

The RSS has however opposed this move, saying that an exception should be made for Saffron ink. Similar views have been echoed by the IUML which said that the proposal to ban Green colored ink was a conspiracy against the minority community by Narendra Modi. Noticeably, right wing leader Pramod Mutalik has maintained a studied silence on this issue.

However, economists have cautioned against any hasty moves to ban ink as it could have major ramifications on the economy.

“With so many corrupt and irritating politicians around, many small scale ink factories have come up to fulfill the demand for black ink, they will have nowhere to go if the Inkpal bill becomes a reality,” said leading economist Swami S Inklesariya Iyer.

Economists have further warned that such a move could also affect bilateral trade relations with our neighbors. Pakistan, which is a major manufacturer and supplier of counterfeit ink, has threatened to take this issue to the WTO, UN, and the UNHRC.

Rubber Stamp Dealers Association (RSDA) secretary Manhoman Singh too lamented the move and pointed out that it will lead to loss of jobs. “How do they expect good quality rubber stamps without any ink?” he asked in agony.

The Indian Dental Association has vowed to protest against the proposed Inkpal bill, tooth and nail. Our sources say that dentists around India were making a killing with so many politicians with black ink stains turning up for a flossing and cleaning session. Although with most of India’s politicians being over 85 and having lost their dentures long ago, this argument doesn’t hold much water.

While campaigning for Gul Panag, the AAP candidate from the ‘city beautiful’, Raghu of Roadies fame promised 50% reservation for people of Chandigarh, if they voted the rookie party to power.

With this announcement, Aam Aadmi Party has seemingly captured the mood of the local youth, and considering the craze for the reality show among the city’s youngsters, Gul Panag is being seen as a clear winner from the constituency.

“I am what I am”

“I always felt that Chandigarh has the capacity to provide many more Roadies than we usually select from here. 50% reservation will ensure that we select almost all the deserving candidates, instead of being forced to select just 3-4 people,” said Raghu while addressing a gathering comprising of aspiring Roadies and media men.

Raghu’s lofty promise targeting the first time voters has led to celebrations across the whole city.

“Now I am going to vote for AAP, nobody can stop me. I will even convince my family members to vote for AAP, I am sure they will agree, after all it’s about my career!” said Balwinder Singh, a final year engineering student.

“Roadies, I am coming, Raghu I am coming, Ranvijay I am coming. I am what I am, #@$%#%%,” Balwinder finished talking on a high note.

Raghu’s declaration has not only struck a chord with the first time voters, but has also provided some respite to many others who have been trying to get into Roadies for years.

Rohit Sharma, a man in his early 30s has been trying to get selected for Roadies since season one.

“Raghu sir’s promise is like the last ray of hope for me and many others like me. My hair is turning grey, but still I haven’t got an opportunity to showcase my talent of abusing and shouting loud,” teary eyed Rohit described his pain. Rohit feels that reservation in Roadies was necessary for social upliftment of people like him.

Meanwhile sensing a business opportunity, a couple of ex-Roadies have even started a coaching class to teach people, how to clear Roadies’ form filling, group discussion, and personal interview.

Energized by the public response, Chandigarh AAP has created a separate team to educate these young Roadies fans about voting process to ensure that the excitement is translated into votes.

“It is basically for those hardcore Roadies fans who believe that you need to vote for the opposition to vote them out. It’s just a precautionary measure to make sure that they don’t press the BJP’s symbol to vote out Kirron Kher,” revealed an AAP volunteer.

Meanwhile, BJP candidate Kirron Kher has promised a similar reservation for locals in ‘India’s Got Talent’. “Mat bano Roadies, bano asli star, abki baar Modi sarkar,” roared Kirron Kher while promoting her promise.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RaghuAAP.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-set-to-win-chandigarh-after-raghu-promises-50-reservation-in-roadies-for-locals-5036,AAP set to win Chandigarh after Raghu promises 50% reservation in Roadies for locals,,1396696263.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While trying to kill a mosquito sitting on his cheek, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal accidentally ended up slapping himself. However, the sight of Kejriwal being slapped angered his supporters so much that they ended up attacking the assaulter i.e. Kejriwal himself.

Sources tell Faking News that the AAP supremo was constantly urging his supporters to calm down, but the emotionally charged up supporters didn’t listen to their leader.

Kejriwal’s close aides taking him away from the angry supporters.

“We won’t let anybody hit Kejriwal sir, even if it is Kejriwal sir. We will teach a lesson to anyone daring to intimidate our leader,” said a furious AAP supporter when asked about the reason why he attacked his own party leader.

AAP supporters cooled down only after Kejriwal cleared the doubt and revealed that it was a mosquito that he was trying to kill, and that there was no intention of hurting himself.

Kejriwal further blamed BJP to clam down his supporters.

“What I felt from my short interaction with that mosquito that it was trained. I think BJP and Ambani are behind it. Considering the amount of money they have, they can do anything,” the former CM of Delhi lashed out at the saffron party.

“Those who have hatched this plan knew that my supporters were going to attack me if I accidentally slap myself. They capitalized on the anger of the AAP supporters and tried to disturb internal peace of my party,” Kejriwal exposed the devious plans.

While the AAP chief was successful in calming down the supporters, he was shocked to see such reaction from them. Sources say that the party is thinking of organizing anger management classes at their office in Delhi.

Meanwhile the allegedly “paid mosquito” is still at large and AAP members are searching it in the streets of Delhi.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has declared “Secularism”, speculated to be worth 20 crore votes, as an asset while filing nomination papers for the general elections from her constituency Raebareli.

In the affidavit giving details of assets owned by her, she mentioned it as an immovable property, which she inherited from her in-laws.

Secularly rich family.

“Yes, it’s indeed an asset for my mother and subsequently an asset for Congress too. My grandmother, my father, my mother, me, and my party have worked really hard to earn it and we are very proud of it,” said Rahul Gandhi who was accompanying Mrs. Gandhi at the district collectorate.

It’s being seen as an attempt by the grand old party to pass a strong message among the minorities of India.

“Look, how much she cares about secularism that she is putting it on the same level as that of money, gold, and real estate. It’s hard to find someone with such a love for secularism,” explained a senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh highlighting Mrs. Gandhi’s level of commitment toward the cause.

To gain a deep insight into how secular affluence is going to help Sonia Gandhi in the upcoming general elections, Faking News talked to famous election analyst Chunavi Chaudhary.

“In the current electoral market, it’s one of the hottest commodity that politicians are trading in. It has power to get you political allies. All you need to do is to keep it close to you, that’s all and it pays high dividend during elections,” described Chunavi Chaudhary.

“Secularism has been a very important asset for Congress and it has helped the party on numerous occasions. And as Sonia Gandhi is trying to get her property certified by Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari, it’s value is going to skyrocket for sure,” Mr Chaudhary added further.

Reportedly, Sonia Gandhi has even loaned a bit of secularism to Lalu Yadav, Congress political ally in Bihar. However, Lalu downplayed the claims. “Are budbak, ulta I have given her loan,” Lalu claimed

After critics attacked Modi over his false developmental claims and proved how backward Gujarat is, Gujarat government has decided to demand special category state status from the central government.

Gujarat government hopes that the special category status – usually given to underdeveloped states with governments that are supporting the central government – will help Gujarat overcome its backwardness.

A posh area of Ahmedabad.

This decision of Gujarat government comes as a huge surprise to critics of Narendra Modi who have exposed him incessantly on his developmental claims.

Later, our paid reporter investigated why Gujarat government has taken such a drastic step and also talked to various critics of Modi.

On being asked about the surprising move, chief secretary(Government of Gujarat) explained, “After allegations by Arvind Kejriwal and opposition leaders about the developmental claims of Gujarat being false, we investigated the allegations and found them to be true. Gujarat has no development in last 10 years. In fact, on a closer study we found that Gujarat’s economy has actually deteriorated in the last decade.”

“On realizing that Gujarat developmental model has failed, we started looking for alternative developmental models. Then we came across Bihar Model and found it the best. Following the model we’ve also demanded special category status from center,” he added further.

Our reporter then approached critics of Modi to seek their response. On being asked to comment Arvind Kejriwal, who visited Gujarat few days ago to verify development of Gujarat but found none, said, “Modi is lying. Next week I’ll go to Gujarat to verify backwardness claims of Modi government.”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh lashed out at Modi over the move, “Modi has done nothing to impoverish Gujarat, its the hardlyworking population of Gujarat which has achieved underdevelopment, besides Gujarat has a history of underdevelopment going back to centuries.”

Modi’s Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar didn’t take kindly to this development, he is reported to have said that Gujarat underdevelopment is a hype and it was Bihar that was more underdeveloped and deserves special category status.

Addressing a public gathering in the capital, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has promised to build a pipeline between Earth and gas giant Jupiter, if his party is voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections.

Jupiter, one of the four gas planets beside Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, is composed primarily of Hydrogen, which is often considered as fuel of the future.

Simple, elegant and visionary plan.

“We are determined to fix the gas problem which our country is facing. Construction of a pipeline between Earth and Jupiter is going to free us from the claws of gas exploration companies,” declared Kejriwal amidst chanting of ‘Jupiter zindabad’ by excited AAP supporters.

“It’s just a one time cost, after that there will be nothing but gas; I mean we will distribute gas free of cost,” added Kejriwal.

“Each household will be having a direct connection from the main pipeline, people will be having freedom to use it as they wish,” he explained the benefits of AAP government.

The rookie party has included building of gas pipeline in their manifesto. After consuming whole of Jupiter, their plan is to add few extra hundred million miles of pipe to the existing system and then start consuming Saturn.

AAP bashed gas exploration companies like Reliance Industries and Chevron Corporation of intentionally avoiding Jupiter as source of gas. “The sheer abundance of gas is going to bring down the gas price, that’s why they are afraid of exploring Jupiter. It’s a big conspiracy,” claimed another AAP leader.

Kejriwal also blamed his political rival Modi of being hand in gloves with Ambani to keep Jupiter’s gas potential out of election agenda.

“Modi never talked about Jupiter. AAP is the only party which has courage to raise this issue, this is real pro-development attitude and foresightedness,” claimed Kejriwal lashing out at Modi.

However, on being asked how they are going to build such long pipeline, Kejriwal said, “Desh ka aam aadmi jag chuka hai, so please, don’t underestimate the power of a common man.”

Meanwhile, Congress has accused AAP of hijacking his Rahul Gandhi’s Jupiter’s agenda. “It was Rahul ji who first brought Jupiter into picture and AAP is capitalizing on that,” Congress leader Salman Khurshid said while attacking AAP.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EarthJupiter.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-promises-to-build-a-pipeline-between-gas-planet-jupiter-and-earth-if-voted-to-power-5010,"Kejriwal promises to build a pipeline between gas planet Jupiter and Earth, if voted to power",,1396432239.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kejriwal’s deafening silence caught media attention after no verbal attacks on BJP, Congress, Ambani, and Adani by him were recorded since this morning.

Trying to keep his mouth shut.

When asked about the reason of this surprising silence, Kejriwal clarified, “No matter what you say, people don’t take you seriously on 1st of April. So better not to make such sensitive allegations on 1st April, as people might confuse it as some prank.”

“For today, all politicians are honest, no media is paid, and I am an idiot. It’s one of those rare days when sun rose from the west,” quipped Kejriwal.

However, sources reveal that it all started last midnight when Kejriwal, while having a chat with his close aide, reiterated his famous dialogue, ‘Sab mile huye hain’, following which his aide started laughing as he was reading April Fools’ Day jokes on Twitter at the same time.

It was then Kejriwal decided to keep his mouth shut for the whole day.

As per political experts, it’s a much required break which Kejriwal needed to maintain his high spirits. “He has been playing this blame game recklessly for last few months. This break is going to detoxicate him,” explained a political analyst.

This is the first day since Kejriwal formed his party when he will be spending 24 hours without calling rival politicians and big businessmen corrupt and thief.

Even Kejriwal accept the fact that, it’s not going to be easy for him to pass a whole day just like a normal person. “It’s like navrata fasting and I am really not habituated to this,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,"Bangalore. In order to attract unemployed engineers of the city, Congress candidate from Bangalore South, Nandan Nilekani has promised a scheme similar to MGNREGA.

“Rajiv Gandhi National Technology Employment Guarantee Act (RGNTEGA) will ensure at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to all the unemployed software engineers of Bangalore,” said Nilekani while announcing his second most ambitious project after Aadhaar Card.

“I know them, now they are going to vote for me.”

“It’s not a new thing for me, as even when I was in Infosys, we used to do bulk hiring from engineering colleges. It was the same work, but in corporate style,” Nilekani added further, highlighting his past work experience of handling such projects.

When asked about possible danger of RGNTEGA meeting the same fate as that of Aadhaar Card scheme, Nilekani rejected the apprehension and said that the presence of ‘Rajiv Gandhi’ in project name is sufficient enough for its success.

As per sources close to Nilekani, most of the engineers getting employment through RGNTEGA would be working on a dream web project of Rahul Gandhi.

“Rahul wants to empower Indians by creating a website with combined features of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, IRCTC, YouTube, Wikipedia and LinkedIn,” a Congress insider revealed to Faking News.

“When it comes to being a visionary, his imagination knows no boundaries,” the insider explained.

Considering huge population of jobless engineers in Bangalore, Nilekani’s move is being seen as a masterstroke.

Even the punchline of the scheme, ‘Har ungli shakti, har ungli tarakki‘, which reportedly was coined by Congress VP Rahul Gandhi, is quite apt and going viral among the jobless IT crowd.

Although many of the jobless engineers are happy with the news, they are also expecting ‘bench’ culture during their employment period under RGNTEGA.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-rally-a-huge-success-in-assam-as-people-mistake-it-for-meditation-camp-4994,"Guwahati. The people of Assam felt a mix of inner peace and boredom as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a prolific orator, kept quiet for 3 hours instead of giving a speech.

The people who attended the gathering were astounded by the intense silence of the Prime Minister and started meditating. Few claim to be enlightened.

Golden silence

A local school teacher, who spoke to our correspondent said, “A subject on our Prime Minister’s silence should be inducted into our curriculum to ensure that students are silent in class.”

The school teacher also remarked that he will tweet Dr. Shashi Tharoor about it. Another local who was awed by the speech silence, remarked, “He sounded just like James Bond when he said his last and only two words: Theek Hai!”

Among those inspired were three engineering students – Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. They have decided to improve the country’s economic situation by extracting gold from the Prime Minister’s silence. The students told Faking News, “We want to prove that Silence is indeed golden.”

The rally came to an end when a cop, ACP Jai Dixit broke the silence and questioned the Prime Minister as to why he hasn’t been promoted since 2004.

The supercop had recently helped the Chicago Police Department in catching a criminal and his autistic twin, and yet did not get a promotion. Apparently, this is when the Prime minister said Theek Hai and concluded the meditation camp rally.

Home Minister Mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde later issued a statement saying, “ACP Jai Dixit is getting promotions without his Knowledge.”

Meanwhile this radical approach of campaigning has garnered a lot of interest. Congress spokesman Jha praised the leadership of the party for this innovation. “This is a huge success of Rahul baba’s policies. Now we know he is not only an expert in tearing and throwing policies but also an expert in making them,” claimed Jha.

But members of the opposing parties have claimed that the Prime Minister’s rally was nonsense. Mr.Rahul Gandhi, who was visibly infuriated by the comments, came in support of his Prime Minister and a made a statement saying, “This is outrageous. Only I can say nonsense when it comes to our Prime Minister. Who do they think they are?”

Before storming out, he added that silence was also a state of mind.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ManmohanMeditation.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-rally-a-huge-success-in-assam-as-people-mistake-it-for-meditation-camp-4994,PM’s rally a huge success in Assam as people mistake it for meditation camp,,1396270695.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-exposes-dettols-claim-of-100-protection-4986,"New Delhi. In a developing story, Arvind Kejriwal of AAP has come down heavily of the manufacturer of Dettol brand of products Reckitt Benckiser for claiming “100% protection” from germs.

In a hurriedly called press conference, which was attended by half of his own media men turned AAP members, he declared, “There is no 100% safety as proclaimed by Dettol model of cleanliness by a crony capitalist company like Reckitt Benckiser.”

Exposed!!

He also alleged that his research team has shown that Reckitt Benckiser is actually owned by Ambani and Adani through a highly sophisticated maze of share holdings and cross-investments, and that the entire idea behind this “propaganda” in “paid media” was done by Narendra Modi to ensure that Ambani and Adani, via their crony company Reckitt Benckiser, would be able to spread this false assurance in the rest of India that Dettol is 100% safe.

He further claimed that he has personally examined his hands after being washed by Dettol Hand Wash and found 0.01 % of germs still remaining. When counter questioned by an attending journalist that this proved that 99.99% of the germs were indeed killed, he thundered back accusing the journalist of being “paid” and said, “aap sab bike hue hai. All of you are paid. What about 0.01% germs ? Where is the cleanliness, hygiene and safety as promised by Dettol? If you cannot remove even 0.01 % of germs, how can you claim to clean the entire country?”

The journalist who asked the question was left wondering if he should work for free from now onward to avoid being labelled “paid” by all and sundry.

When asked why he was not saying anything about what had caused the 99.99% of the germs on his hands, in the first place, he did not give a straight answer. He only said, “Please provide evidence that my hands are in a mess because of the filth created in this country governed by Congress for more than 60 years out of 67 years and I will arrest the germ causing agent in less than 3 hours.”

“Main bahut chotta aadmi hun, meri koi auqaat nahi hai, lekin main is desh ki hygiene habits badalne aya hun. I will ensure that when my government comes to power, I will remove 100% of the germs by bringing in my own version of ‘GermThokPal’ bill. Is desh ka aam admi ab jaag gaya hai and he will not tolerate even 0.01% of the germs,” he went on to add.

The press conference ended on a happy note when some AAP members showered each other with black ink, and then promptly proceeded to wash the ink stains off with Dettol.

Punya Prasoon Bajpai termed the press conference as “Krantikari, bahut krantikari.“

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"New Delhi. In a shocking move, BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi has decided to opt out from the race of country’s top job. Experts say that he peaked too early and felt symptoms of fatigue, ending in voluntary withdrawal from the race.

Totally confused about what to do and not willing to go back to LK Adavni, BJP announced that Coder Singh, a 33-year-old person with no political experience, was their new PM candidate. Coder Singh is an ex-software engineer with 5 years of development experience in .NET, a Microsoft developed framework.

Communal Code

But despite his blank political background, he is being called a communal, controversial, divisive, and a threat to the “idea of India” by the same people who earlier claimed that they were opposed to Modi only, and not BJP per se.

“Hinduism, I mean, Hindu nationalism is a threat to this country and Coder’s mind must be decoded. I think he is dangerous to our pluralistic society,” Panchsheel Tripathi, a London based liberal tweeted within two minutes of BJP announcing its new candidate.

Not only alleged intellectuals, but political opponents too announced that they will not let Coder get success in capturing Delhi.

Soon after the announcement, UPA cabinet passed an ordinance to bring software codes written in private companies under RTI. Reportedly, they did so to dig into Coder’s past work. They hired some top class software engineers, not under eNREGA scheme that is used to hire only low class trolls but under professional contracts, to scrutinize the codes written by Coder Singh.

Apparently the hired software engineers could find some bug, which led Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to launch a scathing attack on Coder Singh. She immediately called him “Bug ka Saudagar” and her fellow party members made serious allegations about his past.

“We found ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in one of the comments that he added in his code block while working for a software company in 2012. This is the new face of Internet Hindus and right-wing ideology,” claimed Digvijay Singh showing a snippet of the code as proof.

However, Coder Singh himself is very proud of his coding past. He even showed a bug-free application that he developed while working with one of the companies.

“It has been given clean chit by testers of that company, it’s totally bug free and many have praised my codes for being as beautiful as poetry,” the new PM candidate of BJP told Faking News.

However claims of being bug free was rejected by AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who raised question marks over the quality of application developed by Coder Singh.

“Who are these testers, sab mile huye hain ji. I have tested it rigorously for 2 days, it’s flawed and buggy,” claimed Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference.

On being asked about specific details of the bugs, he warned media to not doubt his testing skills. “Although I have no development experience, but I am a born tester,” he said.

Kejriwal even slammed Coder Singh for working on Microsoft Technologies.

“Why he didn’t use open source frameworks? Why he preferred C# over PHP? He is hand in gloves with tech goon Microsoft. If he comes to power, he is going to promote Bill Gates agenda and all open source coders will die without job,” Kejriwal claimed.

Latest reports suggest that BJP is planning to drop Coder Singh as PM candidate and look for a candidate that will be accepted by people who would anyway never vote for the party.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommunalCode-300x151.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"Modi opts out of PM race, BJP puts up an ex-software engineer as new candidate",,1396009520.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,"New Delhi. In a blow to Rahul Gandhi’s dreams of an India full of rights, the left-handed community has come out strongly against the recent spate of ‘Right to xyz’ bills proposed by the Congress.

“Congress claims to work for minorities, but why is it ignoring the handedness minority?” asked an angry Vaman, President of All India Left-handers’ Association, who works with the MNC Bayer.

When explained that the names of the bills have possibly misled him, he retorted, “Oh yeah?Next you will tell me that the name ‘Indian Premier League’ is misleading and it is held in UAE… Oh wait…”

One of the protesters

“But there is no confusion,” he quickly added, “If there could be a ‘Right to Entrepreneurship’ in the party manifesto, why not ‘Right to Left handed writing’ too? I mean, both of these make equal sense.”

“Or the best would be if they change their symbol from right hand to left hand,” he demanded.

But lefties are not the only one to object to the move; the moment Congress’s new manifesto was announced, Leftist parties vociferously opposed what they referred to as ‘poisonous rightist policies’. Later the high-level think-tanks of these parties opined that these policies were, in fact, leftist, and hence the opposition was hastily withdrawn and underplayed.

When asked by this reporter if the bills were against lefties, a Congressman emphatically said, “Rahul Gandhi will tell you the importance of the bills.” When asked about the whereabouts of Rahul Gandhi, he revealed that it was Rahul Gandhi himself speaking.

He then continued, “You people laugh at me when I answer every question by saying that we passed the Right to Information Act. Now I will pass so many ‘Right to fill-in-the-blanks’ bills that I can answer any question you ask. So next time you ask me if I’m afraid of losing to Narendra Modi, I will tell you that we passed the Right to be Unafraid of Narendra Modi Act. Genius, no?”

When further pressed on the actual contents of these bills, Rahul Gandhi said that they will empower women, and after pausing for effect, added, “Both right-handed AND left-handed.”

AAP workers’ reactions were even more scathing.

“The bills are a right-wing conspiracy,” a junior worker holding a broom in his left hand said, “thus proving that the Congress and BJP are one and the same.”

A BJP party worker blamed it all on Sonia Gandhi. “There is clearly a foreign right hand behind the bills.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/left-handed-products.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,Left-handed community gets offended by Congress’ spate of ‘Right to’ bills,,1395996280.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-introduce-inkpal-bill-that-will-ban-ink-and-fountain-pens-if-voted-to-power-4971,"Varanasi. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced today at a rally that if voted to power, AAP will introduce an Inkpal bill that will have provisions to ban manufacture, sale, and possession of all kinds of ink and fountain pens. This comes in the wake of a sharp upswing in the number of incidents involving ink throwing at politicians.

The move has been supported by all political parties and thus, the Inkpal bill is expected to be passed easily in the Parliament. As per the Inkpal bill, possession of ink of any color will be punishable under POTA as well as under section 302 of the IPC.

Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has always been on the hit list of ink throwing wannabe patriots, has demanded that the fountain pen be classified under ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’ and that all leading corrupt nations should come forward and sign a treaty ratifying this.

“Ink throwing is a black mark on Indian democracy, and Rahul Baba always hated ink, pens anyway,” muttered the Congress leader before putting on his helmet back to avoid being inked.

The attack that led AAP leaders to demand Inkpal Bill.

AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha too has voiced her support saying she was anguished at the very thought of someone smudging her precious silk sarees with black ink.

The RSS has however opposed this move, saying that an exception should be made for Saffron ink. Similar views have been echoed by the IUML which said that the proposal to ban Green colored ink was a conspiracy against the minority community by Narendra Modi. Noticeably, right wing leader Pramod Mutalik has maintained a studied silence on this issue.

However, economists have cautioned against any hasty moves to ban ink as it could have major ramifications on the economy.

“With so many corrupt and irritating politicians around, many small scale ink factories have come up to fulfill the demand for black ink, they will have nowhere to go if the Inkpal bill becomes a reality,” said leading economist Swami S Inklesariya Iyer.

Economists have further warned that such a move could also affect bilateral trade relations with our neighbors. Pakistan, which is a major manufacturer and supplier of counterfeit ink, has threatened to take this issue to the WTO, UN, and the UNHRC.

Rubber Stamp Dealers Association (RSDA) secretary Manhoman Singh too lamented the move and pointed out that it will lead to loss of jobs. “How do they expect good quality rubber stamps without any ink?” he asked in agony.

The Indian Dental Association has vowed to protest against the proposed Inkpal bill, tooth and nail. Our sources say that dentists around India were making a killing with so many politicians with black ink stains turning up for a flossing and cleaning session. Although with most of India’s politicians being over 85 and having lost their dentures long ago, this argument doesn’t hold much water.

While campaigning for Gul Panag, the AAP candidate from the ‘city beautiful’, Raghu of Roadies fame promised 50% reservation for people of Chandigarh, if they voted the rookie party to power.

With this announcement, Aam Aadmi Party has seemingly captured the mood of the local youth, and considering the craze for the reality show among the city’s youngsters, Gul Panag is being seen as a clear winner from the constituency.

“I am what I am”

“I always felt that Chandigarh has the capacity to provide many more Roadies than we usually select from here. 50% reservation will ensure that we select almost all the deserving candidates, instead of being forced to select just 3-4 people,” said Raghu while addressing a gathering comprising of aspiring Roadies and media men.

Raghu’s lofty promise targeting the first time voters has led to celebrations across the whole city.

“Now I am going to vote for AAP, nobody can stop me. I will even convince my family members to vote for AAP, I am sure they will agree, after all it’s about my career!” said Balwinder Singh, a final year engineering student.

“Roadies, I am coming, Raghu I am coming, Ranvijay I am coming. I am what I am, #@$%#%%,” Balwinder finished talking on a high note.

Raghu’s declaration has not only struck a chord with the first time voters, but has also provided some respite to many others who have been trying to get into Roadies for years.

Rohit Sharma, a man in his early 30s has been trying to get selected for Roadies since season one.

“Raghu sir’s promise is like the last ray of hope for me and many others like me. My hair is turning grey, but still I haven’t got an opportunity to showcase my talent of abusing and shouting loud,” teary eyed Rohit described his pain. Rohit feels that reservation in Roadies was necessary for social upliftment of people like him.

Meanwhile sensing a business opportunity, a couple of ex-Roadies have even started a coaching class to teach people, how to clear Roadies’ form filling, group discussion, and personal interview.

Energized by the public response, Chandigarh AAP has created a separate team to educate these young Roadies fans about voting process to ensure that the excitement is translated into votes.

“It is basically for those hardcore Roadies fans who believe that you need to vote for the opposition to vote them out. It’s just a precautionary measure to make sure that they don’t press the BJP’s symbol to vote out Kirron Kher,” revealed an AAP volunteer.

Meanwhile, BJP candidate Kirron Kher has promised a similar reservation for locals in ‘India’s Got Talent’. “Mat bano Roadies, bano asli star, abki baar Modi sarkar,” roared Kirron Kher while promoting her promise.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RaghuAAP.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-set-to-win-chandigarh-after-raghu-promises-50-reservation-in-roadies-for-locals-5036,AAP set to win Chandigarh after Raghu promises 50% reservation in Roadies for locals,,1396696263.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While trying to kill a mosquito sitting on his cheek, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal accidentally ended up slapping himself. However, the sight of Kejriwal being slapped angered his supporters so much that they ended up attacking the assaulter i.e. Kejriwal himself.

Sources tell Faking News that the AAP supremo was constantly urging his supporters to calm down, but the emotionally charged up supporters didn’t listen to their leader.

Kejriwal’s close aides taking him away from the angry supporters.

“We won’t let anybody hit Kejriwal sir, even if it is Kejriwal sir. We will teach a lesson to anyone daring to intimidate our leader,” said a furious AAP supporter when asked about the reason why he attacked his own party leader.

AAP supporters cooled down only after Kejriwal cleared the doubt and revealed that it was a mosquito that he was trying to kill, and that there was no intention of hurting himself.

Kejriwal further blamed BJP to clam down his supporters.

“What I felt from my short interaction with that mosquito that it was trained. I think BJP and Ambani are behind it. Considering the amount of money they have, they can do anything,” the former CM of Delhi lashed out at the saffron party.

“Those who have hatched this plan knew that my supporters were going to attack me if I accidentally slap myself. They capitalized on the anger of the AAP supporters and tried to disturb internal peace of my party,” Kejriwal exposed the devious plans.

While the AAP chief was successful in calming down the supporters, he was shocked to see such reaction from them. Sources say that the party is thinking of organizing anger management classes at their office in Delhi.

Meanwhile the allegedly “paid mosquito” is still at large and AAP members are searching it in the streets of Delhi.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has declared “Secularism”, speculated to be worth 20 crore votes, as an asset while filing nomination papers for the general elections from her constituency Raebareli.

In the affidavit giving details of assets owned by her, she mentioned it as an immovable property, which she inherited from her in-laws.

Secularly rich family.

“Yes, it’s indeed an asset for my mother and subsequently an asset for Congress too. My grandmother, my father, my mother, me, and my party have worked really hard to earn it and we are very proud of it,” said Rahul Gandhi who was accompanying Mrs. Gandhi at the district collectorate.

It’s being seen as an attempt by the grand old party to pass a strong message among the minorities of India.

“Look, how much she cares about secularism that she is putting it on the same level as that of money, gold, and real estate. It’s hard to find someone with such a love for secularism,” explained a senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh highlighting Mrs. Gandhi’s level of commitment toward the cause.

To gain a deep insight into how secular affluence is going to help Sonia Gandhi in the upcoming general elections, Faking News talked to famous election analyst Chunavi Chaudhary.

“In the current electoral market, it’s one of the hottest commodity that politicians are trading in. It has power to get you political allies. All you need to do is to keep it close to you, that’s all and it pays high dividend during elections,” described Chunavi Chaudhary.

“Secularism has been a very important asset for Congress and it has helped the party on numerous occasions. And as Sonia Gandhi is trying to get her property certified by Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari, it’s value is going to skyrocket for sure,” Mr Chaudhary added further.

Reportedly, Sonia Gandhi has even loaned a bit of secularism to Lalu Yadav, Congress political ally in Bihar. However, Lalu downplayed the claims. “Are budbak, ulta I have given her loan,” Lalu claimed

After critics attacked Modi over his false developmental claims and proved how backward Gujarat is, Gujarat government has decided to demand special category state status from the central government.

Gujarat government hopes that the special category status – usually given to underdeveloped states with governments that are supporting the central government – will help Gujarat overcome its backwardness.

A posh area of Ahmedabad.

This decision of Gujarat government comes as a huge surprise to critics of Narendra Modi who have exposed him incessantly on his developmental claims.

Later, our paid reporter investigated why Gujarat government has taken such a drastic step and also talked to various critics of Modi.

On being asked about the surprising move, chief secretary(Government of Gujarat) explained, “After allegations by Arvind Kejriwal and opposition leaders about the developmental claims of Gujarat being false, we investigated the allegations and found them to be true. Gujarat has no development in last 10 years. In fact, on a closer study we found that Gujarat’s economy has actually deteriorated in the last decade.”

“On realizing that Gujarat developmental model has failed, we started looking for alternative developmental models. Then we came across Bihar Model and found it the best. Following the model we’ve also demanded special category status from center,” he added further.

Our reporter then approached critics of Modi to seek their response. On being asked to comment Arvind Kejriwal, who visited Gujarat few days ago to verify development of Gujarat but found none, said, “Modi is lying. Next week I’ll go to Gujarat to verify backwardness claims of Modi government.”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh lashed out at Modi over the move, “Modi has done nothing to impoverish Gujarat, its the hardlyworking population of Gujarat which has achieved underdevelopment, besides Gujarat has a history of underdevelopment going back to centuries.”

Modi’s Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar didn’t take kindly to this development, he is reported to have said that Gujarat underdevelopment is a hype and it was Bihar that was more underdeveloped and deserves special category status.

Addressing a public gathering in the capital, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has promised to build a pipeline between Earth and gas giant Jupiter, if his party is voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections.

Jupiter, one of the four gas planets beside Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, is composed primarily of Hydrogen, which is often considered as fuel of the future.

Simple, elegant and visionary plan.

“We are determined to fix the gas problem which our country is facing. Construction of a pipeline between Earth and Jupiter is going to free us from the claws of gas exploration companies,” declared Kejriwal amidst chanting of ‘Jupiter zindabad’ by excited AAP supporters.

“It’s just a one time cost, after that there will be nothing but gas; I mean we will distribute gas free of cost,” added Kejriwal.

“Each household will be having a direct connection from the main pipeline, people will be having freedom to use it as they wish,” he explained the benefits of AAP government.

The rookie party has included building of gas pipeline in their manifesto. After consuming whole of Jupiter, their plan is to add few extra hundred million miles of pipe to the existing system and then start consuming Saturn.

AAP bashed gas exploration companies like Reliance Industries and Chevron Corporation of intentionally avoiding Jupiter as source of gas. “The sheer abundance of gas is going to bring down the gas price, that’s why they are afraid of exploring Jupiter. It’s a big conspiracy,” claimed another AAP leader.

Kejriwal also blamed his political rival Modi of being hand in gloves with Ambani to keep Jupiter’s gas potential out of election agenda.

“Modi never talked about Jupiter. AAP is the only party which has courage to raise this issue, this is real pro-development attitude and foresightedness,” claimed Kejriwal lashing out at Modi.

However, on being asked how they are going to build such long pipeline, Kejriwal said, “Desh ka aam aadmi jag chuka hai, so please, don’t underestimate the power of a common man.”

Meanwhile, Congress has accused AAP of hijacking his Rahul Gandhi’s Jupiter’s agenda. “It was Rahul ji who first brought Jupiter into picture and AAP is capitalizing on that,” Congress leader Salman Khurshid said while attacking AAP.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EarthJupiter.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-promises-to-build-a-pipeline-between-gas-planet-jupiter-and-earth-if-voted-to-power-5010,"Kejriwal promises to build a pipeline between gas planet Jupiter and Earth, if voted to power",,1396432239.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kejriwal’s deafening silence caught media attention after no verbal attacks on BJP, Congress, Ambani, and Adani by him were recorded since this morning.

Trying to keep his mouth shut.

When asked about the reason of this surprising silence, Kejriwal clarified, “No matter what you say, people don’t take you seriously on 1st of April. So better not to make such sensitive allegations on 1st April, as people might confuse it as some prank.”

“For today, all politicians are honest, no media is paid, and I am an idiot. It’s one of those rare days when sun rose from the west,” quipped Kejriwal.

However, sources reveal that it all started last midnight when Kejriwal, while having a chat with his close aide, reiterated his famous dialogue, ‘Sab mile huye hain’, following which his aide started laughing as he was reading April Fools’ Day jokes on Twitter at the same time.

It was then Kejriwal decided to keep his mouth shut for the whole day.

As per political experts, it’s a much required break which Kejriwal needed to maintain his high spirits. “He has been playing this blame game recklessly for last few months. This break is going to detoxicate him,” explained a political analyst.

This is the first day since Kejriwal formed his party when he will be spending 24 hours without calling rival politicians and big businessmen corrupt and thief.

Even Kejriwal accept the fact that, it’s not going to be easy for him to pass a whole day just like a normal person. “It’s like navrata fasting and I am really not habituated to this,” Kejriwal told Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,"Bangalore. In order to attract unemployed engineers of the city, Congress candidate from Bangalore South, Nandan Nilekani has promised a scheme similar to MGNREGA.

“Rajiv Gandhi National Technology Employment Guarantee Act (RGNTEGA) will ensure at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to all the unemployed software engineers of Bangalore,” said Nilekani while announcing his second most ambitious project after Aadhaar Card.

“I know them, now they are going to vote for me.”

“It’s not a new thing for me, as even when I was in Infosys, we used to do bulk hiring from engineering colleges. It was the same work, but in corporate style,” Nilekani added further, highlighting his past work experience of handling such projects.

When asked about possible danger of RGNTEGA meeting the same fate as that of Aadhaar Card scheme, Nilekani rejected the apprehension and said that the presence of ‘Rajiv Gandhi’ in project name is sufficient enough for its success.

As per sources close to Nilekani, most of the engineers getting employment through RGNTEGA would be working on a dream web project of Rahul Gandhi.

“Rahul wants to empower Indians by creating a website with combined features of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, IRCTC, YouTube, Wikipedia and LinkedIn,” a Congress insider revealed to Faking News.

“When it comes to being a visionary, his imagination knows no boundaries,” the insider explained.

Considering huge population of jobless engineers in Bangalore, Nilekani’s move is being seen as a masterstroke.

Even the punchline of the scheme, ‘Har ungli shakti, har ungli tarakki‘, which reportedly was coined by Congress VP Rahul Gandhi, is quite apt and going viral among the jobless IT crowd.

Although many of the jobless engineers are happy with the news, they are also expecting ‘bench’ culture during their employment period under RGNTEGA.

“Job and all are fine, but for a proper work life balance, a minimum 20 days of bench warming would be good enough,” said a 2010 engineering pass out. With elections round the corner, it’s highly probable that Nilekani would agree to engineers’ demand.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Nandan-Nilekani.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nandan-nilekani-promises-scheme-like-nrega-for-unemployed-engineers-of-bangalore-4998,Nandan Nilekani promises scheme like NREGA for unemployed engineers of Bangalore,,1396273152.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-rally-a-huge-success-in-assam-as-people-mistake-it-for-meditation-camp-4994,"Guwahati. The people of Assam felt a mix of inner peace and boredom as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a prolific orator, kept quiet for 3 hours instead of giving a speech.

The people who attended the gathering were astounded by the intense silence of the Prime Minister and started meditating. Few claim to be enlightened.

Golden silence

A local school teacher, who spoke to our correspondent said, “A subject on our Prime Minister’s silence should be inducted into our curriculum to ensure that students are silent in class.”

The school teacher also remarked that he will tweet Dr. Shashi Tharoor about it. Another local who was awed by the speech silence, remarked, “He sounded just like James Bond when he said his last and only two words: Theek Hai!”

Among those inspired were three engineering students – Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. They have decided to improve the country’s economic situation by extracting gold from the Prime Minister’s silence. The students told Faking News, “We want to prove that Silence is indeed golden.”

The rally came to an end when a cop, ACP Jai Dixit broke the silence and questioned the Prime Minister as to why he hasn’t been promoted since 2004.

The supercop had recently helped the Chicago Police Department in catching a criminal and his autistic twin, and yet did not get a promotion. Apparently, this is when the Prime minister said Theek Hai and concluded the meditation camp rally.

Home Minister Mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde later issued a statement saying, “ACP Jai Dixit is getting promotions without his Knowledge.”

Meanwhile this radical approach of campaigning has garnered a lot of interest. Congress spokesman Jha praised the leadership of the party for this innovation. “This is a huge success of Rahul baba’s policies. Now we know he is not only an expert in tearing and throwing policies but also an expert in making them,” claimed Jha.

But members of the opposing parties have claimed that the Prime Minister’s rally was nonsense. Mr.Rahul Gandhi, who was visibly infuriated by the comments, came in support of his Prime Minister and a made a statement saying, “This is outrageous. Only I can say nonsense when it comes to our Prime Minister. Who do they think they are?”

Before storming out, he added that silence was also a state of mind.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ManmohanMeditation.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pms-rally-a-huge-success-in-assam-as-people-mistake-it-for-meditation-camp-4994,PM’s rally a huge success in Assam as people mistake it for meditation camp,,1396270695.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-exposes-dettols-claim-of-100-protection-4986,"New Delhi. In a developing story, Arvind Kejriwal of AAP has come down heavily of the manufacturer of Dettol brand of products Reckitt Benckiser for claiming “100% protection” from germs.

In a hurriedly called press conference, which was attended by half of his own media men turned AAP members, he declared, “There is no 100% safety as proclaimed by Dettol model of cleanliness by a crony capitalist company like Reckitt Benckiser.”

Exposed!!

He also alleged that his research team has shown that Reckitt Benckiser is actually owned by Ambani and Adani through a highly sophisticated maze of share holdings and cross-investments, and that the entire idea behind this “propaganda” in “paid media” was done by Narendra Modi to ensure that Ambani and Adani, via their crony company Reckitt Benckiser, would be able to spread this false assurance in the rest of India that Dettol is 100% safe.

He further claimed that he has personally examined his hands after being washed by Dettol Hand Wash and found 0.01 % of germs still remaining. When counter questioned by an attending journalist that this proved that 99.99% of the germs were indeed killed, he thundered back accusing the journalist of being “paid” and said, “aap sab bike hue hai. All of you are paid. What about 0.01% germs ? Where is the cleanliness, hygiene and safety as promised by Dettol? If you cannot remove even 0.01 % of germs, how can you claim to clean the entire country?”

The journalist who asked the question was left wondering if he should work for free from now onward to avoid being labelled “paid” by all and sundry.

When asked why he was not saying anything about what had caused the 99.99% of the germs on his hands, in the first place, he did not give a straight answer. He only said, “Please provide evidence that my hands are in a mess because of the filth created in this country governed by Congress for more than 60 years out of 67 years and I will arrest the germ causing agent in less than 3 hours.”

“Main bahut chotta aadmi hun, meri koi auqaat nahi hai, lekin main is desh ki hygiene habits badalne aya hun. I will ensure that when my government comes to power, I will remove 100% of the germs by bringing in my own version of ‘GermThokPal’ bill. Is desh ka aam admi ab jaag gaya hai and he will not tolerate even 0.01% of the germs,” he went on to add.

The press conference ended on a happy note when some AAP members showered each other with black ink, and then promptly proceeded to wash the ink stains off with Dettol.

Punya Prasoon Bajpai termed the press conference as “Krantikari, bahut krantikari.“

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"New Delhi. In a shocking move, BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi has decided to opt out from the race of country’s top job. Experts say that he peaked too early and felt symptoms of fatigue, ending in voluntary withdrawal from the race.

Totally confused about what to do and not willing to go back to LK Adavni, BJP announced that Coder Singh, a 33-year-old person with no political experience, was their new PM candidate. Coder Singh is an ex-software engineer with 5 years of development experience in .NET, a Microsoft developed framework.

Communal Code

But despite his blank political background, he is being called a communal, controversial, divisive, and a threat to the “idea of India” by the same people who earlier claimed that they were opposed to Modi only, and not BJP per se.

“Hinduism, I mean, Hindu nationalism is a threat to this country and Coder’s mind must be decoded. I think he is dangerous to our pluralistic society,” Panchsheel Tripathi, a London based liberal tweeted within two minutes of BJP announcing its new candidate.

Not only alleged intellectuals, but political opponents too announced that they will not let Coder get success in capturing Delhi.

Soon after the announcement, UPA cabinet passed an ordinance to bring software codes written in private companies under RTI. Reportedly, they did so to dig into Coder’s past work. They hired some top class software engineers, not under eNREGA scheme that is used to hire only low class trolls but under professional contracts, to scrutinize the codes written by Coder Singh.

Apparently the hired software engineers could find some bug, which led Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to launch a scathing attack on Coder Singh. She immediately called him “Bug ka Saudagar” and her fellow party members made serious allegations about his past.

“We found ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in one of the comments that he added in his code block while working for a software company in 2012. This is the new face of Internet Hindus and right-wing ideology,” claimed Digvijay Singh showing a snippet of the code as proof.

However, Coder Singh himself is very proud of his coding past. He even showed a bug-free application that he developed while working with one of the companies.

“It has been given clean chit by testers of that company, it’s totally bug free and many have praised my codes for being as beautiful as poetry,” the new PM candidate of BJP told Faking News.

However claims of being bug free was rejected by AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who raised question marks over the quality of application developed by Coder Singh.

“Who are these testers, sab mile huye hain ji. I have tested it rigorously for 2 days, it’s flawed and buggy,” claimed Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference.

On being asked about specific details of the bugs, he warned media to not doubt his testing skills. “Although I have no development experience, but I am a born tester,” he said.

Kejriwal even slammed Coder Singh for working on Microsoft Technologies.

“Why he didn’t use open source frameworks? Why he preferred C# over PHP? He is hand in gloves with tech goon Microsoft. If he comes to power, he is going to promote Bill Gates agenda and all open source coders will die without job,” Kejriwal claimed.

Latest reports suggest that BJP is planning to drop Coder Singh as PM candidate and look for a candidate that will be accepted by people who would anyway never vote for the party.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommunalCode-300x151.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/modi-opts-out-of-pm-race-bjp-puts-up-an-ex-software-engineer-as-new-candidate-4980,"Modi opts out of PM race, BJP puts up an ex-software engineer as new candidate",,1396009520.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,"New Delhi. In a blow to Rahul Gandhi’s dreams of an India full of rights, the left-handed community has come out strongly against the recent spate of ‘Right to xyz’ bills proposed by the Congress.

“Congress claims to work for minorities, but why is it ignoring the handedness minority?” asked an angry Vaman, President of All India Left-handers’ Association, who works with the MNC Bayer.

When explained that the names of the bills have possibly misled him, he retorted, “Oh yeah?Next you will tell me that the name ‘Indian Premier League’ is misleading and it is held in UAE… Oh wait…”

One of the protesters

“But there is no confusion,” he quickly added, “If there could be a ‘Right to Entrepreneurship’ in the party manifesto, why not ‘Right to Left handed writing’ too? I mean, both of these make equal sense.”

“Or the best would be if they change their symbol from right hand to left hand,” he demanded.

But lefties are not the only one to object to the move; the moment Congress’s new manifesto was announced, Leftist parties vociferously opposed what they referred to as ‘poisonous rightist policies’. Later the high-level think-tanks of these parties opined that these policies were, in fact, leftist, and hence the opposition was hastily withdrawn and underplayed.

When asked by this reporter if the bills were against lefties, a Congressman emphatically said, “Rahul Gandhi will tell you the importance of the bills.” When asked about the whereabouts of Rahul Gandhi, he revealed that it was Rahul Gandhi himself speaking.

He then continued, “You people laugh at me when I answer every question by saying that we passed the Right to Information Act. Now I will pass so many ‘Right to fill-in-the-blanks’ bills that I can answer any question you ask. So next time you ask me if I’m afraid of losing to Narendra Modi, I will tell you that we passed the Right to be Unafraid of Narendra Modi Act. Genius, no?”

When further pressed on the actual contents of these bills, Rahul Gandhi said that they will empower women, and after pausing for effect, added, “Both right-handed AND left-handed.”

AAP workers’ reactions were even more scathing.

“The bills are a right-wing conspiracy,” a junior worker holding a broom in his left hand said, “thus proving that the Congress and BJP are one and the same.”

A BJP party worker blamed it all on Sonia Gandhi. “There is clearly a foreign right hand behind the bills.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/left-handed-products.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/left-handed-community-gets-offended-by-congress-spate-of-right-to-bills-4978,Left-handed community gets offended by Congress’ spate of ‘Right to’ bills,,1395996280.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-to-introduce-inkpal-bill-that-will-ban-ink-and-fountain-pens-if-voted-to-power-4971,"Varanasi. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced today at a rally that if voted to power, AAP will introduce an Inkpal bill that will have provisions to ban manufacture, sale, and possession of all kinds of ink and fountain pens. This comes in the wake of a sharp upswing in the number of incidents involving ink throwing at politicians.

The move has been supported by all political parties and thus, the Inkpal bill is expected to be passed easily in the Parliament. As per the Inkpal bill, possession of ink of any color will be punishable under POTA as well as under section 302 of the IPC.

Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has always been on the hit list of ink throwing wannabe patriots, has demanded that the fountain pen be classified under ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’ and that all leading corrupt nations should come forward and sign a treaty ratifying this.

“Ink throwing is a black mark on Indian democracy, and Rahul Baba always hated ink, pens anyway,” muttered the Congress leader before putting on his helmet back to avoid being inked.

The attack that led AAP leaders to demand Inkpal Bill.

AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha too has voiced her support saying she was anguished at the very thought of someone smudging her precious silk sarees with black ink.

The RSS has however opposed this move, saying that an exception should be made for Saffron ink. Similar views have been echoed by the IUML which said that the proposal to ban Green colored ink was a conspiracy against the minority community by Narendra Modi. Noticeably, right wing leader Pramod Mutalik has maintained a studied silence on this issue.

However, economists have cautioned against any hasty moves to ban ink as it could have major ramifications on the economy.

“With so many corrupt and irritating politicians around, many small scale ink factories have come up to fulfill the demand for black ink, they will have nowhere to go if the Inkpal bill becomes a reality,” said leading economist Swami S Inklesariya Iyer.

Economists have further warned that such a move could also affect bilateral trade relations with our neighbors. Pakistan, which is a major manufacturer and supplier of counterfeit ink, has threatened to take this issue to the WTO, UN, and the UNHRC.

Rubber Stamp Dealers Association (RSDA) secretary Manhoman Singh too lamented the move and pointed out that it will lead to loss of jobs. “How do they expect good quality rubber stamps without any ink?” he asked in agony.

The Indian Dental Association has vowed to protest against the proposed Inkpal bill, tooth and nail. Our sources say that dentists around India were making a killing with so many politicians with black ink stains turning up for a flossing and cleaning session. Although with most of India’s politicians being over 85 and having lost their dentures long ago, this argument doesn’t hold much water.

How would these politicians have campaigned? Faking News brings to you their campaign pitches:

Narendra Modi: Here is my mid-term exam report card. I have scored 97 out of 100 marks. Give me a chance to write the final exam and I will score better than this. You might ask me how I scored so much. It is because I drink Gujarat ka doodh, which fills my 56-inch chest with energy and nationalism. Even if a puppy stands under me, I do not realize it because of my huge chest blocking my view.

Youth factor, now going back to school.

Rahul Gandhi: So what if I have got only 5 out of 100 marks? These are empowered scores. But I don’t understand why I got so less marks. On the day of the exam, I woke up in the morning, at night (check this video). And I revised all chapters thoroughly before going to the exam in the morning, at night.

I had written about women and empowerment for more than 10 pages. I had written about 2002 riots with sketches for more than 5 pages. You file an RTI and find out my answers. Something is wrong in this examination system. These report cards are nonsense and must be torn and thrown away.

Prashant Bhushan: I had actually written correct answers to all the questions, and my 25 sheet answer booklet was filled within 2 hours. But due to a referendum, I had to tear 24 sheets out of my booklet and give it to my neighbor. So I ended up getting only 4 out of 100 marks. But this is my personal performance. My friend needs your support. Here comes my friend.

Arvind Kejriwal: I scored just 5 out of 100 because Congress and BJP supporting goons did not allow me to write for more than 10 minutes. They were standing outside the exam hall at a window and making funny faces at me, due to which I returned my answer sheet and I went out of the hall. Let us talk about the crucial issues now. Why did Modi lose 3 marks?

He must have generously donated 1 mark to Reliance, 1 mark to Adani, and 1 mark to Tata. The 97 marks which Modi has got are communal and corrupt. I will apply for revaluation and photocopy of Modi’s answer booklet and prove to you that even the evaluator was corrupt in awarding marks to Modi. I will sit on a dharna on this issue now!

Nitish Kumar: I scored 33 out of 100 marks, but this is a huge achievement because Lalu had scored a big zero in the same exam. Also, please remember that I could score only because I had put tilak on my forehead and was wearing a topi. Today there are people who want to destroy this culture and I will not let it happen. I even kicked out my roomie when he refused to put tilak and topi. My history is also good, which helped me as Class Monitor. Now I want to become the Head Boy.

Lalu Yadav: all this exam wexam is for budbak people. Communal forces are writing obscene things on the blackboard and in the bathroom. Let us drive them out.

Mulayam Singh Yadav: I was given 10 marks in the exam, which caused me to give three ghunsa (blows) to the evaluator. तुअत्त लाइन पे आ गया.

Mayawati: I scored a zero in the board exam, but it was not CBSE board, but CBI board, and that zero means clean chit. Now I’m ready to take the main exam and I will top the exam, if there are no manuwadis checking the paper.

Jayalalithaa: I’ve scored 101 out of 100 marks in all subjects, where papers where checked by my followers. People now want to sit next to me on my bench so that they want to get that extra one mark. Prakash Karat even sat with me for a few minutes before I told him to get lost.

Mamata Banerjee: My report card and marks sheet were stolen by Maoists, but Anna has given me 100 out of 100 in all subjects. I don’t want to become Head Boy, but I will not allow any bad boy in school.

The sensational news has been confirmed by Home Ministry insiders, and is being seen as Shinde’s most ambitious project, since attending music launch of Rajjo, till date.

Name is Shinde, Sushilkumar Shinde.

Shinde had earlier promised a couple times that he would bring Dawood back to India and it was speculated by experts as the trump card by UPA before the general elections.

“Keeping in mind that Shinde ji himself is a movie buff, he came up with this plan by his own. He was hugely motivated after watching the movie D-Day, and has been thinking of a grand plan to nab the most wanted terrorist of India,” disclosed a close aide of Shinde on condition of anonymity.

The aide further informed that BCCI had wanted to host IPL in South Africa again, as was done during the last general elections. However, it was Shinde who suggested UAE.

“In fact, the government could have provided security to IPL, but Shinde ji intentionally refused it, making a solid ground for shifting the venue to UAE, where Dawood goes when he gets bored of mujras in Pakistan,” the aide further disclosed.

Shinde is banking upon old habits of Dawood, which include match fixing, which will pull him towards this secret trap called IPL.

“Shnde ji knows Dawood very well,” the aide pointed out.

As per sources, an Indian match-fixer (not Gurunath Meiyeppan or Vindoo Dara Singh) has already been planted as a mole in the inner circles of the D Company, without Dawood’s knowledge.

Not only the undercover match-fixer, Indian secret service agents have also reached major cities of UAE and are doing the groundwork.

“Shinde ji is personally taking care of each and every detail. He himself is undergoing the basic combat training, and most probably will lead the secret service team on the D-Day,” a home ministry official told Faking News.

“From being associated with foot in mouth, he will become an icon of head over shoulders,” the official claimed.

When asked for comments, the Union Home Minister confirmed that such a plan was in place. He thanked Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the opportunity to catch Dawood.

“But don’t tell anyone, we have to plan this in a secret manner,” Shinde said addressing a press conference.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shinde_bond.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ipl-in-uae-a-trap-set-by-shinde-to-catch-dawood-ibrahim-4860,IPL in UAE a trap set by Shinde to catch Dawood Ibrahim,,1394630764.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Though he has not zeroed in on the candidate, but a massive statewide hunt to find one such person has been ordered by him. Mulayam however warned candidates against approaching CBI by getting carried away due to honesty.

Sources tell Faking News that senior party leaders and workers are worried about party’s prospects post this announcement. Some of them are terming it a suicidal move and fear that the party may lose its USP and charm.

“Heavens wouldn’t have fallen if this decision was not taken. It’s not as if some buffaloes have gone missing or Madhuri has refused to dance. A totally avoidable decision that Netaji should reconsider. He shouldn’t forget his roots,” senior leader Azam Khan said.

“We are a party that doesn’t discriminate against criminals. We have been trying to win their hearts. I will be shattered if this actually happens,” said Kanpur MLA Irfan Solanki, one of the leading activists fighting for inclusive growth of criminals in the society.

Solanki later kidnapped a few doctors to discuss with them if Mulayam Singh Yadav needed some medication.

Sources say that some SP leaders are even threatening to join other party or form a Super Samajwadi Party made of hardcore criminals if Mulayam Singh Yadav didn’t change his decision.

However, experts say it’s quite normal for national parties at times to do complete opposite of their perceived image.

“Well when AAP can give ticket to an ex-IAS officer who reversed Khemka’s orders, why can’t SP give a ticket to person with clean record,” reasoned one such expert.

Meanwhile, unfazed by all the criticism, Mulayam Singh defended this decision.

Countering Modi’s claim that he would work as watchman for five years, Rahul Gandhi today emphasized the need to turn every Indian into watchman in a rally here.

Following Rahul’s remarks, Congress high command has issued an order making it mandatory for all Congressmen to wear watchman cap, at least till elections.

“With You, For You, Always”

“We want to make people feel safe. From now on, security of this country is in our hand, and steadily we will make India a country of watchmen,” claimed Rahul while sporting a watchman cap, “It’s high time that India shed its image of country of snake charmers.”

“Modi is so self-centric that he wants this job of watchman only for himself, but we believe in ‘main nahi, hum‘ philosophy,” Rahul added, taking a jibe at the BJP’s PM candidate.

Senior Congress leaders have hailed Rahul’s decision and called it a visionary move.

“Rahul Ji is trying to remove unemployment from our country. Imagine all Indians as watchman, we are going to be the first country in world to achieve 100% employment,” said party leader Salman Khurshid.

However, on being reminded that people will not be getting paid, Salman Khurshid argued, “Salary is just a state of mind.”

Sources tell Faking News that in order to implement Rahul Gandhi’s ideas, Congress is planning to turn itself into a part-time security agency, with soul aim to serve nation and that too without any fee.

Thousands and thousands of Congress workers are preparing to roam around on roads tonight wearing watchman cap.

“We have asked watchmen in our locality to go on leave till Lok Sabha elections. From here on, we will be handling security,” disclosed an excited party worker, “It will be fun to chase dogs at night.”

Meanwhile, political experts are claiming that the step by Congress is a befitting reply to BJP’s ‘chaiwala‘ agenda.

While campaigning in a press conference, Kejriwal claimed that it was Modi who misguided him and told him that those RTI activists were dead after he asked Modi about their details.

“Sachaai ke raaste pe takleef toh hoti hi hai ji,” Kejriwal said this some 200 times in the conference.

“Since I was to talk about RTI activists from Gujarat, I requested Modi ji’s office to send me their details. I was first shocked to see Modi himself sending an email to me but was later happy that aakhir ek aam aadmi ne shaasan dula hi diya. However the information in the mail turned out to be wrong,” Kejriwal told media.

“Everybody knows how poor Modi’s history is. He has been under severe criticism for same many times. This time his lack of history knowledge proved costly for me too. Yeh toh wohi baat hui na ji, ki hum toh dubenge hi tumko bhi le dubenge,” Kejriwal went on to add.

Kejriwal however accepted that being an RTI activist himself, he knew how endangered their lives were and thought Modi must be right and all of them must have been murdered by goons.

“And everyone knows that I believe in internet, so I went with Modi’s mail and made the blunder,” Kejriwal further added.

When asked to show the proof of the email sent by Modi, Kejriwal first insisted that a word by an honest person like him should be enough. But when persisted he claimed he trashed it after confusing it for another spam mail from Somnath Bharti.

Meanwhile AAP supporters hailed Kejriwal on Social Media for showing guts to accept his mistake and attacked Modi for his malicious attempt to defame their leader.

Arvind Kejriwal, who reached Gujarat to verify the pictures of Modi ruled state that he saw on Facebook, was hugely disappointed when he found a decent looking Indian metro city instead of New York.

“All of Modi claims are false, there is no development at all in Gujarat. Yesterday, I spent 8 hours of my free time searching for Manhattan in Ahmedabad, where is it? There were only 14-15 storied buildings, not even a single 101 storied building was there. Yahi to scam hai, isi ki to jaanch karni hai,” asserted a disheartened Kejriwal.

Underdeveloped city

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Chief Minister further claimed that he was shocked to see even weather of Gujarat much different from that of New York.

“It’s freezing cold in New York, so I had brought my muffler with me. But surprisingly, temperature here is 32 degrees. Dhokha hua ji aam aadmi ke saath,” Arvind told Faking News.

One of the AAP members, who is accompanying Kejriwal on Gujarat trip, says that like any other common man, AAP chief is also a firm believer of whatever he sees on internet.

“Of late, he has relied upon Facebook and Twitter to gather corruption proofs against top corporate bigwigs and politicians,” the AAP member revealed.

Reportedly, while roaming around in a remote part of Gujarat, Kejriwal thought to take rest on a footpath of a 4 lane highway and he sat down there in full view of media persons.

But to his surprise, some dirt stuck to his trousers exposing the hollow truth of world class road and infrastructure pasted on Facebook by Modi supporters.

Later, he visited a nearby village and found a household using 60 watt tungsten bulb. “That villager wasn’t rich enough to buy a philips CFL. Such widespread poverty turned out to be the final blow which broke Kejriwal’s patience,” disclosed an AAP insider.

Soon after that, Kejriwal declared Modi’s Gujarat model flawed.

A 26-year-old hardcore AAP supporter today broke up with his wife after he caught her in an uncompromising position (eyes riveted on screen) watching Narendra Modi’s rally on TV.

The sight of her enjoying Modi’s speech angered him so much that he immediately asked her to get out of his house, only to later realize that the house was jointly owned by them. Arvind fell short of calling his wife ‘Ambani agent’.

Arvind Sisodia’s friends confirm that there have been many instances in the past when he had more definite reasons to break up with her, but somehow he chose to end the relationship when it came to Modi.

“He was not upset when she flirted with me, or when she failed to wish him on his birthday,” revealed Vijay Kumar, one of the friends of Arvind.

But his wife taking keen interest in Modi provoked Arvind no end, and he decided to call it quits.

Sources say that earlier Arvind Sisodia had gone on a 4-hour fact finding visit to his in-law’s home to verify the claims of his wife that her mayka was the best.

“First of all there is nobody named ‘Vikas’ in her house. She said her house was clean. But I found lot of garbage in their dustbin. She said her father is retired. Then from where did he get a car and scooter to travel in?” Arvind claimed.

When asked how did such things matter in a relationship, the AAP supporter claimed that integrity in life was the most important thing. When this reporter persisted, Arvind claimed that he didn’t even find any proof of love and care in his wife’s mayka.

“She said her parents were in love, but I saw my saas cribbing about my sasur‘s snoring habits,” Arvind disclosed the lack of love he found, “kaun sa pyaar? mujhe toh kahin pyaar nahi dikha. phir yeh kya pyaar karegi?”

Soon after announcing 9 phase Lok Sabha elections schedule, Election Commission of India has requested people not to forget whom they voted for by the time of election results.

“We know that the duration is quite long. I mean long enough for people who will be voting in first phase to forget about their choice of candidate by time of results. That’s why we are advising people to note it down somewhere so that they don’t get confused on result day,” explained Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath.

Write name of the party you voted for behind voter-id card.

“We don’t want them cribbing on the results day that they voted for party X, but party Y won, and thus alleging rigging of the EVMs,” added Mr. Sampath.

Experts are afraid that if appropriate measures are not taken by people, country may witness one the most confused election results day in the history of democracy.

Election Commission has even promised for an emergency helpline number on the results day. “On 16th May, people who would be completely clueless about their candidate selection can call and ask name of party whom they voted for,” said an EC official, “Yes, it violates the secret ballot process, but we don’t want problems thereafter.”

However, many people with weak memories are seeing this prolonged election process as a blessing in disguise. “I will celebrate for the winning party, assuming that I had voted for them,” quipped 70-year-old Madan Khurana, a Delhiite, who will be voting in the first phase.

But surprisingly, most of the political parties are not worried at all.

“The most important thing is to vote. So what if they forget whom they voted for. Even we forget lofty promises that we make during campaigns. There is nothing wrong in this,” said RJD chief Lalu Yadav, motivating people with weak memories, “Do your work without worrying for fruits. Neki kar dariya mein daal.”

Sources tell Faking News that the incident happened last week, but days after found missing, 6 of them returned with Lalu to his cowshed.

Last week, it was a normal weekend trip for Lalu to his cowsheds, when the caretaker of the shed appeared pale and confused. After blaming communal forces for his troubles, Ram Singh, the caretaker, finally broke down and revealed to Lalu that 13 cows were missing for the past 3 days.

Lalu Yadav checking his cows

Lalu is reported to have said “Bhat Day Buck” before realizing that Ram Singh was telling the truth. He immediately checked the remaining cows and made a list of those missing.

After three days of frantic searching, the cows were found to be with Azam Khan, the world famous bovine lover.

Initially, Lalu was too furious with Azam and wanted to convene a press meet to blast him left right and center. However, to save his secular image and to stop communal forces from coming to power, Lalu decided to underplay the law and order situation in Uttar Pradeh.

When this correspondent got in touch with Azam Khan, and asked how did Lalu’s cows land in his cowshed, he said, “This is all ploy and propaganda of Amit Shah and Modi. They are trying to create rift between people of different religions.”

However, this correspondent braved himself into the secret cowshed and interviewed the 7 dissident cows who didn’t return with Lalu.

Sam, leader of the resistance, said, “We are still not getting enough fodder even though we saw invoices raised to buy enough fodder. Also, the air-conditioner was not working properly. One day we read about Azam Khan sahab using police to search for his missing buffaloes. We decided to join him. We are with him. Mooooo!” And the rest of the cows mooed in unison.

Our Bihar reporter interviewed the returned cows. Siddi, the leader of the returned cows, said, “This is a cowspiracy by the Nitish Kumar. We were told by state authorities that we are being shifted to a new cowshed and that Sam urged us to leave our Laluji. But, when we ended up in Azam’s shed, we realized it was a plot by several forces against Lalu ji. Now we are back to being what we were; Lalu’s pets.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LaluCow.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/13-cows-desert-lalu-yadav-for-azam-khan-6-return-days-later-4786,"13 cows desert Lalu Yadav for Azam Khan, 6 return days later",,1393845399.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After continuously fumbling with historical facts, latest being the suggestion that Bhagat Singh and friends were jailed in Andaman-Nicobar islands, it has been now found that BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi lacks knowledge about chemistry too.

The truth came out when Modi, while addressing students pursuing graduation in Delhi University, erred in his knowledge about chemical composition of alcohol.

Modi wondering over the chemical locha

While talking passionately about the progress in Gujarat, Modi explained why alcohol is banned there.

“It was not me who has banned alcohol,” Modi said as bewadas Bachelors of Science students cheered, “Gujarat has been a dry state since long to pay tribute to Gandhiji.”

“We Gujaratis are comfortable with meetha, not methanol,” he added, trying to impress students by talking in their language and by using alliteration, but this statement caused a huge controversy exposing Modi’s lack of chemistry knowledge.

“Methanol is not the alcohol we drink, it’s ethanol,” pointed out many experts, many of whom became expert on chemical names only after Modi made the gaffe.

“Methanol is poisonous alcohol, but no wonder Modi talks about it instead of ethanol. What a poisonous mind! Fascist streaks exposed!” claimed a leading journalist.

Not only journalists and experts, political parties too criticized Modi for having such abysmal level of knowledge.

“It is disgraceful that an aspiring PM doesn’t have sound knowledge about Chemistry, which is very vital to be a good PM. And this, after he himself claimed few days back that 2014 polls will be all about chemistry and not mathematics. Shameful!” read the joint statement issued by Congress, AAP and all other secular parties.

“You would be amazed to know the command Rahul Gandhi Ji has over Chemistry. He knows chemical formulas of all the elements and compounds by heart. He invented periodic table,” Sanjay Jha told Faking News.

“Moody sud know tht menthol is wrong and ethenaul is the write answer. Kejariwal knows best kemistry.” read one of the tweets by AAP leader Ashutosh.

But BJP leaders downplayed the issue and claimed that it was not Modi but UPA government that was weak in Chemistry.

A day after Rahul Gandhi was showered with kisses by women in Assam, mosquitoes from Bundelkhand area of Madhya Pradesh have clarified that back in 2008 they too were kissing the Congress Vice President – a compassionate act that Rahul confused for malicious attack.

“Our intention was to kiss Rahul Gandhi, not to harm him. He misinterpreted our love and affection,” said Lui Singh, head of Bundelkhand Mosquito Sangh.

Lui Singh was speaking on behalf of the families and descendants of those 25,000 mosquitoes, who were accused of attacking Rahul Gandhi and spoiling his tour.

Rahul Gandhi being kissed by human beings

“There was a deliberate confusion created by media about the kisses,” Lui Singh further explained, “Those were female mosquitoes who were kissing Rahul Gandhi. But since science textbooks have spread this sexist prejudice about female mosquitoes that only they bite human beings, the kisses were confused as bites.”

“If Rahul baba felt nauseated or feverish, it might be due to other factors, not due to our kisses,” the head of Bundelkhand Mosquito Sangh claimed.

“I mean, Digvijay Singh or something. But not us,” Lui added.

Congress sources tell Faking News that the clarification by the mosquitoes has won Rahul Gandhi’s heart, and he has forgiven them.

“On behalf of Congress, I invite them to join our party. Considering their huge network, I hope they will be very helpful in spreading Congress’ buzz across whole India,” Rahul Gandhi later issued a formal statement.

“We also aim to empower them,” Rahul Gandhi promised.

On cue with Rahul’s response, Bundelkhand’s local Congress workers, who were in state of enmity with the local mosquitoes after the 2008 incident, have invited the mosquitoes for a grand dinner at party office that will empower them by removing their hunger.

“Each of us will donate 20 ml of our blood for the dinner,” promised a Congress member, “If my blood helps the party and Rahul Gandhi ji, I will be the happiest person.”

“This is another jewel in crown of our charismatic leader Rahul Gandhi. Insaanon ko chhodo, hindustan ka machhar machhar Rahul Ji ka deewana hai,” Congress leader Rajeev Shukla expressed his happiness over the development.

Shukla further claimed that the incident proved that there was a huge wave in support of Congress in the country.

“These mosquitoes were part of BJP earlier and had joined the party after Narendra Modi had congratulated them on biting Rahul ji,” Shukla claimed while talking to media, “So this should be seen as thousands of BJP supporters deserting BJP to join Congress.”

Sources say that Congress is planning to use mosquitoes as brand ambassadors and spokespersons too.

“Each mosquito bite should be seen as a kiss – jan jan ko chhua, jan jivan badla,” a Congress leader said. The leader requested the party high command to pass orders for creating environment that promotes mosquitoes’ breeding.

Meanwhile, fumed over Congress-mosquitoes alliance, BJP has vowed to kill all the mosquitoes in all the states ruled by them.

“What can one expect from the party of mass murderers?” Congress leaders Salman Khurshid and Mani Shankar Aiyar released a joint statement, which overshadowed Rahul Gandhi’s statement of pardoning the mosquitoes.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rahul-kissing.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mosquitoes-from-mp-clarify-that-they-were-kissing-rahul-gandhi-in-2008-4758,Mosquitoes from MP clarify that they were kissing Rahul Gandhi in 2008,,1393501527.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The young and dynamic leader of Congress, Rahul Gandhi, in an effort to revamp the face of the Party, has announced plans to change the party symbol. The earlier open palm will now close its fingers to form a clenched fist.

Rahul claimed that a clenched fist will symbolize his the party’s primary, or even the solitary agenda of empowerment, and help it in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

“A clenched fist symbolizes power, which we want to give to the people of this country. An open palm shows helplessness. I don’t know why it was our party’s symbol for so many years to begin with,” Rahul told Faking News.

The new symbol of Congress.

Dr. Manmohan Singh also extended full support to this decision by nodding. Party leaders say that his closed mouth was an experiment by Rahul Gandhi to check if closed hand was a better idea.

“The closed mouth did wonders in cases of corruption, so Rahul baba became confident and more resolute to get the palm closed,” a party source revealed.

When asked if this major decision was to justify the recent enlightening interview with Arnab Goswami, Rahul denied the allegation, saying he planned to empower even Arnab Goswami with more on-air time on The Newshour.

The decision has started attracting political reactions. RJD, the most loyal ally of Congress, was first to welcome the decision.

“This symbolizes Congress and RJD coming together,” RJD chief Lalu Yadav said, “You need to close your fingers into a fist if you want to milk a cow. Now we are ready to milk the electoral benefits.”

Left parties mocked Congress for using an imagery that is often associated with leftist revolutions, while Mamata Banerjee claimed that Congress was threatening her with such gestures.

BJP claimed that Congress had shown its true colors and it was now close to holding the broom, the election symbol of AAP.

However, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rubbished such comments. He claimed that the change in the symbol symbolized making corruption an integral part of the Congress Party, because a closed hand, according to him, hides whatever is in the hand, which obviously would be money.

For secularism and to get even with the BJP, Kejriwal quickly added that the changed symbol of Congress also proved that Congress and BJP were bhai-bhai.

“Lotus also has closed petals and there is something hidden there,” Kejriwal explained and left the press conference when asked if broom too had something hidden between the straws.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fist-222x300.png,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-planning-to-change-party-symbol-to-fist-to-symbolize-empowerment-4743,Rahul Gandhi planning to change party symbol to fist to symbolize empowerment,,1393408847.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Immediately after it came to Salman’s knowledge that his effigies are being burnt by Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP workers in Patna, for flying kites and having lunch with Narendra Modi, the actor decided to make amends for it by organizing a large iftar party and inviting Paswan.

“Salman is very generous guy. He just wants to be good with everyone out there,” said Arbaz refusing to admit it as merely a damage control exercise.

Scenes from rehearsal.

This party is being planned for sometime next month so that it presents Paswan with perfect opportunity to meet and promote himself among large number of muslims (who are expected to turn up) before elections.

“Salman Bhai knows the importance of Iftar parties. He has often used them as platform to reconcile with old enemies,” Shera, Salman’s bodyguard revealed.

According to sources renowned peacemaker Baba Siddique has already been hired by bhai and rehearsals are going on at full swing at Galaxy Apartments daily to make it look like a perfect chance encounter lest some other party gets upset and calls it a pre planned event.

If this doesn’t convince Paswan, Salman is even willing to endorse him the way he endorsed Modi. “We can have 2 prime ministers, one for entire India and another for minority community,” he is believed to have argued.

“Do you think Bhai’s fans give a damn to all this?” shot back Shera when pointed out that Eid is due for July and Salman is having Iftar 5 months in advance.

“If bhai is organizing Iftar in february then calendar must be wrong not bhai,” said an autowala who is a huge fan of Salman.

If reports are to be believed earlier Salman was thinking of dressing up like Osama bin laden to help Paswan recreate the magic that he had tired a few years ago. But political advisers of Paswan told him that Osama is long dead and instead of attracting muslims he would end up shooing away and scaring them.

Meanwhile LJP workers have been hit hard by this development which has made them clueless as to whose effigies to burn next.

Facing flak for terming the observation of court as ‘completely wrong‘ in indicting Somnath Bharti for tampering with evidence, Arvind Kejriwal has now asked the concerned court to submit whatever proof they have against the law minister of Delhi.

Kejriwal called Somnath innocent till proven guilty innocent by Internal Lokpal.

The court and the concerned judge are supposed to submit the proof to the Government of Delhi. These proofs will then be evaluated by an internal Lokpal appointed by AAP.

The decision was taken after few of the enraged AAP members and volunteers were already on their way to gather newspaper clippings to prove how the special judge of CBI was corrupt and possibly even a BJP agent.

“Eventually better sense prevailed,” claimed a member who wasn’t Vinod Binny.

“Yes we have set up our own Lokpal as you simply can’t trust anyone on such issues. You never know they could make politically motivated charges,” argued Yogendra Yadav, who has urged judge to submit the raw format of the proof as well.

Sources say that Prashant Bhushan had earlier proposed a referendum to overrule the observations of the court, but his personal opinions were put on hold as a tried and tested method of internal Lokpal was already there.

Confirming the development, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal further declared that only after Somnath is found guilty by the internal Lokpal, will they be convinced of the court’s observation and not question it.

If reports are to be believed, AAP was initially shocked with Bharti’s indictment by court as they had not thought that Indian law also had provisions to go beyond allegations.

“We were totally unaware of the procedure. We seriously thought alleging and accusing is the end of it and felt that character assassination and tarnishing of reputation of the accused that follows is the real punishment,” an AAP activist told Faking News on Twitter.

The AAP fan further claimed it to be the precise reason why Delhi government didn’t initiate any inquiry against Sheila Dixit after coming to power.

“But now that it has come to our knowledge that one has to be tried in court of law with proper evidence, we have decided to look into it and do it in our own court,” the AAP fan with Arvind Kejriwal DP declared.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/M_Id_456213_Arvind_Keijriwal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-asks-judge-to-submit-proof-against-somnath-bharti-will-be-tried-by-internal-lokpal-4480,"Kejriwal asks judge to submit proof against Somnath Bharti, will be tried by internal lokpal",,1389778176.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After disclosing that Arvind Kejriwal was being provided security cover without his knowledge, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today claimed that the central government did a whole lot of good things for India and its people which they have no knowledge about.

According to him, the UPA-II has been working on a mission to do things that are good and secret in nature e.g. development and security.

Shinde tried best to talk to media without their knowledge but failed.

“This was being done as it was the duty of the government to carry out good governance,” he said.

“It is just not in our nature to do good work and then go on boasting about it in rallies like Mr Feku. We are humble that way. We like to talk about minorities and dalits there, who have benefited due to our schemes without their knowledge,” Shinde said, without repeating.

“We are firm believers of a saying by a Sufi saint karm kiye ja fal ki chinta na kar,” he explained. When this Faking News reporter pointed out that it was a quote attributed to Lord Krishna, he asked us to be careful and give credit to minorities too.

“Do you think without our outside support AAP would have been able to form government in Delhi?” Shinde shot back when prodded with with questions to mention at least one good thing (according to him) that they did.

He further claimed that the government’s approach of doing things without the knowledge of targeted groups was extended to the government itself. He revealed that all the scams that took place under UPA’s nose took place without government’s knowledge.

“However, once we came to know about the scams, we decided not to stop them.

Anil Adarsh, a young executive who had been working his arse off in a software services company, today joined Deshbhakt Aadmi Party (DAP) to work his arse off in a mass movement.

Anil was disillusioned with corporate life where he used to work hard day in and day out, and his boss used to get all the credit and promotions to get ahead in corporate life.

Anil is hopeful of bringing change

Now he will work hard day in and day out and help the leaders of DAP get ahead in public life.

However, Anil insists that there is a qualitative difference.

“I will not take any salary. I am not doing it for money,” he explained.

Dhiraj Prasad, now the ex-boss of Anil, has accepted the 26-year-old executive’s resignation and has wished him all the best in this career move.

“I didn’t know that salary part was hurting him so much,” he told Faking News, “If his idea was to work without any salary, we could have stopped paying him any salary long back.”

Anil reiterated that guys like Harendra and this reporter will not get it.

“It’s different,” he said about Deshbhakt Aadmi Party, “I will be working for the betterment of the society. I will be part of a revolution. It’s not about my future; it’s about future of the country.”

Anil hopes to use his skills to spread the message of DAP among his social circle and inspire more people to join the movement.

When asked how was he so sure about integrity and motives of people he would be working for, he said, “These people are good.”

Anil is confident that this new phase in his life will not be as banal as boring as earlier.

Meanwhile sources say that Dhiraj Prasad, the boss, is also planning to join DAP after a few weeks.

Shocked by results of the recent survey conducted by TOI across 8 metro cities in India where a staggering 14% of people still think Rahul Gandhi would be best suited for Prime Ministerial position, an activist group from capital yesterday filed an RTI to know the names of those people.

The group said they wanted to make sure the results of survey were not fudged and were not unfairly favoring any particular party or candidate.

Rahul’s response when asked what percentage of people will he ensure vote for him by elections.

According to the group at a point when even Congress is not sure if it should project Rahul Gandhi as their PM candidate or go for Arvind Kejriwal Priyanka or somebody else instead, it was baffling for them to see people still seeing some hope in the Gandhi scion.

“Are these guys aliens who have just landed in India or blind like supporters of a self declared honest party?” a member of the group wondered.

The group further wanted to clear their doubts if the participants were drunk or were just pulling Rahul Gandhi’s leg just the way Manmohan Singh does when he time and again says he wants to work under Rahul’s leadership.

“And since nobody is going to admit as it carries risk of being labelled dumb and being outcast from the society, we had to choose this route,” the memeber further explained.

While the findings are still being collated, whatever little the group shared with Faking News points at a larger conspiracy.

According to findings, senior party members Rajiv Shukla, Digvijay Singh and Salman Khurshid are among few others whose name has been found to be among those who voted for Rahul. But what is more shocking is that these guys were able to vote from 6 out 8 cities surveyed.

On further investigating it was found that Congress high command had the itinerary of the places and timing where survey was going to be held beforehand and had accordingly asked its members to be on high alert and make their presence felt wherever possible.

Following the orders those 3 leaders decided to take up the challenge on a war footing.

As per sources after voting for Rahul Gandhi in Delhi, Rajiv Shukla took a flight to Mumbai voted for him there, then took a bus to reach Pune, voted there, then flew down to Kolkata, Bangalore and Chennai to express his opinion.

Similarly other leaders also disguised their look and planned their day.

Later Faking News tried to reach Rajiv Shukla at AIIMS hospital where he was forcefully admitted after signs of severe exhaustion and is now on a glucose drip.

He was furious as doctors didn’t let him cover Hyderabad and Ahmedabad which severely impacted the outcome in those cities with meager 8% and 5% wanting Rahul as PM.

“My life is not more important than Rahul Gandhi ji,” he was constantly saying.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-resigns-from-aap-to-join-aap-again-so-that-it-makes-news-4444,"New Delhi. After watching the kind of media coverage and importance these new joinees of Aam Aadmi Party are getting, an old worker of the party has decided to resign only to rejoin it later, so that even he makes news and gets the position he thinks he deserves.

He wishes to be the next cause of it.

“It has become a fad nowadays. Earlier this craze was about IIT or IIM placements, now it’s all about getting placed in AAP. People think joining the party gives them certificate of integrity,” the leader lashed out at the recent joinees and media, and warned if the trend continues we could soon see Sharad Pawar or Kalmadi joining it.

The party worker reportedly took this decision after somebody from media who had come to cover news of these new people joining AAP yesterday at their Kaushambi office asked him “Kaka yeh party ke saab log kahaan baithte hain?” He got so enraged that not only did he resign immediately, but also gave him address of the BJP office in the vicinity.

“Saala, I was one first few ones to join AAP. I earned my place by struggling during our Jantar Mantar days, was part of the hunger strike, took lathis on me the marks of which still remain, got drowned in the water cannon and even went to jail on one occasion. But now any aera gaera naththu khaira is joining the party without having to go through all of this and is becoming more famous than us,” revealed the worker without confirming whom he was hinting at.

“Even I should have enjoyed my life and waited till results of Delhi assembly elections before taking the leap,” he quickly added regretting his decisions.

The man is further hopeful of getting senior and important roles in the party once he rejoins.

“The same way a professional leaves a company, goes to another company, and comes back to the original company to get a senior role,” said the man who now wants to make full use of the opportunity he lost earlier

“Who knows they could even make me the PM candidate?” he added.

Meanwhile AAP leaders, wary of people/celebs using it as a platform to get publicity and get into limelight, have decided to introduce entrance exams to tackle the high number of requests they are receiving on hourly basis. This exam will test how much a person is Aam Aadmi at heart and will ensure that those joining have pure intentions even if they lack knowledge of governance.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Breaking-News.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-resigns-from-aap-to-join-aap-again-so-that-it-makes-news-4444,"Man resigns from AAP to join it later, so that it makes news",,1389260748.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-image-improvement-4423,"Congress has hired Japanese Advertising and Public Relations firm Dentsu to boost image of Rahul Gandhi ahead of the general elections this year. Faking News has found out some steps that the ad agency is planning to take to produce this miracle:

1. The PR firm is trying to get second season of “Satyameva Jayate” on with Rahul Gandhi in place of Aamir Khan. Rahul Gandhi is being trained to feel sad and cry; Aamir Khan and Sonia Gandhi are reported to be the chief trainers. Agency feels that this will showcase the “soft” aspect of Rahul’s personality and could impress the viewers, because the “hard” aspects of the personality – like tearing away ordinance and shouting angrily in rallies – have failed to impress the common man. Earlier, the concept of a new TV shows titled “Ganna with Gandhi” on lines of “Koffee with Karan” was rejected by the agency.

An improved image?

2. After Rahul’s “ISI recruiting riot victims” statement appeared like being not too far from the reality, Denstsu has decided to prove his other seemingly absurd statements true. For example:

(i) India is a beehive: For this, the agency has decided to plant beehives in every nook and corner of country with the help of Ahmed Patel who is quite experienced when it comes to ‘planting’ stuff. Bees are being imported from across the world to make sure the numbers don’t fall short.

(ii) Poverty is a state of mind: Here Robert Vadra’s example is being quoted to prove the statement indeed had some weight. The fact that Robert Vadra, despite being a small farmer, manages to remain so happy and wealthy looking, is being highlighted.

3. Aam Aadmi support: Modi is not the only threat Dentsu has assessed. Arvind Kejriwal, though now a bit soft on Congress after forming government in Delhi, has also been identified as a threat. Apart from highlighting the 11 things that Rahul Gandhi did before AAP repeated them, the agency has asked Rahul Gandhi to continue what he has been doing i.e. opposing the policies of UPA government in personal capacity.

4. De-Digvijayfication: Sources tell Faking News that Denstu has specifically asked Congress high command to stop Digvijay Singh from praising Rahul Gandhi. They have instead asked Digvijay Singh to start praising Narendra Modi. Sources claim that recent statements of Digvijay Singh praising Arvind Kejriwal is beta version of the same strategy.

5. Follow Modi’s Gujarat promotional model: Like Modi, who mentions Gujarat’s progress in his rallies, Rahul has been asked to quote examples of his achievements in Amethi. For this, extensive R&D is being done to come up with at least 1-2 such instances. Rahul’s idea of Amethi being above the national average when it comes to dreaming has been rejected.

6. Alok Nath’s endorsement and aashirwaad: Talks are also on to make Alok Nath endorse the Gandhi scion and bless him. They are also requesting him to proclaim Rahul as the most sanskaari boy, to whom Babuji would love to marry off his daughters.

7. Social media: the agency has decided to make Rahul Gandhi follow every damn guy and girl on Twitter and reply with “Epic!” to any of their tweets. This will make Rahul Gandhi a valuable asset (a follower who is always praising you) for the youth and they will feel obliged to do the same to Rahul. Similarly, Rahul will add everyone on Facebook and “like” their status updates even if it is as banal as “brushed my teeth with shampoo today. lol!”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Rahul-Gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-image-improvement-4423,7 steps Dentsu will take to improve Rahul Gandhi’s image,,1389092570.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The original Mango Man of the Banana Republic has decided that he cannot bank on laws & in-laws anymore. In his bid to redeem himself he has decided to launch ‘Banana Aadmi Party’, fight election against AAP, and later offer unconditional support to them.

BAP’s party symbol.

We asked what prompted him to come up with this idea, Vadra philosophically said, “Sari khudai ek taraf aur biwi ka bhai ek taraf. When whole world wassuggesting me to make peace with Kejriwal and Khemka, I did not listen. But after Delhi results when Rahul Gandhi said ‘We need to learn from Kejriwal‘ it struck the right chords in my mind in a manner that you can’t even imagine. People had even started talking that Kejriwal is the son Sonia always wanted. So I feared that if Kejriwal can become the son she wanted, somebody else will become the son-in-law she needed. I will not let Gandhi-Vadra family down so easily!”

On the weird choice of party name, Vadra clarified, “Being a farmer myself, I always keep dreaming when my investments will bear fruits. The king of fruits, Mango (Aam) is already taken by Kejriwal, so I settled for Banana. Politics is all about ‘Aam aadmi ko ullu Banana’. Kejri has started and I will finish.”

Faking News reporter Shaitaan Khopdi™ asked what would be his agenda for the polls; Vadra replied, “Naturally I will fight for against Corruption! I am going to take up Ashok Khemka’s case. Honest IAS officers with initials as AK are the flavor of the season. If Kejriwal can be CM, why Khemka has not got his due? I will tear up the chargesheet filed by Haryana government in full media view. This is another trick I learned from Rahul.”

“The rampant corruption is evident when you hear people say ‘Aam ke aam, Guthliyon ke daam’. I demand that Guthli should be auctioned just like Coal mines and Spectrum. Where is CAG when poor farmers need them?” Vadra launched his political campaign.

When Faking News reminded him that Khemka might not come together with him, he had his answer ready, “Even Anna doesn’t share stage with Kejri, does it make any difference to AAP?”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Banana.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-launches-bap-banana-aadmi-party-4421,Robert Vadra launches BAP (Banana Aadmi Party),,1389027294.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After deciding to drop charges against Muslim leaders accused of riots in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh’s Akhilesh Yadav government has now gone a step ahead and decided to issue “Riot Cards” on the line of “Aadhar Cards” to people in the state.

Anyone holding a valid riot card would be entitled to riot and create havoc at will during periods of communal tension. Card holders would have the license to provoke the masses, assemble with arms, and even kill a few people; without worrying about getting harassed by the law later.

The father-son duo announcing their decision in a secular manner.

“It was getting too problematic to manage issues post riots. First Supreme Court asked us to withdraw help given only to Muslims, and now there is hue and cry over our decision to drop charges against Muslim leaders,” UP Home Secretary told Faking News why the decision was taken.

Sources from Samajwadi Party confirm that there would be reservations on religious lines while issuing the cards, with up to 85% of these cards being reserved for people belonging to the minority community.

“Our Muslim brothers and sisters have long been ignored and suffered a lot. It is a small step in the direction of our endeavor to uplift them and boost their confidence and faith in the system,” UP CM Akhilesh explained while signing on the government orders to bulldoze all the remaining relief camps in Muzaffarnagar.

Samajwadi Party is confident that this step will help them win back support of Muslim community in the state, which some experts thought had weakened after the Muzaffarnagar riots.

“It will also defeat the communal forces,” Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav claimed.

However, Congress has accused SP of fooling Muslims.

“These cards will be termed unconstitutional by courts as reservations on religious lines have been rejected earlier. We have to make constitutional changes that allow such cards and the right to riot for the minority community, which has already been promised by the Congress party through the Communal Violence Bill,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mulayam_mwn3.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-govt-to-issue-riot-card-only-those-with-valid-cards-can-riot-4417,"UP govt to issue “Riot Card”, only those with valid cards may riot",,1389001234.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

BJP today sent a CD containing speeches of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as a proof of corruption by former Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dixit. Earlier in a press conference, Kejriwal had asked BJP leader Dr. Harshvardhan to send him proof of Sheila Dixit being involved in various scams.

According to reports, Kejriwal initially refused to accept the CD as he claimed that Dr. Harshvardhan was insulting the aam aadmi by acting in a privileged manner.

Arvind Kejriwal recalls his earlier statements as India Against Corruption member

“He may be the leader of opposition, but he should act as an aam aadmi. He should wait till we announce the hotline number to report corruption,” the Delhi CM is reported to have said.

Kejriwal is further reported to have argued that the real Chief Minister of Delhi were the 1.8 crore more aam aadmis, and thus the CD should be delivered to all of them if BJP wanted to directly reach the Chief Minister.

However, he quickly added that he was not going soft on Sheila Dixit post the election victory, and he will definitely take up the issue.

“If required, we will conduct mohalla sabhas and seek referendum of people to decide what needs to be done with the former Delhi CM,” he said.

“See, even if it is me in the videos, it cannot be taken at face value as what ultimately matters is what the janta feels about Sheila ji,” he explained.

When this Faking News reporter asked him if he saw the video clips and what he thought about his own earlier statements, Delhi Chief Minister claimed that “no corrupt one will be left unpunished” and left because he had some important work to do like giving subsidy relief to the aam aadmi.

Faking News then got in touch with Yogendra Yadav to get his opinion. After watching the clip, he felt that the person in the video resembled Kejriwal but the content of the CD needed to be audited in order to come to a conclusion.

“We have earlier been a victim of a fake sting operation so we can’t blindly believe what we see,” the party strategist said, “Further, you have to see everything in a context. Those direct attacks on Sheila Dixit were at a time when they were necessary for political revolution, now the situation has changed.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Arvind-Kejriwal.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kejriwal-asks-for-proof-against-sheila-dixit-bjp-gives-cd-of-his-own-speeches-4411,"Kejriwal asks for proof against Sheila Dixit, BJP gives CD of his own speeches",,1388741232.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Continuing with their pro-aam aadmi policies that are going to erase corruption from the National Capital Region, AAP government today announced that a person won’t need to pay anything if he’s traveling short distance by Delhi Metro.

“This is in line with free water or cheaper electricity bill up to a certain limit,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal explained, “Now you don’t need to pay anything if you are not traveling beyond 3 stations.”

The symbol of development of Delhi will follow the policies of the government of the day

When asked if this won’t hurt the revenues of DMRC, Chief Minister said that DMRC has enough money and this much of burden can be easily absorbed by the corporation.

“They even have made video clips of couples getting intimate in Delhi Metro coaches. They must have made money selling those clips on various websites. We will get their books audited as we suspect they are making more money than reported,” the youngest Chief Minister of Delhi claimed.

Sources tell Faking News that Delhi government is thinking of approaching CAG to get the account books of DMRC audited.

“Many people had earlier claimed that their Metro smartcards were being charged more than the distance covered. We feel there are many irregularities,” revealed a government source why it was so important to make short distance metro travel free.

The announcement has been welcomed by many experts and journalists, who feel that this will encourage people to travel shorter distance and hence rush in Metro, another major problem faced by Delhi residents, will be eased.

When this reporter wondered if this won’t encourage behavior where people get down after 3 Metro stations and start a new journey for the next 3 stations, AAP strategists and supporters rejected such thoughts as “evil” and “cynical”. Some even called it “paid”.

Meanwhile the aam aadmi of Delhi has welcomed yet another relief and is hoping that traveling by DTC buses would also be made free.

“Also, if they can make the first two traffic offences penalty free, traveling on roads will be so aam aadmi friendly,” said Amit, a Delhi resident who jumped a red light but was caught by a traffic policeman. Both Amit and the policeman were confused how to settle the matter in an “honest” way.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/standard-poors-mulls-rating-indian-politicians-4375,"Sensing a huge market opportunity presented by the recent Delhi elections, S&P has decided to launch its unique pioneering rating agency for politicians in India.

Hope S&P doesn’t go Taran Adarsh’s way.

Now voters can have a choice between a AAA rated candidate (who swears by clean governance) and another junk status candidate having a BBB-rating (who offers a bottle of country liquor for your vote).

Arvind Kejriwal is being roped in as the brand ambassador and along with Anna Hazare will also double up as a consultant to S&P for this business.

A candidate’s overall rating shall be determined after evaluating him on various parameters like degree of dishonesty, level of corruption exhibited, public image and effective administration.

“A rated candidate will have a higher chance of winning than a non –rated one,” said Brian McMillan of S&P while talking to Faking News.

Aspiring candidates from various political parties are likely to queue up before the rating agency for presenting their case for a higher rating.

“Involvement in a scam like Coalgate or 2G will result into a significant downgrade overnight from AAA to BBB or C depending upon the size of the scam,” commented a political big-wig familiar with many scams

It is expected that in due course, by 2019, election commission shall make it mandatory for all candidates to be rated by a duly accredited agency. After S&P, KPMG and Moody’s are also likely to jump into this business shortly.

Congress is contemplating an in house rating agency headed by Sonia ji while other leading national political parties including BJP and the Left have already created infrastructure within their parties to help their candidates with preparation of application for getting rated.

On the other hand many parties mainly from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand have contended that the rate of a MP is a better evaluation than a rating. Samajwadi Party and BSP in a joint representation to EC have rubbished the very idea of ratings in toto.

“We shall field those nominated by Rahulji.

Fearing that all the exposes and protests that they excel at and are so used to doing would soon become a thing of past, AAP has decided to include their continuity as the last and final condition in front of Congress before they agree to form a government in the city.

Both Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwaas signalling number of demands they would make after this.

“It is our forte and something for which people of Delhi have reposed their faith in us. Therefore we cannot stop doing it,” Arvind Kejriwal confirmed at a media gathering.

“We are still unsure whether to expose our own Govt or the opposition after coming to power. To solve that confusion, Yogendra Yadav ji is already conducting internal surveys,” Kejriwal further added.

Sources say as soon as Delhi elections results came out in open, there was joy as well as a tinge of sadness in the AAP camp. They became nostalgic and started crying like a student whose last day in a carefree college life has ended and is now staring at a life full of responsibility and accountability.

“It was all fun while it lasted. Those shocking revelations, all round allegations, complaints with the system; those were the best days of our life, back in the summer of three plus nine (2012),” said Kumar Vishwaas in his inimitable style albeit in English.

The news from Congress camp is that it has agreed to the demand in unequivocal terms. “We are so used to the exposes and protests done by AAP now that some of our leaders had already started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms ever since our government was defeated in capital. We look forward to getting exposed again by AAP under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi ji,” Ahmed Patel told Faking News.

However this latest acceptance of their demand has created panic in AAP camp and they have hired IIM pass outs to help them put up a demand that Congress will never agree upon.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"New Delhi. In a major decision which is going to change the way people look at natural resources, Government of India has declared ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ a natural resource and has created rules to regulate its usage like any other natural resources.

Government’s initiative is inspired from a report published by a leading investment bank which points out recent events where ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ yielded huge profits for people involved.

AAP – One of the top gainers.

Be it Chennai Express’ box office performance or AAP’s grand debut in Delhi elections, both have a ‘Aam Aadmi’ connection. While the former capitalized on famous dialogue ‘Dont Underestimate The Power Of A Common Man’, the latter’s whole agenda was around Aam Aadmi and even Salman’s coming movie ‘Jai Ho’ is using a ‘Aam Aadmi’ centric dialogue in its trailer, says the report explaining business potential of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.

“It’s a good opportunity for government to generate some extra revenue. We have already witnessed its power and can’t distribute it for free. And above all it’s a renewable source,” told Kapil Sibal while talking to media at a press conference.

“From now on, people using the term ‘Aam Aadmi’ for their personal benefit must pay accordingly,” Sibal added further.

Each year, central government will be issuing license to use ‘Aam Aadmi’ term to movie makers, political parties, news channels and other similar establishments depending on worth of their projects.

As per allocation rules, getting a license of using ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ is lower in rural areas as they are not that close to internet and TV. While in urban areas, license cost is much higher.

Sources say that one of the triggers that compelled government to take this decision was a CAG report that said, Congress party suffered from a notional loss of around rupees 5000 crore by letting AAP use the ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ free of cost.

“In Delhi, AAP used it in a monopolistic way. Had it been under government control, it wouldn’t have been possible for a new party like AAP to pay the huge license amount of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’. This drove Congress MLAs out of power and it will result in a loss of around 5k crore to Congress over next next five years,” said an ex-MLA from Delhi.

Government is also looking to channelize ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ in order to generate energy.

“Many times it happens that people are angry with government and they want to yell and abuse us which they do on Twitter and Facebook. So we will be creating ‘Anger Venting Hall’ in each city where people could come and simply yell and that sound energy will be converted into other forms of energy,” revealed a senior government official talking about future prospects of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AamAadmiSentiment.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"Government declares 'Aam Aadmi Sentiment' a natural resource, will regulate its usage",,1387191812.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An ardent fan of Madhu Koda, Nirdaliya dreams to repeat the same what Koda did in Jharkhand by becoming the Chief Minister of state despite being an independent MLA.

Nirdaliya had earlier tried to sell-off himself by uploading his profile on OLX and eBay, but failed to get buyers. He was asking for deputy chief minister’s post in exchange for his support.

Shukla explaining that the hammer will come down thrice before the MLA is declared sold

“These days political parties are very afraid of sting operations, probably that’s why they are not involving themselves directly into any kind of horse trading,” said Nirdaliya, blaming the anti-sentiments wave, “It is then, a friend of mine suggested name of Shri Rajiv Shukla as the only person who could help me to get best deal.”

Sources close to the power corridors say that Shri Shukla was initially reluctant, but later when Nirdaliya begged and reminded him of his actual duties, Rajiv agreed.

“If you are doctor, it’s your duty to help the patient even if he is your enemy. I am a gifted man and have been blessed with talent of negotiations, I can’t let it go waste. Delhi needs me, my country needs me,” declared a spirited Rajiv Shukla.

“Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula, khun nahi woh paani hai, jo is desh ke kaam na aaye, woh bekar jawani hai,” he added.

Reportedly, Rajiv Shukla has already started the process of auction which will take place in a completely legal way.

A close aide of Shukla revealed that it will not be Nirdaliya Sharma who is going to be auctioned, it will be his shoes. Party placing the highest bid on the shoes will become owner of the shoes, and informally, of its owner.

While it appears a perfect plan, experts are not sure if this is going to work.

“Both BJP and AAP are not interested in forming the government, while Congress can’t even if it buys the MLA. I think this is not going to help,” an expert said.

But Rajiv Shukla has factored that in.

“Auction will take place at a 5 star hotel and few companies, mainly shoe brands like Adidas and Nike have agreed to sponsor the event,” he said, “If nothing, we will earn sponsorship revenues as TV is only talking about Delhi elections these days.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajiv_Shukla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/independent-mla-from-delhi-asks-rajiv-shukla-to-help-him-get-auctioned-ipl-style-4258,Independent MLA from Delhi asks Rajiv Shukla to help him get auctioned IPL style,,1386676525.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Vadra, unfairly targeted for becoming rich even though he had all the rights to given his family connections, aims to improve his public image and win public support.

The next politician is born?

The small farmer took this decision after witnessing Congress rout in 4 states in the recently concluded assembly elections. Later he saw his brother-in-law claiming that he was willing to learn from AAP, and that alerted him.

“Did it mean that even Rahul Gandhi was going to organize press conferences and attack Vadra, while giving a clean chit to the rest of the family?” a close aide of Vadra told Faking News why the talented entrepreneur was worried.

To secure his personal future and wealth, Vadra decided that he would too learn from AAP and declared his support for Anna Hazare.

“AAP has declared that their next target would be Haryana, where they are wooing IAS officer Ashok Khemka to join them. Vadra is getting ready for the challenge,” Vadra’s aide explained, “He is learning from Kejriwal and planning to gain from Anna’s goodwill.”

Fed up with BJP’s and AAP’s “pahle aap, pahle aap” attitude where they are offering each other the chance to lay a claim on government formation, Election Commission announced another election between both the parties to decide who will sit in opposition.

Gearing up for ‘Broom 2’

This special “opposition selection election” will take place on 17th of December, in which only BJP and AAP will be contesting.

“It’s a very awkward situation, as both the parties holding the public mandate are willing to be in opposition. Such a love for being in opposition is unheard of in parliamentary democracy,” said the Chief Election Commissioner of India, “That’s why we decided to take public help to end this love lock.”

In this special election, the party getting more seats will be sitting in opposition and the loser will have to go ahead and lay a claim on government formation based on the number of seats they won in the 4th December held assembly polls.

After EC’s statement, party workers of both BJP and AAP have restarted their campaign, but this time with a slightly different agenda in mind.

“We are asking people to vote in our favor to keep us away from power,” said an excited AAP member with a broom tied around his neck.

“Jo jeet ke bhi haaar jaaye use ‘Baazigar Inverse’ kahte hain,” he quipped, which was quickly shared as tweets and Facebook updates by other AAP supporters.

Since the elections would be almost a MTV Roadies like vote-out, AAP has requested hosts Raghu and Rajv to campaign for them again, while BJP has asked Vijay Jolly to put black ink on every Delhi voter’s nameplate so that Delhi residents give them a chance to sit in opposition.

Eyeing a revenge against team Kejriwal, Congress party has offered its full support to AAP.

“We will vote for AAP and force them to form the government with our outside support. Now we know what Rahul Gandhi ji meant when he said we have to learn from AAP,” a Youth Congress member said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DelhiElection.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/election-to-be-held-between-bjp-and-aap-to-decide-who-will-sit-in-opposition-4254,Election to be held between BJP and AAP to decide who will sit in opposition,,1386588189.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-fails-class-test-says-it-was-under-leadership-of-rahul-gandhi-4250,"New Delhi. Pappu, a boy studying in the 6th standard of Rajiv Gandhi Higher Secondary school has credited Rahul Gandhi’s leadership for failing continuously in exams and class tests for one year now.

Pappu has claimed that he had been watching Rahul Gandhi rallies and got so addicted to them that he did not get time to study and prepare for the test.

A very inspiring pose of Rahul Gandhi

Sources say that Pappu’s parents had threatened to send him to a boarding school if he failed again. To escape going to boarding school, Pappu reportedly came up with this idea.

“He knew that his father was a diehard Congress supporter and a fan of Nehru-Gandhi family, and he would never accept any performance as failure if it happened under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” Digvijay Chaudhari, class teacher of Pappu told Faking News.

Following this strategy, Pappu went and told his father this morning that the 14 marks that he got out of 100 in mathematics were obtained under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

As expected, Pappu’s papa hugged his son and told him not to worry as he was still young and had a long career in front of him, just like Rahul Gandhi.

“Furthermore, 14 out of 100 is an improvement from the last test where he got 8,” Pappu’s papa is reported to have told him.

Later, when Pappu’s mummy told both of them to stop fooling around and wake up to the reality, Pappu’s father said, “It is a moment of deep introspection. The education system in India needs an aggressive transformation.”

Pappu too latched on to the opportunity and promised that he would get passing marks in a matter his parents can’t even imagine.

Meanwhile Pappu’s classmate Raju Shukla, who also is the non-playing captain of the school cricket team, came down heavily on Pappu for committing such a blasphemy.

“Even I got 3 marks and failed. But I take complete responsibility for it and thank Rahul Gandhi ji. Had it not for him, I wouldn’t have got even 3 marks,” Raju said.

Pappu has decided to use this sentence when he fails the next test next year.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rahul-gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-fails-class-test-says-it-was-under-leadership-of-rahul-gandhi-4250,"Boy fails class test, says it was under leadership of Rahul Gandhi",,1386583864.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"New Delhi. Eminent Indian physicist Dr. N.C.R Rao has been conferred the Nobel Prize for Physics for his path-breaking research on the properties of “Modi wave”.

In his paper submitted to the Nobel committee, a copy of which is available with Faking News, Dr. Rao has established that Narendra Modi, like light, has dual nature and acts as both a particle and a wave.

Unconfirmed sources have suggested that Dr Rao was selected for the prestigious award by the same panel that had given the Nobel Peace prize to Barack Obama in 2009.

Dr Rao – A physicist, not a political scientist.

“I was intrigued by the Congress spokespersons on TV who said they did not see any Modi wave in-spite of the BJP winning 3 of the 4 Assembly Elections and emerging as the single largest party in the other,” Dr Rao told Faking News, “So, I requested my friend, Yogendra Yadav, for raw data of the elections and began running simulations to explain this strange phenomenon.”

“While several of my initial experiments were inconclusive, I stumbled upon this idea while streaming episodes of The Big Bang Theory on YouTube during my lunch break,” added Dr Rao.

Spurred on by this lucky break, he spent the next few weeks confined to his lab and finally emerged with experimental results and mathematical proof validating his theory.

Dr. Rao addressed the media at this office yesterday and said, “The Congress leaders have lost touch with the present and are stuck in the outdated wave theory. Therefore, they could not detect the Modi particles which were present in abundant quantities all around them.”

Meanwhile in a controversial move, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a PIL in the Supreme court asking for a Bharat Ratna for Mr Rao. Dr. Swamy also alleged that a multi-billion dollar Modi wave detector scam was being covered up at behest of the Gandhi family and has called for a CBI enquiry into this.

Speaking on this issue, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Manish Tewari told Faking News that Mr Rao’s theory needs to be examined holistically to check for the presence of any aberrant techniques of confabulation intended to obfuscate the truth.

While BJP has hailed Dr. Rao’s research, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lashed out at Dr. Rao for ignoring the secularism wave and demanded a special status for it. Dr. Rao has so far declined to comment on this.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Scientist.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"Scientist explains ‘missing’ Modi wave, gets Nobel prize",,1386578053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The meeting took at Sonia Gandhi’s residence. This Faking News reporter could record the proceedings using a camera hidden in Kapil Sibal’s eyebrows. Following is the highlights of the discussion:

Rajiv Shukla (almost shouting): On your feet, Noor-e-Hindustan, Brand-Ambassador-e-Dimple Shri Rahul Gandhi ji is coming. There is no Modi wave, Rahul Gandhi ji got a shave!

Rahul Gandhi asking Sonia Gandhi if he should rename Congress as Aam Aadmi’s Big Party

(Rahul Gandhi enters with Sonia Gandhi)

Rahul Gandhi: Thanks Shukla ji. We need to learn from AAP, and I can see that you have learnt poetry from Kumar Vishvas. I’m impressed. Sibal ji, you should also learn poetry from him.

Kapil Sibal: I already have a poem for you Rahul baba – “Maybe no one turns up in rallies but your speeches are cute, maybe Congress has crashed in elections but you are parachute!”

(everyone claps)

Rahul Gandhi: Good show! We need to learn more from AAP. But first let’s find out why we lost the elections. Clearly, I’m not responsible, right?

Rajiv Shukla: Yes, Rahul ji, you are not responsible. If you want, I can take full responsibility and give a public statement.

Sonia Gandhi: No Shuks, nobody will give any importance to your comment. And anyway, we are here for analysis of defeat, not to check loyalty. Let’s first talk about Rajasthan. Ashok Gehlot has shocked me by claiming central policies were responsible. He has refused to take blame, and Rahul is not responsible. Now someone from center has to take blame.

Kapil Sibal: Madam, I think our tough stand on IT laws backfired. Gehlot ji had a lot of non-resident Rajasthani supporters in Turkey, which was quite visible on his Facebook page. But I have heard that they were quite upset about our stand on cyber regulation and they didn’t show up during voting.

Sonia Gandhi: So you take responsibility for Rajasthan?

Kapil Sibal: Yes ma’am. “I am responsible. Gehlot is gullible. Results horrible. Twinkle twinkle.”

Rahul Gandhi: wow… good poem!

Sonia Gandhi: Ok, what about Madhya Pradesh? Digvijay ji, you disappointed us.

Digvijay Singh: Madam ji, this time I bet, RSS is behind it.

Rahul Gandhi: But uncle, RSS is not part of Congress, we need someone from the party to accept the responsibility.

Digvijay Singh: This Jyotiraditya Scindia should take responsibility.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Abey chup!

Sonia Gandhi: Please, maintain decorum. We have to respect people, except Narendra Modi.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Sorry, but I’m not going to take responsibility. Kamal Nath ji or Digvijay Singh ji should take blame.

Digvijay Singh: I can’t take blame. I only blame RSS.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: (mumbles something again)

Digvijay Singh: Let’s blame Electronic Voting Machines.

Sonia Gandhi: I think this is not going anywhere.

Kapil Sibal: I can take blame for this too if these guys are not willing to. It will mean zero loss to me.

Sonia Gandhi: Great. Zero loss to our rescue again. Now Chhatisgarh.

Ajit Jogi: Madam, can we blame it on our leaders who died in Naxal attack? We anyway blame leaders after they die, like Narsimha Rao ji.

Sonia Gandhi: Jogi ji, are you drunk?

Ajit Jogi: Sorry madam, I take responsibility.

Sonia Gandhi: That was quick. Now let’s move to Delhi. What happened Sheila ji?

Sheila Dixit: Rahul ji has already said it was AAP factor and he will learn from AAP.

Sonia Gandhi: Yes, but we need someone to take the blame. Are you taking the responsibility?

Sheila Dixit: I don’t know. I always maintained that I was not responsible for Delhi’s law and order as it was under center’s control, or not responsible for roads as MCD was under BJP control, or responsible for corruption in CWG. Now how do I take responsibility for this?

Sonia Gandhi: But someone have to.

Digvijay Singh: I don’t know why are we not blaming Narendra Modi!

Sonia Gandhi: What has happened to you Digvijay ji? If we blame Narendra Modi, it means we are accepting there is a Modi wave!

Rahul Gandhi: But that’s alright mamma. We live in Delhi, which is far far away from seashore and we shouldn’t fear any wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Diggi! Look what you have done to Rahul baba’s thinking!

(Digvijay Singh is taken aback and keeps silent)

Sonia Gandhi: Silence will not work! Not a time to be silent. You have to take the blame.

Manmohan Singh: Theek hai. (on cue at the mention of “silence”)

Soon after giving a controversial statement about how he was afraid of talking to women, Union Minister Farooq Abdullah gave another shocker by revealing that he was afraid to talk about Article 370 of the Indian constitution even more.

Abdullah said that he and his men were scared to talk about the undebatable article as they fear that they may end up in opposition, which is worse than going to jail.

The scared Abdullah

“Look at Tarun Tejpal, he might be in jail, but he’s getting all the support. Now contrast it when he was in opposition i.e. when NDA was in power; he was almost bankrupt!” a close aide of senior Abdullah explained.

Aides say that this was the reason (scared of being in opposition) National Conference didn’t walk out of NDA even after 2002 Gujarat riots, though later they blamed it all on Narendra Modi after losing the elections.

“Now Modi is haunting them again by raking Article 370,” the aide added.

While senior Abdullah didn’t comment on above explanations and speculations, he conceded that he was in no mood to discuss women and Article 370.

“It is not like I am blaming Article 370, I am blaming society itself. The way this article impacts local elections is the main cause of fear,” he said.

“This Artcile 370 is even more complicated than a woman,” senior Abdullah further added, which immediately caused outrage on Twitter and TV channels.

While Farooq Abdullah might be drawing flak for his comments, many in Jammu & Kashmir agree with him.

“I am 48 years old and till now have never ever debated about 370 article,” said a local leader Balwan Khan, explaining how afraid he is to even touch the topic.

“It is about local culture. People in Delhi should respect our opinions and not thrust their ideas of right and wrong on us,” another local leader supported Farooq Abdullah.

However his son and J&K CM Omar Abdullah has regretted his father’s comment and called it a “misplaced attempt at speaking truth”.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Farooq_Abdullah.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scared-to-talk-about-article-370-more-than-scared-to-talk-to-women-farooq-abdullah-4226,Scared of talking about Article 370 more than talking to women: Farooq Abdullah,,1386325814.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kartik, a resident of Karol Bagh was detained for questioning by police after a failed attempt to vote twice. Officials say that after casting his original vote, Kartik was trying to cast vote even for his fake Facebook profile.

“It is not a traditional case of proxy voting or booth capturing, it’s a case which has much to do with how the virtual lives of people are impacting their real lives,” said Delhi police commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi.

One of the pictures liked by Kartik from both his Facebook profiles

“Kartik was living a dual cyber life – one of his own, and other of the fake account he created with the same name. He was so obsessed with his fake Kartik profile that he started believing as if he were two persons instead of one. In short, he was suffering from split personality disorder,” the commissioner explained.

Sources (fake profiles of girls added to both the accounts of Kartik) say that Kartik was a devoted AAP activist on his original profile, while on his fake profile he was a staunch BJP supporter and a diehard Narendra Modi fan.

“It’s not surprising. Many surveys have revealed that there are people in Delhi who are supporting BJP at center but AAP in the local assembly election, but we never knew this dual support could lead to dual personality,” said Jay Prakash Narain, a political expert.

Police sources say that after voting for AAP in the morning, Kartik returned to his home and logged into Facebook to put pictures of his blue inked finger. Later, out of habit, he also logged into his fake profile, and that’s when he felt an insuppressible urge to vote for BJP too.

“He came back home, went to his bedroom, and after half an hour, he said he was going to finish a pending work,” revealed Kartik’s mother. About an hour later, she got the news of her son being detained by the police.

As Ravi Shastri would say, “all three four results are possible” in Delhi assembly elections. It could go AAP, BJP, or Congress way, or there could be hung assembly.

Faking News has found from its sources, what will these parties say when election results are announced. They have already weighed in various results:

Scenario 1: AAP wins clear majority

AAP: We told you! Our internal survey says we will form next government at center too. BJP: This clearly shows that people with huge support on Twitter and Facebook are winning. Narendra Modi will be the next Prime Minister. Congress: This clearly shows that people supported by the youth are winning. Congress will form the next government under leadership of Youth Icon Rahul Gandhi.

Scenario 2: BJP wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: WE RULE THE WORLD! Congress: AAP was planted by BJP to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji, we will defeat them in general elections.

Scenario 3: Congress wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: AAP was planted by Congress to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that due to the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji and Narendra Modi ji, we will defeat them in general elections. Congress: WE RULE THE WORLD!

In a new case of ‘Bribe for Vote’ incident, a new sting operation carried out by a party that specializes in exposés has revealed that political parties were targeting online gaming addicts and giving free high speed broadband internet connection to them.

Experts believe that given the ever increasing population of gaming addicts by the day, many secular parties are rethinking their strategies and thinking of them as their new vote bank.

Manifesto appealing to a gamer

Sources tell that the political parties decided to take this route after ‘liquor for vote’ became too predictable and media started reporting about it.

“There was also the risk of people not turning up due to hangover,” a leader confirmed why his party decided to offer 10 Mbps broadband instead of bottles of rum.

“We thought we will target alcoholics and exploit their weakness, but yesterday when I saw my own son (a counter strike addict) become violent and later unconscious when his broadband had a downtime of 4 seconds, I realized that gamers in the age group of 18-27 can be lured more easily than anyone else. Liquor addiction is nothing when compared to gaming addiction,” added the leader, whose son converted everyone in his “clan” as voters for his dad’s party.

According to sources, there are around 15 lakh odd gamers in Delhi and political parties believe that this group can impact the results in the triangular fight between Congress, BJP, and AAP.

This whole new revelation has left Yogendra Yadav of AAP totally shattered.

“We did millions of internal surveys but failed to do one that tells us the population of gamers in Delhi. Had we known they are so large in numbers, we would have had something for them as well in our manifesto,” said Yadav.

In order to make amends, AAP has now assured cheat code free gaming experience to honest gamers if voted to power. They have further promised to pass GameLokpal biill within 15 days which will punish cheaters.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gaming.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-parties-give-high-speed-internet-to-gaming-addicts-in-return-for-vote-4204,Political parties give high speed internet to gaming addicts in return for vote,,1386148336.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fearing that all the exposes and protests that they excel at and are so used to doing would soon become a thing of past, AAP has decided to include their continuity as the last and final condition in front of Congress before they agree to form a government in the city.

Both Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwaas signalling number of demands they would make after this.

“It is our forte and something for which people of Delhi have reposed their faith in us. Therefore we cannot stop doing it,” Arvind Kejriwal confirmed at a media gathering.

“We are still unsure whether to expose our own Govt or the opposition after coming to power. To solve that confusion, Yogendra Yadav ji is already conducting internal surveys,” Kejriwal further added.

Sources say as soon as Delhi elections results came out in open, there was joy as well as a tinge of sadness in the AAP camp. They became nostalgic and started crying like a student whose last day in a carefree college life has ended and is now staring at a life full of responsibility and accountability.

“It was all fun while it lasted. Those shocking revelations, all round allegations, complaints with the system; those were the best days of our life, back in the summer of three plus nine (2012),” said Kumar Vishwaas in his inimitable style albeit in English.

The news from Congress camp is that it has agreed to the demand in unequivocal terms. “We are so used to the exposes and protests done by AAP now that some of our leaders had already started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms ever since our government was defeated in capital. We look forward to getting exposed again by AAP under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi ji,” Ahmed Patel told Faking News.

However this latest acceptance of their demand has created panic in AAP camp and they have hired IIM pass outs to help them put up a demand that Congress will never agree upon.

Meanwhile experts feel that even if AAP somehow exposes itself, Arvind Kejriwal will call it a failure and exposure of Aam Aadmi and not his own.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kejriwal_window_reuters_360x270.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-demands-they-be-allowed-to-continue-to-expose-and-protest-even-after-forming-a-government-4297,AAP demands they be allowed to continue to expose and protest even after forming a government,,1387269881.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"New Delhi. In a major decision which is going to change the way people look at natural resources, Government of India has declared ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ a natural resource and has created rules to regulate its usage like any other natural resources.

Government’s initiative is inspired from a report published by a leading investment bank which points out recent events where ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ yielded huge profits for people involved.

AAP – One of the top gainers.

Be it Chennai Express’ box office performance or AAP’s grand debut in Delhi elections, both have a ‘Aam Aadmi’ connection. While the former capitalized on famous dialogue ‘Dont Underestimate The Power Of A Common Man’, the latter’s whole agenda was around Aam Aadmi and even Salman’s coming movie ‘Jai Ho’ is using a ‘Aam Aadmi’ centric dialogue in its trailer, says the report explaining business potential of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.

“It’s a good opportunity for government to generate some extra revenue. We have already witnessed its power and can’t distribute it for free. And above all it’s a renewable source,” told Kapil Sibal while talking to media at a press conference.

“From now on, people using the term ‘Aam Aadmi’ for their personal benefit must pay accordingly,” Sibal added further.

Each year, central government will be issuing license to use ‘Aam Aadmi’ term to movie makers, political parties, news channels and other similar establishments depending on worth of their projects.

As per allocation rules, getting a license of using ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ is lower in rural areas as they are not that close to internet and TV. While in urban areas, license cost is much higher.

Sources say that one of the triggers that compelled government to take this decision was a CAG report that said, Congress party suffered from a notional loss of around rupees 5000 crore by letting AAP use the ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ free of cost.

“In Delhi, AAP used it in a monopolistic way. Had it been under government control, it wouldn’t have been possible for a new party like AAP to pay the huge license amount of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’. This drove Congress MLAs out of power and it will result in a loss of around 5k crore to Congress over next next five years,” said an ex-MLA from Delhi.

Government is also looking to channelize ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ in order to generate energy.

“Many times it happens that people are angry with government and they want to yell and abuse us which they do on Twitter and Facebook. So we will be creating ‘Anger Venting Hall’ in each city where people could come and simply yell and that sound energy will be converted into other forms of energy,” revealed a senior government official talking about future prospects of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AamAadmiSentiment.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"Government declares 'Aam Aadmi Sentiment' a natural resource, will regulate its usage",,1387191812.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An ardent fan of Madhu Koda, Nirdaliya dreams to repeat the same what Koda did in Jharkhand by becoming the Chief Minister of state despite being an independent MLA.

Nirdaliya had earlier tried to sell-off himself by uploading his profile on OLX and eBay, but failed to get buyers. He was asking for deputy chief minister’s post in exchange for his support.

Shukla explaining that the hammer will come down thrice before the MLA is declared sold

“These days political parties are very afraid of sting operations, probably that’s why they are not involving themselves directly into any kind of horse trading,” said Nirdaliya, blaming the anti-sentiments wave, “It is then, a friend of mine suggested name of Shri Rajiv Shukla as the only person who could help me to get best deal.”

Sources close to the power corridors say that Shri Shukla was initially reluctant, but later when Nirdaliya begged and reminded him of his actual duties, Rajiv agreed.

“If you are doctor, it’s your duty to help the patient even if he is your enemy. I am a gifted man and have been blessed with talent of negotiations, I can’t let it go waste. Delhi needs me, my country needs me,” declared a spirited Rajiv Shukla.

“Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula, khun nahi woh paani hai, jo is desh ke kaam na aaye, woh bekar jawani hai,” he added.

Reportedly, Rajiv Shukla has already started the process of auction which will take place in a completely legal way.

A close aide of Shukla revealed that it will not be Nirdaliya Sharma who is going to be auctioned, it will be his shoes. Party placing the highest bid on the shoes will become owner of the shoes, and informally, of its owner.

While it appears a perfect plan, experts are not sure if this is going to work.

“Both BJP and AAP are not interested in forming the government, while Congress can’t even if it buys the MLA. I think this is not going to help,” an expert said.

But Rajiv Shukla has factored that in.

“Auction will take place at a 5 star hotel and few companies, mainly shoe brands like Adidas and Nike have agreed to sponsor the event,” he said, “If nothing, we will earn sponsorship revenues as TV is only talking about Delhi elections these days.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajiv_Shukla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/independent-mla-from-delhi-asks-rajiv-shukla-to-help-him-get-auctioned-ipl-style-4258,Independent MLA from Delhi asks Rajiv Shukla to help him get auctioned IPL style,,1386676525.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Vadra, unfairly targeted for becoming rich even though he had all the rights to given his family connections, aims to improve his public image and win public support.

The next politician is born?

The small farmer took this decision after witnessing Congress rout in 4 states in the recently concluded assembly elections. Later he saw his brother-in-law claiming that he was willing to learn from AAP, and that alerted him.

“Did it mean that even Rahul Gandhi was going to organize press conferences and attack Vadra, while giving a clean chit to the rest of the family?” a close aide of Vadra told Faking News why the talented entrepreneur was worried.

To secure his personal future and wealth, Vadra decided that he would too learn from AAP and declared his support for Anna Hazare.

“AAP has declared that their next target would be Haryana, where they are wooing IAS officer Ashok Khemka to join them. Vadra is getting ready for the challenge,” Vadra’s aide explained, “He is learning from Kejriwal and planning to gain from Anna’s goodwill.”

As part of this strategy, Robert Vadra will soon fly to Ralegan Siddhi to join Anna. He has even offered to build a grand DLF Mall in Ralegan Siddhi if the clauses of Jan Lokpal Bill are modified to exclude him, just like he’s excluded from security checks at airports.

“I think he will announce formation of Khas Aadmi Party at the end of this fast by Anna and fight elections in Haryana against Aam Aadmi Party. While AAP can get some urban votes, rural votes will surely go to Vadra because his party will be called KHAP,” a political expert claimed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robert_Vadra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-to-join-annas-latest-fast-to-improve-his-image-4256,Robert Vadra to join Anna’s latest fast to improve his image,,1386671209.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fed up with BJP’s and AAP’s “pahle aap, pahle aap” attitude where they are offering each other the chance to lay a claim on government formation, Election Commission announced another election between both the parties to decide who will sit in opposition.

Gearing up for ‘Broom 2’

This special “opposition selection election” will take place on 17th of December, in which only BJP and AAP will be contesting.

“It’s a very awkward situation, as both the parties holding the public mandate are willing to be in opposition. Such a love for being in opposition is unheard of in parliamentary democracy,” said the Chief Election Commissioner of India, “That’s why we decided to take public help to end this love lock.”

In this special election, the party getting more seats will be sitting in opposition and the loser will have to go ahead and lay a claim on government formation based on the number of seats they won in the 4th December held assembly polls.

After EC’s statement, party workers of both BJP and AAP have restarted their campaign, but this time with a slightly different agenda in mind.

“We are asking people to vote in our favor to keep us away from power,” said an excited AAP member with a broom tied around his neck.

“Jo jeet ke bhi haaar jaaye use ‘Baazigar Inverse’ kahte hain,” he quipped, which was quickly shared as tweets and Facebook updates by other AAP supporters.

Since the elections would be almost a MTV Roadies like vote-out, AAP has requested hosts Raghu and Rajv to campaign for them again, while BJP has asked Vijay Jolly to put black ink on every Delhi voter’s nameplate so that Delhi residents give them a chance to sit in opposition.

Eyeing a revenge against team Kejriwal, Congress party has offered its full support to AAP.

“We will vote for AAP and force them to form the government with our outside support. Now we know what Rahul Gandhi ji meant when he said we have to learn from AAP,” a Youth Congress member said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DelhiElection.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/election-to-be-held-between-bjp-and-aap-to-decide-who-will-sit-in-opposition-4254,Election to be held between BJP and AAP to decide who will sit in opposition,,1386588189.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-fails-class-test-says-it-was-under-leadership-of-rahul-gandhi-4250,"New Delhi. Pappu, a boy studying in the 6th standard of Rajiv Gandhi Higher Secondary school has credited Rahul Gandhi’s leadership for failing continuously in exams and class tests for one year now.

Pappu has claimed that he had been watching Rahul Gandhi rallies and got so addicted to them that he did not get time to study and prepare for the test.

A very inspiring pose of Rahul Gandhi

Sources say that Pappu’s parents had threatened to send him to a boarding school if he failed again. To escape going to boarding school, Pappu reportedly came up with this idea.

“He knew that his father was a diehard Congress supporter and a fan of Nehru-Gandhi family, and he would never accept any performance as failure if it happened under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” Digvijay Chaudhari, class teacher of Pappu told Faking News.

Following this strategy, Pappu went and told his father this morning that the 14 marks that he got out of 100 in mathematics were obtained under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

As expected, Pappu’s papa hugged his son and told him not to worry as he was still young and had a long career in front of him, just like Rahul Gandhi.

“Furthermore, 14 out of 100 is an improvement from the last test where he got 8,” Pappu’s papa is reported to have told him.

Later, when Pappu’s mummy told both of them to stop fooling around and wake up to the reality, Pappu’s father said, “It is a moment of deep introspection. The education system in India needs an aggressive transformation.”

Pappu too latched on to the opportunity and promised that he would get passing marks in a matter his parents can’t even imagine.

Meanwhile Pappu’s classmate Raju Shukla, who also is the non-playing captain of the school cricket team, came down heavily on Pappu for committing such a blasphemy.

“Even I got 3 marks and failed. But I take complete responsibility for it and thank Rahul Gandhi ji. Had it not for him, I wouldn’t have got even 3 marks,” Raju said.

Pappu has decided to use this sentence when he fails the next test next year.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rahul-gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-fails-class-test-says-it-was-under-leadership-of-rahul-gandhi-4250,"Boy fails class test, says it was under leadership of Rahul Gandhi",,1386583864.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"New Delhi. Eminent Indian physicist Dr. N.C.R Rao has been conferred the Nobel Prize for Physics for his path-breaking research on the properties of “Modi wave”.

In his paper submitted to the Nobel committee, a copy of which is available with Faking News, Dr. Rao has established that Narendra Modi, like light, has dual nature and acts as both a particle and a wave.

Unconfirmed sources have suggested that Dr Rao was selected for the prestigious award by the same panel that had given the Nobel Peace prize to Barack Obama in 2009.

Dr Rao – A physicist, not a political scientist.

“I was intrigued by the Congress spokespersons on TV who said they did not see any Modi wave in-spite of the BJP winning 3 of the 4 Assembly Elections and emerging as the single largest party in the other,” Dr Rao told Faking News, “So, I requested my friend, Yogendra Yadav, for raw data of the elections and began running simulations to explain this strange phenomenon.”

“While several of my initial experiments were inconclusive, I stumbled upon this idea while streaming episodes of The Big Bang Theory on YouTube during my lunch break,” added Dr Rao.

Spurred on by this lucky break, he spent the next few weeks confined to his lab and finally emerged with experimental results and mathematical proof validating his theory.

Dr. Rao addressed the media at this office yesterday and said, “The Congress leaders have lost touch with the present and are stuck in the outdated wave theory. Therefore, they could not detect the Modi particles which were present in abundant quantities all around them.”

Meanwhile in a controversial move, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a PIL in the Supreme court asking for a Bharat Ratna for Mr Rao. Dr. Swamy also alleged that a multi-billion dollar Modi wave detector scam was being covered up at behest of the Gandhi family and has called for a CBI enquiry into this.

Speaking on this issue, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Manish Tewari told Faking News that Mr Rao’s theory needs to be examined holistically to check for the presence of any aberrant techniques of confabulation intended to obfuscate the truth.

While BJP has hailed Dr. Rao’s research, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lashed out at Dr. Rao for ignoring the secularism wave and demanded a special status for it. Dr. Rao has so far declined to comment on this.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Scientist.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"Scientist explains ‘missing’ Modi wave, gets Nobel prize",,1386578053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The meeting took at Sonia Gandhi’s residence. This Faking News reporter could record the proceedings using a camera hidden in Kapil Sibal’s eyebrows. Following is the highlights of the discussion:

Rajiv Shukla (almost shouting): On your feet, Noor-e-Hindustan, Brand-Ambassador-e-Dimple Shri Rahul Gandhi ji is coming. There is no Modi wave, Rahul Gandhi ji got a shave!

Rahul Gandhi asking Sonia Gandhi if he should rename Congress as Aam Aadmi’s Big Party

(Rahul Gandhi enters with Sonia Gandhi)

Rahul Gandhi: Thanks Shukla ji. We need to learn from AAP, and I can see that you have learnt poetry from Kumar Vishvas. I’m impressed. Sibal ji, you should also learn poetry from him.

Kapil Sibal: I already have a poem for you Rahul baba – “Maybe no one turns up in rallies but your speeches are cute, maybe Congress has crashed in elections but you are parachute!”

(everyone claps)

Rahul Gandhi: Good show! We need to learn more from AAP. But first let’s find out why we lost the elections. Clearly, I’m not responsible, right?

Rajiv Shukla: Yes, Rahul ji, you are not responsible. If you want, I can take full responsibility and give a public statement.

Sonia Gandhi: No Shuks, nobody will give any importance to your comment. And anyway, we are here for analysis of defeat, not to check loyalty. Let’s first talk about Rajasthan. Ashok Gehlot has shocked me by claiming central policies were responsible. He has refused to take blame, and Rahul is not responsible. Now someone from center has to take blame.

Kapil Sibal: Madam, I think our tough stand on IT laws backfired. Gehlot ji had a lot of non-resident Rajasthani supporters in Turkey, which was quite visible on his Facebook page. But I have heard that they were quite upset about our stand on cyber regulation and they didn’t show up during voting.

Sonia Gandhi: So you take responsibility for Rajasthan?

Kapil Sibal: Yes ma’am. “I am responsible. Gehlot is gullible. Results horrible. Twinkle twinkle.”

Rahul Gandhi: wow… good poem!

Sonia Gandhi: Ok, what about Madhya Pradesh? Digvijay ji, you disappointed us.

Digvijay Singh: Madam ji, this time I bet, RSS is behind it.

Rahul Gandhi: But uncle, RSS is not part of Congress, we need someone from the party to accept the responsibility.

Digvijay Singh: This Jyotiraditya Scindia should take responsibility.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Abey chup!

Sonia Gandhi: Please, maintain decorum. We have to respect people, except Narendra Modi.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Sorry, but I’m not going to take responsibility. Kamal Nath ji or Digvijay Singh ji should take blame.

Digvijay Singh: I can’t take blame. I only blame RSS.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: (mumbles something again)

Digvijay Singh: Let’s blame Electronic Voting Machines.

Sonia Gandhi: I think this is not going anywhere.

Kapil Sibal: I can take blame for this too if these guys are not willing to. It will mean zero loss to me.

Sonia Gandhi: Great. Zero loss to our rescue again. Now Chhatisgarh.

Ajit Jogi: Madam, can we blame it on our leaders who died in Naxal attack? We anyway blame leaders after they die, like Narsimha Rao ji.

Sonia Gandhi: Jogi ji, are you drunk?

Ajit Jogi: Sorry madam, I take responsibility.

Sonia Gandhi: That was quick. Now let’s move to Delhi. What happened Sheila ji?

Sheila Dixit: Rahul ji has already said it was AAP factor and he will learn from AAP.

Sonia Gandhi: Yes, but we need someone to take the blame. Are you taking the responsibility?

Sheila Dixit: I don’t know. I always maintained that I was not responsible for Delhi’s law and order as it was under center’s control, or not responsible for roads as MCD was under BJP control, or responsible for corruption in CWG. Now how do I take responsibility for this?

Sonia Gandhi: But someone have to.

Digvijay Singh: I don’t know why are we not blaming Narendra Modi!

Sonia Gandhi: What has happened to you Digvijay ji? If we blame Narendra Modi, it means we are accepting there is a Modi wave!

Rahul Gandhi: But that’s alright mamma. We live in Delhi, which is far far away from seashore and we shouldn’t fear any wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Diggi! Look what you have done to Rahul baba’s thinking!

(Digvijay Singh is taken aback and keeps silent)

Sonia Gandhi: Silence will not work! Not a time to be silent. You have to take the blame.

Manmohan Singh: Theek hai. (on cue at the mention of “silence”)

Soon after giving a controversial statement about how he was afraid of talking to women, Union Minister Farooq Abdullah gave another shocker by revealing that he was afraid to talk about Article 370 of the Indian constitution even more.

Abdullah said that he and his men were scared to talk about the undebatable article as they fear that they may end up in opposition, which is worse than going to jail.

The scared Abdullah

“Look at Tarun Tejpal, he might be in jail, but he’s getting all the support. Now contrast it when he was in opposition i.e. when NDA was in power; he was almost bankrupt!” a close aide of senior Abdullah explained.

Aides say that this was the reason (scared of being in opposition) National Conference didn’t walk out of NDA even after 2002 Gujarat riots, though later they blamed it all on Narendra Modi after losing the elections.

“Now Modi is haunting them again by raking Article 370,” the aide added.

While senior Abdullah didn’t comment on above explanations and speculations, he conceded that he was in no mood to discuss women and Article 370.

“It is not like I am blaming Article 370, I am blaming society itself. The way this article impacts local elections is the main cause of fear,” he said.

“This Artcile 370 is even more complicated than a woman,” senior Abdullah further added, which immediately caused outrage on Twitter and TV channels.

While Farooq Abdullah might be drawing flak for his comments, many in Jammu & Kashmir agree with him.

“I am 48 years old and till now have never ever debated about 370 article,” said a local leader Balwan Khan, explaining how afraid he is to even touch the topic.

“It is about local culture. People in Delhi should respect our opinions and not thrust their ideas of right and wrong on us,” another local leader supported Farooq Abdullah.

However his son and J&K CM Omar Abdullah has regretted his father’s comment and called it a “misplaced attempt at speaking truth”.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Farooq_Abdullah.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scared-to-talk-about-article-370-more-than-scared-to-talk-to-women-farooq-abdullah-4226,Scared of talking about Article 370 more than talking to women: Farooq Abdullah,,1386325814.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kartik, a resident of Karol Bagh was detained for questioning by police after a failed attempt to vote twice. Officials say that after casting his original vote, Kartik was trying to cast vote even for his fake Facebook profile.

“It is not a traditional case of proxy voting or booth capturing, it’s a case which has much to do with how the virtual lives of people are impacting their real lives,” said Delhi police commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi.

One of the pictures liked by Kartik from both his Facebook profiles

“Kartik was living a dual cyber life – one of his own, and other of the fake account he created with the same name. He was so obsessed with his fake Kartik profile that he started believing as if he were two persons instead of one. In short, he was suffering from split personality disorder,” the commissioner explained.

Sources (fake profiles of girls added to both the accounts of Kartik) say that Kartik was a devoted AAP activist on his original profile, while on his fake profile he was a staunch BJP supporter and a diehard Narendra Modi fan.

“It’s not surprising. Many surveys have revealed that there are people in Delhi who are supporting BJP at center but AAP in the local assembly election, but we never knew this dual support could lead to dual personality,” said Jay Prakash Narain, a political expert.

Police sources say that after voting for AAP in the morning, Kartik returned to his home and logged into Facebook to put pictures of his blue inked finger. Later, out of habit, he also logged into his fake profile, and that’s when he felt an insuppressible urge to vote for BJP too.

“He came back home, went to his bedroom, and after half an hour, he said he was going to finish a pending work,” revealed Kartik’s mother. About an hour later, she got the news of her son being detained by the police.

As Ravi Shastri would say, “all three four results are possible” in Delhi assembly elections. It could go AAP, BJP, or Congress way, or there could be hung assembly.

Faking News has found from its sources, what will these parties say when election results are announced. They have already weighed in various results:

Scenario 1: AAP wins clear majority

AAP: We told you! Our internal survey says we will form next government at center too. BJP: This clearly shows that people with huge support on Twitter and Facebook are winning. Narendra Modi will be the next Prime Minister. Congress: This clearly shows that people supported by the youth are winning. Congress will form the next government under leadership of Youth Icon Rahul Gandhi.

Scenario 2: BJP wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: WE RULE THE WORLD! Congress: AAP was planted by BJP to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji, we will defeat them in general elections.

Scenario 3: Congress wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: AAP was planted by Congress to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that due to the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji and Narendra Modi ji, we will defeat them in general elections. Congress: WE RULE THE WORLD!

In a new case of ‘Bribe for Vote’ incident, a new sting operation carried out by a party that specializes in exposés has revealed that political parties were targeting online gaming addicts and giving free high speed broadband internet connection to them.

Experts believe that given the ever increasing population of gaming addicts by the day, many secular parties are rethinking their strategies and thinking of them as their new vote bank.

Manifesto appealing to a gamer

Sources tell that the political parties decided to take this route after ‘liquor for vote’ became too predictable and media started reporting about it.

“There was also the risk of people not turning up due to hangover,” a leader confirmed why his party decided to offer 10 Mbps broadband instead of bottles of rum.

“We thought we will target alcoholics and exploit their weakness, but yesterday when I saw my own son (a counter strike addict) become violent and later unconscious when his broadband had a downtime of 4 seconds, I realized that gamers in the age group of 18-27 can be lured more easily than anyone else. Liquor addiction is nothing when compared to gaming addiction,” added the leader, whose son converted everyone in his “clan” as voters for his dad’s party.

According to sources, there are around 15 lakh odd gamers in Delhi and political parties believe that this group can impact the results in the triangular fight between Congress, BJP, and AAP.

This whole new revelation has left Yogendra Yadav of AAP totally shattered.

“We did millions of internal surveys but failed to do one that tells us the population of gamers in Delhi. Had we known they are so large in numbers, we would have had something for them as well in our manifesto,” said Yadav.

In order to make amends, AAP has now assured cheat code free gaming experience to honest gamers if voted to power. They have further promised to pass GameLokpal biill within 15 days which will punish cheaters.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gaming.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-parties-give-high-speed-internet-to-gaming-addicts-in-return-for-vote-4204,Political parties give high speed internet to gaming addicts in return for vote,,1386148336.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fearing that all the exposes and protests that they excel at and are so used to doing would soon become a thing of past, AAP has decided to include their continuity as the last and final condition in front of Congress before they agree to form a government in the city.

Both Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwaas signalling number of demands they would make after this.

“It is our forte and something for which people of Delhi have reposed their faith in us. Therefore we cannot stop doing it,” Arvind Kejriwal confirmed at a media gathering.

“We are still unsure whether to expose our own Govt or the opposition after coming to power. To solve that confusion, Yogendra Yadav ji is already conducting internal surveys,” Kejriwal further added.

Sources say as soon as Delhi elections results came out in open, there was joy as well as a tinge of sadness in the AAP camp. They became nostalgic and started crying like a student whose last day in a carefree college life has ended and is now staring at a life full of responsibility and accountability.

“It was all fun while it lasted. Those shocking revelations, all round allegations, complaints with the system; those were the best days of our life, back in the summer of three plus nine (2012),” said Kumar Vishwaas in his inimitable style albeit in English.

The news from Congress camp is that it has agreed to the demand in unequivocal terms. “We are so used to the exposes and protests done by AAP now that some of our leaders had already started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms ever since our government was defeated in capital. We look forward to getting exposed again by AAP under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi ji,” Ahmed Patel told Faking News.

However this latest acceptance of their demand has created panic in AAP camp and they have hired IIM pass outs to help them put up a demand that Congress will never agree upon.

Meanwhile experts feel that even if AAP somehow exposes itself, Arvind Kejriwal will call it a failure and exposure of Aam Aadmi and not his own.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kejriwal_window_reuters_360x270.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-demands-they-be-allowed-to-continue-to-expose-and-protest-even-after-forming-a-government-4297,AAP demands they be allowed to continue to expose and protest even after forming a government,,1387269881.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"New Delhi. In a major decision which is going to change the way people look at natural resources, Government of India has declared ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ a natural resource and has created rules to regulate its usage like any other natural resources.

Government’s initiative is inspired from a report published by a leading investment bank which points out recent events where ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ yielded huge profits for people involved.

AAP – One of the top gainers.

Be it Chennai Express’ box office performance or AAP’s grand debut in Delhi elections, both have a ‘Aam Aadmi’ connection. While the former capitalized on famous dialogue ‘Dont Underestimate The Power Of A Common Man’, the latter’s whole agenda was around Aam Aadmi and even Salman’s coming movie ‘Jai Ho’ is using a ‘Aam Aadmi’ centric dialogue in its trailer, says the report explaining business potential of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.

“It’s a good opportunity for government to generate some extra revenue. We have already witnessed its power and can’t distribute it for free. And above all it’s a renewable source,” told Kapil Sibal while talking to media at a press conference.

“From now on, people using the term ‘Aam Aadmi’ for their personal benefit must pay accordingly,” Sibal added further.

Each year, central government will be issuing license to use ‘Aam Aadmi’ term to movie makers, political parties, news channels and other similar establishments depending on worth of their projects.

As per allocation rules, getting a license of using ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ is lower in rural areas as they are not that close to internet and TV. While in urban areas, license cost is much higher.

Sources say that one of the triggers that compelled government to take this decision was a CAG report that said, Congress party suffered from a notional loss of around rupees 5000 crore by letting AAP use the ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ free of cost.

“In Delhi, AAP used it in a monopolistic way. Had it been under government control, it wouldn’t have been possible for a new party like AAP to pay the huge license amount of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’. This drove Congress MLAs out of power and it will result in a loss of around 5k crore to Congress over next next five years,” said an ex-MLA from Delhi.

Government is also looking to channelize ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ in order to generate energy.

“Many times it happens that people are angry with government and they want to yell and abuse us which they do on Twitter and Facebook. So we will be creating ‘Anger Venting Hall’ in each city where people could come and simply yell and that sound energy will be converted into other forms of energy,” revealed a senior government official talking about future prospects of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AamAadmiSentiment.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"Government declares 'Aam Aadmi Sentiment' a natural resource, will regulate its usage",,1387191812.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An ardent fan of Madhu Koda, Nirdaliya dreams to repeat the same what Koda did in Jharkhand by becoming the Chief Minister of state despite being an independent MLA.

Nirdaliya had earlier tried to sell-off himself by uploading his profile on OLX and eBay, but failed to get buyers. He was asking for deputy chief minister’s post in exchange for his support.

Shukla explaining that the hammer will come down thrice before the MLA is declared sold

“These days political parties are very afraid of sting operations, probably that’s why they are not involving themselves directly into any kind of horse trading,” said Nirdaliya, blaming the anti-sentiments wave, “It is then, a friend of mine suggested name of Shri Rajiv Shukla as the only person who could help me to get best deal.”

Sources close to the power corridors say that Shri Shukla was initially reluctant, but later when Nirdaliya begged and reminded him of his actual duties, Rajiv agreed.

“If you are doctor, it’s your duty to help the patient even if he is your enemy. I am a gifted man and have been blessed with talent of negotiations, I can’t let it go waste. Delhi needs me, my country needs me,” declared a spirited Rajiv Shukla.

“Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula, khun nahi woh paani hai, jo is desh ke kaam na aaye, woh bekar jawani hai,” he added.

Reportedly, Rajiv Shukla has already started the process of auction which will take place in a completely legal way.

A close aide of Shukla revealed that it will not be Nirdaliya Sharma who is going to be auctioned, it will be his shoes. Party placing the highest bid on the shoes will become owner of the shoes, and informally, of its owner.

While it appears a perfect plan, experts are not sure if this is going to work.

“Both BJP and AAP are not interested in forming the government, while Congress can’t even if it buys the MLA. I think this is not going to help,” an expert said.

But Rajiv Shukla has factored that in.

“Auction will take place at a 5 star hotel and few companies, mainly shoe brands like Adidas and Nike have agreed to sponsor the event,” he said, “If nothing, we will earn sponsorship revenues as TV is only talking about Delhi elections these days.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajiv_Shukla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/independent-mla-from-delhi-asks-rajiv-shukla-to-help-him-get-auctioned-ipl-style-4258,Independent MLA from Delhi asks Rajiv Shukla to help him get auctioned IPL style,,1386676525.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Since all the earlier celebrities, who joined his fast two years ago, have now become AAP supporters, the private celebrity citizen Robert Vadra has decided to join Anna Hazare in his latest fast demanding Jan Lokpal Bill.

Vadra, unfairly targeted for becoming rich even though he had all the rights to given his family connections, aims to improve his public image and win public support.

The next politician is born?

The small farmer took this decision after witnessing Congress rout in 4 states in the recently concluded assembly elections. Later he saw his brother-in-law claiming that he was willing to learn from AAP, and that alerted him.

“Did it mean that even Rahul Gandhi was going to organize press conferences and attack Vadra, while giving a clean chit to the rest of the family?” a close aide of Vadra told Faking News why the talented entrepreneur was worried.

To secure his personal future and wealth, Vadra decided that he would too learn from AAP and declared his support for Anna Hazare.

“AAP has declared that their next target would be Haryana, where they are wooing IAS officer Ashok Khemka to join them. Vadra is getting ready for the challenge,” Vadra’s aide explained, “He is learning from Kejriwal and planning to gain from Anna’s goodwill.”

As part of this strategy, Robert Vadra will soon fly to Ralegan Siddhi to join Anna. He has even offered to build a grand DLF Mall in Ralegan Siddhi if the clauses of Jan Lokpal Bill are modified to exclude him, just like he’s excluded from security checks at airports.

“I think he will announce formation of Khas Aadmi Party at the end of this fast by Anna and fight elections in Haryana against Aam Aadmi Party. While AAP can get some urban votes, rural votes will surely go to Vadra because his party will be called KHAP,” a political expert claimed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robert_Vadra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-to-join-annas-latest-fast-to-improve-his-image-4256,Robert Vadra to join Anna’s latest fast to improve his image,,1386671209.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fed up with BJP’s and AAP’s “pahle aap, pahle aap” attitude where they are offering each other the chance to lay a claim on government formation, Election Commission announced another election between both the parties to decide who will sit in opposition.

Gearing up for ‘Broom 2’

This special “opposition selection election” will take place on 17th of December, in which only BJP and AAP will be contesting.

“It’s a very awkward situation, as both the parties holding the public mandate are willing to be in opposition. Such a love for being in opposition is unheard of in parliamentary democracy,” said the Chief Election Commissioner of India, “That’s why we decided to take public help to end this love lock.”

In this special election, the party getting more seats will be sitting in opposition and the loser will have to go ahead and lay a claim on government formation based on the number of seats they won in the 4th December held assembly polls.

After EC’s statement, party workers of both BJP and AAP have restarted their campaign, but this time with a slightly different agenda in mind.

“We are asking people to vote in our favor to keep us away from power,” said an excited AAP member with a broom tied around his neck.

“Jo jeet ke bhi haaar jaaye use ‘Baazigar Inverse’ kahte hain,” he quipped, which was quickly shared as tweets and Facebook updates by other AAP supporters.

Since the elections would be almost a MTV Roadies like vote-out, AAP has requested hosts Raghu and Rajv to campaign for them again, while BJP has asked Vijay Jolly to put black ink on every Delhi voter’s nameplate so that Delhi residents give them a chance to sit in opposition.

Eyeing a revenge against team Kejriwal, Congress party has offered its full support to AAP.

“We will vote for AAP and force them to form the government with our outside support.

Pappu, a boy studying in the 6th standard of Rajiv Gandhi Higher Secondary school has credited Rahul Gandhi’s leadership for failing continuously in exams and class tests for one year now.

Pappu has claimed that he had been watching Rahul Gandhi rallies and got so addicted to them that he did not get time to study and prepare for the test.

A very inspiring pose of Rahul Gandhi

Sources say that Pappu’s parents had threatened to send him to a boarding school if he failed again. To escape going to boarding school, Pappu reportedly came up with this idea.

“He knew that his father was a diehard Congress supporter and a fan of Nehru-Gandhi family, and he would never accept any performance as failure if it happened under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” Digvijay Chaudhari, class teacher of Pappu told Faking News.

Following this strategy, Pappu went and told his father this morning that the 14 marks that he got out of 100 in mathematics were obtained under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

As expected, Pappu’s papa hugged his son and told him not to worry as he was still young and had a long career in front of him, just like Rahul Gandhi.

“Furthermore, 14 out of 100 is an improvement from the last test where he got 8,” Pappu’s papa is reported to have told him.

Later, when Pappu’s mummy told both of them to stop fooling around and wake up to the reality, Pappu’s father said, “It is a moment of deep introspection. The education system in India needs an aggressive transformation.”

Pappu too latched on to the opportunity and promised that he would get passing marks in a matter his parents can’t even imagine.

Meanwhile Pappu’s classmate Raju Shukla, who also is the non-playing captain of the school cricket team, came down heavily on Pappu for committing such a blasphemy.

“Even I got 3 marks and failed. But I take complete responsibility for it and thank Rahul Gandhi ji. Had it not for him, I wouldn’t have got even 3 marks,” Raju said.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"New Delhi. Eminent Indian physicist Dr. N.C.R Rao has been conferred the Nobel Prize for Physics for his path-breaking research on the properties of “Modi wave”.

In his paper submitted to the Nobel committee, a copy of which is available with Faking News, Dr. Rao has established that Narendra Modi, like light, has dual nature and acts as both a particle and a wave.

Unconfirmed sources have suggested that Dr Rao was selected for the prestigious award by the same panel that had given the Nobel Peace prize to Barack Obama in 2009.

Dr Rao – A physicist, not a political scientist.

“I was intrigued by the Congress spokespersons on TV who said they did not see any Modi wave in-spite of the BJP winning 3 of the 4 Assembly Elections and emerging as the single largest party in the other,” Dr Rao told Faking News, “So, I requested my friend, Yogendra Yadav, for raw data of the elections and began running simulations to explain this strange phenomenon.”

“While several of my initial experiments were inconclusive, I stumbled upon this idea while streaming episodes of The Big Bang Theory on YouTube during my lunch break,” added Dr Rao.

Spurred on by this lucky break, he spent the next few weeks confined to his lab and finally emerged with experimental results and mathematical proof validating his theory.

Dr. Rao addressed the media at this office yesterday and said, “The Congress leaders have lost touch with the present and are stuck in the outdated wave theory. Therefore, they could not detect the Modi particles which were present in abundant quantities all around them.”

Meanwhile in a controversial move, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a PIL in the Supreme court asking for a Bharat Ratna for Mr Rao. Dr. Swamy also alleged that a multi-billion dollar Modi wave detector scam was being covered up at behest of the Gandhi family and has called for a CBI enquiry into this.

Speaking on this issue, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Manish Tewari told Faking News that Mr Rao’s theory needs to be examined holistically to check for the presence of any aberrant techniques of confabulation intended to obfuscate the truth.

While BJP has hailed Dr. Rao’s research, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lashed out at Dr. Rao for ignoring the secularism wave and demanded a special status for it. Dr. Rao has so far declined to comment on this.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Scientist.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"Scientist explains ‘missing’ Modi wave, gets Nobel prize",,1386578053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The meeting took at Sonia Gandhi’s residence. This Faking News reporter could record the proceedings using a camera hidden in Kapil Sibal’s eyebrows. Following is the highlights of the discussion:

Rajiv Shukla (almost shouting): On your feet, Noor-e-Hindustan, Brand-Ambassador-e-Dimple Shri Rahul Gandhi ji is coming. There is no Modi wave, Rahul Gandhi ji got a shave!

Rahul Gandhi asking Sonia Gandhi if he should rename Congress as Aam Aadmi’s Big Party

(Rahul Gandhi enters with Sonia Gandhi)

Rahul Gandhi: Thanks Shukla ji. We need to learn from AAP, and I can see that you have learnt poetry from Kumar Vishvas. I’m impressed. Sibal ji, you should also learn poetry from him.

Kapil Sibal: I already have a poem for you Rahul baba – “Maybe no one turns up in rallies but your speeches are cute, maybe Congress has crashed in elections but you are parachute!”

(everyone claps)

Rahul Gandhi: Good show! We need to learn more from AAP. But first let’s find out why we lost the elections. Clearly, I’m not responsible, right?

Rajiv Shukla: Yes, Rahul ji, you are not responsible. If you want, I can take full responsibility and give a public statement.

Sonia Gandhi: No Shuks, nobody will give any importance to your comment. And anyway, we are here for analysis of defeat, not to check loyalty. Let’s first talk about Rajasthan. Ashok Gehlot has shocked me by claiming central policies were responsible. He has refused to take blame, and Rahul is not responsible. Now someone from center has to take blame.

Kapil Sibal: Madam, I think our tough stand on IT laws backfired. Gehlot ji had a lot of non-resident Rajasthani supporters in Turkey, which was quite visible on his Facebook page. But I have heard that they were quite upset about our stand on cyber regulation and they didn’t show up during voting.

Sonia Gandhi: So you take responsibility for Rajasthan?

Kapil Sibal: Yes ma’am. “I am responsible. Gehlot is gullible. Results horrible. Twinkle twinkle.”

Rahul Gandhi: wow… good poem!

Sonia Gandhi: Ok, what about Madhya Pradesh? Digvijay ji, you disappointed us.

Digvijay Singh: Madam ji, this time I bet, RSS is behind it.

Rahul Gandhi: But uncle, RSS is not part of Congress, we need someone from the party to accept the responsibility.

Digvijay Singh: This Jyotiraditya Scindia should take responsibility.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Abey chup!

Sonia Gandhi: Please, maintain decorum. We have to respect people, except Narendra Modi.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Sorry, but I’m not going to take responsibility. Kamal Nath ji or Digvijay Singh ji should take blame.

Digvijay Singh: I can’t take blame. I only blame RSS.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: (mumbles something again)

Digvijay Singh: Let’s blame Electronic Voting Machines.

Sonia Gandhi: I think this is not going anywhere.

Kapil Sibal: I can take blame for this too if these guys are not willing to. It will mean zero loss to me.

Sonia Gandhi: Great. Zero loss to our rescue again. Now Chhatisgarh.

Ajit Jogi: Madam, can we blame it on our leaders who died in Naxal attack? We anyway blame leaders after they die, like Narsimha Rao ji.

Sonia Gandhi: Jogi ji, are you drunk?

Ajit Jogi: Sorry madam, I take responsibility.

Sonia Gandhi: That was quick. Now let’s move to Delhi. What happened Sheila ji?

Sheila Dixit: Rahul ji has already said it was AAP factor and he will learn from AAP.

Sonia Gandhi: Yes, but we need someone to take the blame. Are you taking the responsibility?

Sheila Dixit: I don’t know. I always maintained that I was not responsible for Delhi’s law and order as it was under center’s control, or not responsible for roads as MCD was under BJP control, or responsible for corruption in CWG. Now how do I take responsibility for this?

Sonia Gandhi: But someone have to.

Digvijay Singh: I don’t know why are we not blaming Narendra Modi!

Sonia Gandhi: What has happened to you Digvijay ji? If we blame Narendra Modi, it means we are accepting there is a Modi wave!

Rahul Gandhi: But that’s alright mamma. We live in Delhi, which is far far away from seashore and we shouldn’t fear any wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Diggi! Look what you have done to Rahul baba’s thinking!

(Digvijay Singh is taken aback and keeps silent)

Sonia Gandhi: Silence will not work! Not a time to be silent. You have to take the blame.

Manmohan Singh: Theek hai. (on cue at the mention of “silence”)

Soon after giving a controversial statement about how he was afraid of talking to women, Union Minister Farooq Abdullah gave another shocker by revealing that he was afraid to talk about Article 370 of the Indian constitution even more.

Abdullah said that he and his men were scared to talk about the undebatable article as they fear that they may end up in opposition, which is worse than going to jail.

The scared Abdullah

“Look at Tarun Tejpal, he might be in jail, but he’s getting all the support. Now contrast it when he was in opposition i.e. when NDA was in power; he was almost bankrupt!” a close aide of senior Abdullah explained.

Aides say that this was the reason (scared of being in opposition) National Conference didn’t walk out of NDA even after 2002 Gujarat riots, though later they blamed it all on Narendra Modi after losing the elections.

“Now Modi is haunting them again by raking Article 370,” the aide added.

While senior Abdullah didn’t comment on above explanations and speculations, he conceded that he was in no mood to discuss women and Article 370.

“It is not like I am blaming Article 370, I am blaming society itself. The way this article impacts local elections is the main cause of fear,” he said.

“This Artcile 370 is even more complicated than a woman,” senior Abdullah further added, which immediately caused outrage on Twitter and TV channels.

While Farooq Abdullah might be drawing flak for his comments, many in Jammu & Kashmir agree with him.

“I am 48 years old and till now have never ever debated about 370 article,” said a local leader Balwan Khan, explaining how afraid he is to even touch the topic.

“It is about local culture. People in Delhi should respect our opinions and not thrust their ideas of right and wrong on us,” another local leader supported Farooq Abdullah.

Kartik, a resident of Karol Bagh was detained for questioning by police after a failed attempt to vote twice. Officials say that after casting his original vote, Kartik was trying to cast vote even for his fake Facebook profile.

“It is not a traditional case of proxy voting or booth capturing, it’s a case which has much to do with how the virtual lives of people are impacting their real lives,” said Delhi police commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi.

One of the pictures liked by Kartik from both his Facebook profiles

“Kartik was living a dual cyber life – one of his own, and other of the fake account he created with the same name. He was so obsessed with his fake Kartik profile that he started believing as if he were two persons instead of one. In short, he was suffering from split personality disorder,” the commissioner explained.

Sources (fake profiles of girls added to both the accounts of Kartik) say that Kartik was a devoted AAP activist on his original profile, while on his fake profile he was a staunch BJP supporter and a diehard Narendra Modi fan.

“It’s not surprising. Many surveys have revealed that there are people in Delhi who are supporting BJP at center but AAP in the local assembly election, but we never knew this dual support could lead to dual personality,” said Jay Prakash Narain, a political expert.

Police sources say that after voting for AAP in the morning, Kartik returned to his home and logged into Facebook to put pictures of his blue inked finger. Later, out of habit, he also logged into his fake profile, and that’s when he felt an insuppressible urge to vote for BJP too.

“He came back home, went to his bedroom, and after half an hour, he said he was going to finish a pending work,” revealed Kartik’s mother. About an hour later, she got the news of her son being detained by the police.

As Ravi Shastri would say, “all three four results are possible” in Delhi assembly elections. It could go AAP, BJP, or Congress way, or there could be hung assembly.

Faking News has found from its sources, what will these parties say when election results are announced. They have already weighed in various results:

Scenario 1: AAP wins clear majority

AAP: We told you! Our internal survey says we will form next government at center too. BJP: This clearly shows that people with huge support on Twitter and Facebook are winning. Narendra Modi will be the next Prime Minister. Congress: This clearly shows that people supported by the youth are winning. Congress will form the next government under leadership of Youth Icon Rahul Gandhi.

Scenario 2: BJP wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: WE RULE THE WORLD! Congress: AAP was planted by BJP to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji, we will defeat them in general elections.

Scenario 3: Congress wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: AAP was planted by Congress to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that due to the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji and Narendra Modi ji, we will defeat them in general elections.

In a new case of ‘Bribe for Vote’ incident, a new sting operation carried out by a party that specializes in exposés has revealed that political parties were targeting online gaming addicts and giving free high speed broadband internet connection to them.

Experts believe that given the ever increasing population of gaming addicts by the day, many secular parties are rethinking their strategies and thinking of them as their new vote bank.

Manifesto appealing to a gamer

Sources tell that the political parties decided to take this route after ‘liquor for vote’ became too predictable and media started reporting about it.

“There was also the risk of people not turning up due to hangover,” a leader confirmed why his party decided to offer 10 Mbps broadband instead of bottles of rum.

“We thought we will target alcoholics and exploit their weakness, but yesterday when I saw my own son (a counter strike addict) become violent and later unconscious when his broadband had a downtime of 4 seconds, I realized that gamers in the age group of 18-27 can be lured more easily than anyone else. Liquor addiction is nothing when compared to gaming addiction,” added the leader, whose son converted everyone in his “clan” as voters for his dad’s party.

According to sources, there are around 15 lakh odd gamers in Delhi and political parties believe that this group can impact the results in the triangular fight between Congress, BJP, and AAP.

This whole new revelation has left Yogendra Yadav of AAP totally shattered.

“We did millions of internal surveys but failed to do one that tells us the population of gamers in Delhi. Had we known they are so large in numbers, we would have had something for them as well in our manifesto,” said Yadav.

In order to make amends, AAP has now assured cheat code free gaming experience to honest gamers if voted to power. They have further promised to pass GameLokpal biill within 15 days which will punish cheaters.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gaming.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-parties-give-high-speed-internet-to-gaming-addicts-in-return-for-vote-4204,Political parties give high speed internet to gaming addicts in return for vote,,1386148336.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fearing that all the exposes and protests that they excel at and are so used to doing would soon become a thing of past, AAP has decided to include their continuity as the last and final condition in front of Congress before they agree to form a government in the city.

Both Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwaas signalling number of demands they would make after this.

“It is our forte and something for which people of Delhi have reposed their faith in us. Therefore we cannot stop doing it,” Arvind Kejriwal confirmed at a media gathering.

“We are still unsure whether to expose our own Govt or the opposition after coming to power. To solve that confusion, Yogendra Yadav ji is already conducting internal surveys,” Kejriwal further added.

Sources say as soon as Delhi elections results came out in open, there was joy as well as a tinge of sadness in the AAP camp. They became nostalgic and started crying like a student whose last day in a carefree college life has ended and is now staring at a life full of responsibility and accountability.

“It was all fun while it lasted. Those shocking revelations, all round allegations, complaints with the system; those were the best days of our life, back in the summer of three plus nine (2012),” said Kumar Vishwaas in his inimitable style albeit in English.

The news from Congress camp is that it has agreed to the demand in unequivocal terms. “We are so used to the exposes and protests done by AAP now that some of our leaders had already started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms ever since our government was defeated in capital. We look forward to getting exposed again by AAP under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi ji,” Ahmed Patel told Faking News.

However this latest acceptance of their demand has created panic in AAP camp and they have hired IIM pass outs to help them put up a demand that Congress will never agree upon.

Meanwhile experts feel that even if AAP somehow exposes itself, Arvind Kejriwal will call it a failure and exposure of Aam Aadmi and not his own.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kejriwal_window_reuters_360x270.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aap-demands-they-be-allowed-to-continue-to-expose-and-protest-even-after-forming-a-government-4297,AAP demands they be allowed to continue to expose and protest even after forming a government,,1387269881.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a major decision which is going to change the way people look at natural resources, Government of India has declared ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ a natural resource and has created rules to regulate its usage like any other natural resources.

Government’s initiative is inspired from a report published by a leading investment bank which points out recent events where ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ yielded huge profits for people involved.

AAP – One of the top gainers.

Be it Chennai Express’ box office performance or AAP’s grand debut in Delhi elections, both have a ‘Aam Aadmi’ connection. While the former capitalized on famous dialogue ‘Dont Underestimate The Power Of A Common Man’, the latter’s whole agenda was around Aam Aadmi and even Salman’s coming movie ‘Jai Ho’ is using a ‘Aam Aadmi’ centric dialogue in its trailer, says the report explaining business potential of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.

“It’s a good opportunity for government to generate some extra revenue. We have already witnessed its power and can’t distribute it for free. And above all it’s a renewable source,” told Kapil Sibal while talking to media at a press conference.

“From now on, people using the term ‘Aam Aadmi’ for their personal benefit must pay accordingly,” Sibal added further.

Each year, central government will be issuing license to use ‘Aam Aadmi’ term to movie makers, political parties, news channels and other similar establishments depending on worth of their projects.

As per allocation rules, getting a license of using ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ is lower in rural areas as they are not that close to internet and TV. While in urban areas, license cost is much higher.

Sources say that one of the triggers that compelled government to take this decision was a CAG report that said, Congress party suffered from a notional loss of around rupees 5000 crore by letting AAP use the ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ free of cost.

“In Delhi, AAP used it in a monopolistic way. Had it been under government control, it wouldn’t have been possible for a new party like AAP to pay the huge license amount of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’. This drove Congress MLAs out of power and it will result in a loss of around 5k crore to Congress over next next five years,” said an ex-MLA from Delhi.

Government is also looking to channelize ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’ in order to generate energy.

“Many times it happens that people are angry with government and they want to yell and abuse us which they do on Twitter and Facebook. So we will be creating ‘Anger Venting Hall’ in each city where people could come and simply yell and that sound energy will be converted into other forms of energy,” revealed a senior government official talking about future prospects of ‘Aam Aadmi Sentiment’.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AamAadmiSentiment.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-declares-aam-aadmi-sentiment-a-natural-resource-will-regulate-its-usage-4293,"Government declares 'Aam Aadmi Sentiment' a natural resource, will regulate its usage",,1387191812.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“These days political parties are very afraid of sting operations, probably that’s why they are not involving themselves directly into any kind of horse trading,” said Nirdaliya, blaming the anti-sentiments wave, “It is then, a friend of mine suggested name of Shri Rajiv Shukla as the only person who could help me to get best deal.”

Sources close to the power corridors say that Shri Shukla was initially reluctant, but later when Nirdaliya begged and reminded him of his actual duties, Rajiv agreed.

“If you are doctor, it’s your duty to help the patient even if he is your enemy. I am a gifted man and have been blessed with talent of negotiations, I can’t let it go waste. Delhi needs me, my country needs me,” declared a spirited Rajiv Shukla.

“Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula, khun nahi woh paani hai, jo is desh ke kaam na aaye, woh bekar jawani hai,” he added.

Reportedly, Rajiv Shukla has already started the process of auction which will take place in a completely legal way.

A close aide of Shukla revealed that it will not be Nirdaliya Sharma who is going to be auctioned, it will be his shoes. Party placing the highest bid on the shoes will become owner of the shoes, and informally, of its owner.

While it appears a perfect plan, experts are not sure if this is going to work.

“Both BJP and AAP are not interested in forming the government, while Congress can’t even if it buys the MLA. I think this is not going to help,” an expert said.

But Rajiv Shukla has factored that in.

“Auction will take place at a 5 star hotel and few companies, mainly shoe brands like Adidas and Nike have agreed to sponsor the event,” he said, “If nothing, we will earn sponsorship revenues as TV is only talking about Delhi elections these days.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajiv_Shukla.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/independent-mla-from-delhi-asks-rajiv-shukla-to-help-him-get-auctioned-ipl-style-4258,Independent MLA from Delhi asks Rajiv Shukla to help him get auctioned IPL style,,1386676525.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Since all the earlier celebrities, who joined his fast two years ago, have now become AAP supporters, the private celebrity citizen Robert Vadra has decided to join Anna Hazare in his latest fast demanding Jan Lokpal Bill.

Vadra, unfairly targeted for becoming rich even though he had all the rights to given his family connections, aims to improve his public image and win public support.

The next politician is born?

The small farmer took this decision after witnessing Congress rout in 4 states in the recently concluded assembly elections. Later he saw his brother-in-law claiming that he was willing to learn from AAP, and that alerted him.

“Did it mean that even Rahul Gandhi was going to organize press conferences and attack Vadra, while giving a clean chit to the rest of the family?” a close aide of Vadra told Faking News why the talented entrepreneur was worried.

To secure his personal future and wealth, Vadra decided that he would too learn from AAP and declared his support for Anna Hazare.

“AAP has declared that their next target would be Haryana, where they are wooing IAS officer Ashok Khemka to join them. Vadra is getting ready for the challenge,” Vadra’s aide explained, “He is learning from Kejriwal and planning to gain from Anna’s goodwill.”

As part of this strategy, Robert Vadra will soon fly to Ralegan Siddhi to join Anna. He has even offered to build a grand DLF Mall in Ralegan Siddhi if the clauses of Jan Lokpal Bill are modified to exclude him, just like he’s excluded from security checks at airports.

“I think he will announce formation of Khas Aadmi Party at the end of this fast by Anna and fight elections in Haryana against Aam Aadmi Party. While AAP can get some urban votes, rural votes will surely go to Vadra because his party will be called KHAP,” a political expert claimed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robert_Vadra.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-to-join-annas-latest-fast-to-improve-his-image-4256,Robert Vadra to join Anna’s latest fast to improve his image,,1386671209.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Fed up with BJP’s and AAP’s “pahle aap, pahle aap” attitude where they are offering each other the chance to lay a claim on government formation, Election Commission announced another election between both the parties to decide who will sit in opposition.

Gearing up for ‘Broom 2’

This special “opposition selection election” will take place on 17th of December, in which only BJP and AAP will be contesting.

“It’s a very awkward situation, as both the parties holding the public mandate are willing to be in opposition. Such a love for being in opposition is unheard of in parliamentary democracy,” said the Chief Election Commissioner of India, “That’s why we decided to take public help to end this love lock.”

In this special election, the party getting more seats will be sitting in opposition and the loser will have to go ahead and lay a claim on government formation based on the number of seats they won in the 4th December held assembly polls.

After EC’s statement, party workers of both BJP and AAP have restarted their campaign, but this time with a slightly different agenda in mind.

“We are asking people to vote in our favor to keep us away from power,” said an excited AAP member with a broom tied around his neck.

“Jo jeet ke bhi haaar jaaye use ‘Baazigar Inverse’ kahte hain,” he quipped, which was quickly shared as tweets and Facebook updates by other AAP supporters.

Since the elections would be almost a MTV Roadies like vote-out, AAP has requested hosts Raghu and Rajv to campaign for them again, while BJP has asked Vijay Jolly to put black ink on every Delhi voter’s nameplate so that Delhi residents give them a chance to sit in opposition.

Eyeing a revenge against team Kejriwal, Congress party has offered its full support to AAP.

“We will vote for AAP and force them to form the government with our outside support.

Pappu, a boy studying in the 6th standard of Rajiv Gandhi Higher Secondary school has credited Rahul Gandhi’s leadership for failing continuously in exams and class tests for one year now.

Pappu has claimed that he had been watching Rahul Gandhi rallies and got so addicted to them that he did not get time to study and prepare for the test.

A very inspiring pose of Rahul Gandhi

Sources say that Pappu’s parents had threatened to send him to a boarding school if he failed again. To escape going to boarding school, Pappu reportedly came up with this idea.

“He knew that his father was a diehard Congress supporter and a fan of Nehru-Gandhi family, and he would never accept any performance as failure if it happened under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” Digvijay Chaudhari, class teacher of Pappu told Faking News.

Following this strategy, Pappu went and told his father this morning that the 14 marks that he got out of 100 in mathematics were obtained under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

As expected, Pappu’s papa hugged his son and told him not to worry as he was still young and had a long career in front of him, just like Rahul Gandhi.

“Furthermore, 14 out of 100 is an improvement from the last test where he got 8,” Pappu’s papa is reported to have told him.

Later, when Pappu’s mummy told both of them to stop fooling around and wake up to the reality, Pappu’s father said, “It is a moment of deep introspection. The education system in India needs an aggressive transformation.”

Pappu too latched on to the opportunity and promised that he would get passing marks in a matter his parents can’t even imagine.

Meanwhile Pappu’s classmate Raju Shukla, who also is the non-playing captain of the school cricket team, came down heavily on Pappu for committing such a blasphemy.

“Even I got 3 marks and failed. But I take complete responsibility for it and thank Rahul Gandhi ji. Had it not for him, I wouldn’t have got even 3 marks,” Raju said.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"New Delhi. Eminent Indian physicist Dr. N.C.R Rao has been conferred the Nobel Prize for Physics for his path-breaking research on the properties of “Modi wave”.

In his paper submitted to the Nobel committee, a copy of which is available with Faking News, Dr. Rao has established that Narendra Modi, like light, has dual nature and acts as both a particle and a wave.

Unconfirmed sources have suggested that Dr Rao was selected for the prestigious award by the same panel that had given the Nobel Peace prize to Barack Obama in 2009.

Dr Rao – A physicist, not a political scientist.

“I was intrigued by the Congress spokespersons on TV who said they did not see any Modi wave in-spite of the BJP winning 3 of the 4 Assembly Elections and emerging as the single largest party in the other,” Dr Rao told Faking News, “So, I requested my friend, Yogendra Yadav, for raw data of the elections and began running simulations to explain this strange phenomenon.”

“While several of my initial experiments were inconclusive, I stumbled upon this idea while streaming episodes of The Big Bang Theory on YouTube during my lunch break,” added Dr Rao.

Spurred on by this lucky break, he spent the next few weeks confined to his lab and finally emerged with experimental results and mathematical proof validating his theory.

Dr. Rao addressed the media at this office yesterday and said, “The Congress leaders have lost touch with the present and are stuck in the outdated wave theory. Therefore, they could not detect the Modi particles which were present in abundant quantities all around them.”

Meanwhile in a controversial move, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a PIL in the Supreme court asking for a Bharat Ratna for Mr Rao. Dr. Swamy also alleged that a multi-billion dollar Modi wave detector scam was being covered up at behest of the Gandhi family and has called for a CBI enquiry into this.

Speaking on this issue, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Manish Tewari told Faking News that Mr Rao’s theory needs to be examined holistically to check for the presence of any aberrant techniques of confabulation intended to obfuscate the truth.

While BJP has hailed Dr. Rao’s research, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lashed out at Dr. Rao for ignoring the secularism wave and demanded a special status for it. Dr. Rao has so far declined to comment on this.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Scientist.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scientist-explains-missing-modi-wave-gets-nobel-prize-4246,"Scientist explains ‘missing’ Modi wave, gets Nobel prize",,1386578053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The meeting took at Sonia Gandhi’s residence. This Faking News reporter could record the proceedings using a camera hidden in Kapil Sibal’s eyebrows. Following is the highlights of the discussion:

Rajiv Shukla (almost shouting): On your feet, Noor-e-Hindustan, Brand-Ambassador-e-Dimple Shri Rahul Gandhi ji is coming. There is no Modi wave, Rahul Gandhi ji got a shave!

Rahul Gandhi asking Sonia Gandhi if he should rename Congress as Aam Aadmi’s Big Party

(Rahul Gandhi enters with Sonia Gandhi)

Rahul Gandhi: Thanks Shukla ji. We need to learn from AAP, and I can see that you have learnt poetry from Kumar Vishvas. I’m impressed. Sibal ji, you should also learn poetry from him.

Kapil Sibal: I already have a poem for you Rahul baba – “Maybe no one turns up in rallies but your speeches are cute, maybe Congress has crashed in elections but you are parachute!”

(everyone claps)

Rahul Gandhi: Good show! We need to learn more from AAP. But first let’s find out why we lost the elections. Clearly, I’m not responsible, right?

Rajiv Shukla: Yes, Rahul ji, you are not responsible. If you want, I can take full responsibility and give a public statement.

Sonia Gandhi: No Shuks, nobody will give any importance to your comment. And anyway, we are here for analysis of defeat, not to check loyalty. Let’s first talk about Rajasthan. Ashok Gehlot has shocked me by claiming central policies were responsible. He has refused to take blame, and Rahul is not responsible. Now someone from center has to take blame.

Kapil Sibal: Madam, I think our tough stand on IT laws backfired. Gehlot ji had a lot of non-resident Rajasthani supporters in Turkey, which was quite visible on his Facebook page. But I have heard that they were quite upset about our stand on cyber regulation and they didn’t show up during voting.

Sonia Gandhi: So you take responsibility for Rajasthan?

Kapil Sibal: Yes ma’am. “I am responsible. Gehlot is gullible. Results horrible. Twinkle twinkle.”

Rahul Gandhi: wow… good poem!

Sonia Gandhi: Ok, what about Madhya Pradesh? Digvijay ji, you disappointed us.

Digvijay Singh: Madam ji, this time I bet, RSS is behind it.

Rahul Gandhi: But uncle, RSS is not part of Congress, we need someone from the party to accept the responsibility.

Digvijay Singh: This Jyotiraditya Scindia should take responsibility.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Abey chup!

Sonia Gandhi: Please, maintain decorum. We have to respect people, except Narendra Modi.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: Sorry, but I’m not going to take responsibility. Kamal Nath ji or Digvijay Singh ji should take blame.

Digvijay Singh: I can’t take blame. I only blame RSS.

Jyotiraditya Scindia: (mumbles something again)

Digvijay Singh: Let’s blame Electronic Voting Machines.

Sonia Gandhi: I think this is not going anywhere.

Kapil Sibal: I can take blame for this too if these guys are not willing to. It will mean zero loss to me.

Sonia Gandhi: Great. Zero loss to our rescue again. Now Chhatisgarh.

Ajit Jogi: Madam, can we blame it on our leaders who died in Naxal attack? We anyway blame leaders after they die, like Narsimha Rao ji.

Sonia Gandhi: Jogi ji, are you drunk?

Ajit Jogi: Sorry madam, I take responsibility.

Sonia Gandhi: That was quick. Now let’s move to Delhi. What happened Sheila ji?

Sheila Dixit: Rahul ji has already said it was AAP factor and he will learn from AAP.

Sonia Gandhi: Yes, but we need someone to take the blame. Are you taking the responsibility?

Sheila Dixit: I don’t know. I always maintained that I was not responsible for Delhi’s law and order as it was under center’s control, or not responsible for roads as MCD was under BJP control, or responsible for corruption in CWG. Now how do I take responsibility for this?

Sonia Gandhi: But someone have to.

Digvijay Singh: I don’t know why are we not blaming Narendra Modi!

Sonia Gandhi: What has happened to you Digvijay ji? If we blame Narendra Modi, it means we are accepting there is a Modi wave!

Rahul Gandhi: But that’s alright mamma. We live in Delhi, which is far far away from seashore and we shouldn’t fear any wave.

Sonia Gandhi: Diggi! Look what you have done to Rahul baba’s thinking!

(Digvijay Singh is taken aback and keeps silent)

Sonia Gandhi: Silence will not work! Not a time to be silent. You have to take the blame.

Manmohan Singh: Theek hai. (on cue at the mention of “silence”)

Soon after giving a controversial statement about how he was afraid of talking to women, Union Minister Farooq Abdullah gave another shocker by revealing that he was afraid to talk about Article 370 of the Indian constitution even more.

Abdullah said that he and his men were scared to talk about the undebatable article as they fear that they may end up in opposition, which is worse than going to jail.

The scared Abdullah

“Look at Tarun Tejpal, he might be in jail, but he’s getting all the support. Now contrast it when he was in opposition i.e. when NDA was in power; he was almost bankrupt!” a close aide of senior Abdullah explained.

Aides say that this was the reason (scared of being in opposition) National Conference didn’t walk out of NDA even after 2002 Gujarat riots, though later they blamed it all on Narendra Modi after losing the elections.

“Now Modi is haunting them again by raking Article 370,” the aide added.

While senior Abdullah didn’t comment on above explanations and speculations, he conceded that he was in no mood to discuss women and Article 370.

“It is not like I am blaming Article 370, I am blaming society itself. The way this article impacts local elections is the main cause of fear,” he said.

“This Artcile 370 is even more complicated than a woman,” senior Abdullah further added, which immediately caused outrage on Twitter and TV channels.

While Farooq Abdullah might be drawing flak for his comments, many in Jammu & Kashmir agree with him.

“I am 48 years old and till now have never ever debated about 370 article,” said a local leader Balwan Khan, explaining how afraid he is to even touch the topic.

“It is about local culture. People in Delhi should respect our opinions and not thrust their ideas of right and wrong on us,” another local leader supported Farooq Abdullah.

However his son and J&K CM Omar Abdullah has regretted his father’s comment and called it a “misplaced attempt at speaking truth”.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Farooq_Abdullah.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/scared-to-talk-about-article-370-more-than-scared-to-talk-to-women-farooq-abdullah-4226,Scared of talking about Article 370 more than talking to women: Farooq Abdullah,,1386325814.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Kartik, a resident of Karol Bagh was detained for questioning by police after a failed attempt to vote twice. Officials say that after casting his original vote, Kartik was trying to cast vote even for his fake Facebook profile.

“It is not a traditional case of proxy voting or booth capturing, it’s a case which has much to do with how the virtual lives of people are impacting their real lives,” said Delhi police commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi.

One of the pictures liked by Kartik from both his Facebook profiles

“Kartik was living a dual cyber life – one of his own, and other of the fake account he created with the same name. He was so obsessed with his fake Kartik profile that he started believing as if he were two persons instead of one. In short, he was suffering from split personality disorder,” the commissioner explained.

Sources (fake profiles of girls added to both the accounts of Kartik) say that Kartik was a devoted AAP activist on his original profile, while on his fake profile he was a staunch BJP supporter and a diehard Narendra Modi fan.

“It’s not surprising. Many surveys have revealed that there are people in Delhi who are supporting BJP at center but AAP in the local assembly election, but we never knew this dual support could lead to dual personality,” said Jay Prakash Narain, a political expert.

Police sources say that after voting for AAP in the morning, Kartik returned to his home and logged into Facebook to put pictures of his blue inked finger. Later, out of habit, he also logged into his fake profile, and that’s when he felt an insuppressible urge to vote for BJP too.

“He came back home, went to his bedroom, and after half an hour, he said he was going to finish a pending work,” revealed Kartik’s mother. About an hour later, she got the news of her son being detained by the police.

As Ravi Shastri would say, “all three four results are possible” in Delhi assembly elections. It could go AAP, BJP, or Congress way, or there could be hung assembly.

Faking News has found from its sources, what will these parties say when election results are announced. They have already weighed in various results:

Scenario 1: AAP wins clear majority

AAP: We told you! Our internal survey says we will form next government at center too. BJP: This clearly shows that people with huge support on Twitter and Facebook are winning. Narendra Modi will be the next Prime Minister. Congress: This clearly shows that people supported by the youth are winning. Congress will form the next government under leadership of Youth Icon Rahul Gandhi.

Scenario 2: BJP wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: WE RULE THE WORLD! Congress: AAP was planted by BJP to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji, we will defeat them in general elections.

Scenario 3: Congress wins clear majority

AAP: We will educate people about corruption. (We have just sent an SMS to Anna. Guess we still need him.) BJP: AAP was planted by Congress to cut our votes. It’s unfortunate that the voter couldn’t see this gameplan. But we are sure that due to the leadership of Rahul Gandhi ji and Narendra Modi ji, we will defeat them in general elections. Congress: WE RULE THE WORLD!

In a new case of ‘Bribe for Vote’ incident, a new sting operation carried out by a party that specializes in exposés has revealed that political parties were targeting online gaming addicts and giving free high speed broadband internet connection to them.

Experts believe that given the ever increasing population of gaming addicts by the day, many secular parties are rethinking their strategies and thinking of them as their new vote bank.

Manifesto appealing to a gamer

Sources tell that the political parties decided to take this route after ‘liquor for vote’ became too predictable and media started reporting about it.

“There was also the risk of people not turning up due to hangover,” a leader confirmed why his party decided to offer 10 Mbps broadband instead of bottles of rum.

“We thought we will target alcoholics and exploit their weakness, but yesterday when I saw my own son (a counter strike addict) become violent and later unconscious when his broadband had a downtime of 4 seconds, I realized that gamers in the age group of 18-27 can be lured more easily than anyone else. Liquor addiction is nothing when compared to gaming addiction,” added the leader, whose son converted everyone in his “clan” as voters for his dad’s party.

According to sources, there are around 15 lakh odd gamers in Delhi and political parties believe that this group can impact the results in the triangular fight between Congress, BJP, and AAP.

This whole new revelation has left Yogendra Yadav of AAP totally shattered.

“We did millions of internal surveys but failed to do one that tells us the population of gamers in Delhi. Had we known they are so large in numbers, we would have had something for them as well in our manifesto,” said Yadav.

In order to make amends, AAP has now assured cheat code free gaming experience to honest gamers if voted to power. They have further promised to pass GameLokpal biill within 15 days which will punish cheaters.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gaming.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/political-parties-give-high-speed-internet-to-gaming-addicts-in-return-for-vote-4204,Political parties give high speed internet to gaming addicts in return for vote,,1386148336.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

How would these politicians have campaigned? Faking News brings to you their campaign pitches:

Narendra Modi: Here is my mid-term exam report card. I have scored 97 out of 100 marks. Give me a chance to write the final exam and I will score better than this. You might ask me how I scored so much. It is because I drink Gujarat ka doodh, which fills my 56-inch chest with energy and nationalism. Even if a puppy stands under me, I do not realize it because of my huge chest blocking my view.

Youth factor, now going back to school.

Rahul Gandhi: So what if I have got only 5 out of 100 marks? These are empowered scores. But I don’t understand why I got so less marks. On the day of the exam, I woke up in the morning, at night (check this video). And I revised all chapters thoroughly before going to the exam in the morning, at night.

I had written about women and empowerment for more than 10 pages. I had written about 2002 riots with sketches for more than 5 pages. You file an RTI and find out my answers. Something is wrong in this examination system. These report cards are nonsense and must be torn and thrown away.

Prashant Bhushan: I had actually written correct answers to all the questions, and my 25 sheet answer booklet was filled within 2 hours. But due to a referendum, I had to tear 24 sheets out of my booklet and give it to my neighbor. So I ended up getting only 4 out of 100 marks. But this is my personal performance. My friend needs your support. Here comes my friend.

Arvind Kejriwal: I scored just 5 out of 100 because Congress and BJP supporting goons did not allow me to write for more than 10 minutes. They were standing outside the exam hall at a window and making funny faces at me, due to which I returned my answer sheet and I went out of the hall. Let us talk about the crucial issues now. Why did Modi lose 3 marks?

He must have generously donated 1 mark to Reliance, 1 mark to Adani, and 1 mark to Tata. The 97 marks which Modi has got are communal and corrupt. I will apply for revaluation and photocopy of Modi’s answer booklet and prove to you that even the evaluator was corrupt in awarding marks to Modi. I will sit on a dharna on this issue now!

Nitish Kumar: I scored 33 out of 100 marks, but this is a huge achievement because Lalu had scored a big zero in the same exam. Also, please remember that I could score only because I had put tilak on my forehead and was wearing a topi. Today there are people who want to destroy this culture and I will not let it happen. I even kicked out my roomie when he refused to put tilak and topi. My history is also good, which helped me as Class Monitor. Now I want to become the Head Boy.

Lalu Yadav: all this exam wexam is for budbak people. Communal forces are writing obscene things on the blackboard and in the bathroom. Let us drive them out.

Mulayam Singh Yadav: I was given 10 marks in the exam, which caused me to give three ghunsa (blows) to the evaluator. तुअत्त लाइन पे आ गया.

Mayawati: I scored a zero in the board exam, but it was not CBSE board, but CBI board, and that zero means clean chit. Now I’m ready to take the main exam and I will top the exam, if there are no manuwadis checking the paper.

Jayalalithaa: I’ve scored 101 out of 100 marks in all subjects, where papers where checked by my followers. People now want to sit next to me on my bench so that they want to get that extra one mark. Prakash Karat even sat with me for a few minutes before I told him to get lost.

Mamata Banerjee: My report card and marks sheet were stolen by Maoists, but Anna has given me 100 out of 100 in all subjects.

“Keeping in mind that Shinde ji himself is a movie buff, he came up with this plan by his own. He was hugely motivated after watching the movie D-Day, and has been thinking of a grand plan to nab the most wanted terrorist of India,” disclosed a close aide of Shinde on condition of anonymity.

The aide further informed that BCCI had wanted to host IPL in South Africa again, as was done during the last general elections. However, it was Shinde who suggested UAE.

“In fact, the government could have provided security to IPL, but Shinde ji intentionally refused it, making a solid ground for shifting the venue to UAE, where Dawood goes when he gets bored of mujras in Pakistan,” the aide further disclosed.

Shinde is banking upon old habits of Dawood, which include match fixing, which will pull him towards this secret trap called IPL.

“Shnde ji knows Dawood very well,” the aide pointed out.

As per sources, an Indian match-fixer (not Gurunath Meiyeppan or Vindoo Dara Singh) has already been planted as a mole in the inner circles of the D Company, without Dawood’s knowledge.

Not only the undercover match-fixer, Indian secret service agents have also reached major cities of UAE and are doing the groundwork.

“Shinde ji is personally taking care of each and every detail. He himself is undergoing the basic combat training, and most probably will lead the secret service team on the D-Day,” a home ministry official told Faking News.

“From being associated with foot in mouth, he will become an icon of head over shoulders,” the official claimed.

When asked for comments, the Union Home Minister confirmed that such a plan was in place. He thanked Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the opportunity to catch Dawood.

“But don’t tell anyone, we have to plan this in a secret manner,” Shinde said addressing a press conference.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shinde_bond.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ipl-in-uae-a-trap-set-by-shinde-to-catch-dawood-ibrahim-4860,IPL in UAE a trap set by Shinde to catch Dawood Ibrahim,,1394630764.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/samajwadi-party-to-give-a-lok-sabha-ticket-to-a-person-without-any-criminal-record-4856,"Lucknow. Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav today shocked one and all by deciding to give a Lok Sabha ticket to a person without any criminal record to his credit.

Though he has not zeroed in on the candidate, but a massive statewide hunt to find one such person has been ordered by him. Mulayam however warned candidates against approaching CBI by getting carried away due to honesty.

Sources tell Faking News that senior party leaders and workers are worried about party’s prospects post this announcement. Some of them are terming it a suicidal move and fear that the party may lose its USP and charm.

“Heavens wouldn’t have fallen if this decision was not taken. It’s not as if some buffaloes have gone missing or Madhuri has refused to dance. A totally avoidable decision that Netaji should reconsider. He shouldn’t forget his roots,” senior leader Azam Khan said.

“We are a party that doesn’t discriminate against criminals. We have been trying to win their hearts. I will be shattered if this actually happens,” said Kanpur MLA Irfan Solanki, one of the leading activists fighting for inclusive growth of criminals in the society.

Solanki later kidnapped a few doctors to discuss with them if Mulayam Singh Yadav needed some medication.

Sources say that some SP leaders are even threatening to join other party or form a Super Samajwadi Party made of hardcore criminals if Mulayam Singh Yadav didn’t change his decision.

However, experts say it’s quite normal for national parties at times to do complete opposite of their perceived image.

“Well when AAP can give ticket to an ex-IAS officer who reversed Khemka’s orders, why can’t SP give a ticket to person with clean record,” reasoned one such expert.

Meanwhile, unfazed by all the criticism, Mulayam Singh defended this decision.

Countering Modi’s claim that he would work as watchman for five years, Rahul Gandhi today emphasized the need to turn every Indian into watchman in a rally here.

Following Rahul’s remarks, Congress high command has issued an order making it mandatory for all Congressmen to wear watchman cap, at least till elections.

“With You, For You, Always”

“We want to make people feel safe. From now on, security of this country is in our hand, and steadily we will make India a country of watchmen,” claimed Rahul while sporting a watchman cap, “It’s high time that India shed its image of country of snake charmers.”

“Modi is so self-centric that he wants this job of watchman only for himself, but we believe in ‘main nahi, hum‘ philosophy,” Rahul added, taking a jibe at the BJP’s PM candidate.

Senior Congress leaders have hailed Rahul’s decision and called it a visionary move.

“Rahul Ji is trying to remove unemployment from our country. Imagine all Indians as watchman, we are going to be the first country in world to achieve 100% employment,” said party leader Salman Khurshid.

However, on being reminded that people will not be getting paid, Salman Khurshid argued, “Salary is just a state of mind.”

Sources tell Faking News that in order to implement Rahul Gandhi’s ideas, Congress is planning to turn itself into a part-time security agency, with soul aim to serve nation and that too without any fee.

Thousands and thousands of Congress workers are preparing to roam around on roads tonight wearing watchman cap.

“We have asked watchmen in our locality to go on leave till Lok Sabha elections. From here on, we will be handling security,” disclosed an excited party worker, “It will be fun to chase dogs at night.”

Meanwhile, political experts are claiming that the step by Congress is a befitting reply to BJP’s ‘chaiwala‘ agenda.

“Last time BJP hijacked their chaiwala taunt and converted that into their election campaign. This time Congress is trying to topple Modi’s chowkidar agenda,” explained an expert.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RahulGandhiWatchman.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-workers-to-wear-watchman-cap-after-rahul-emphasises-to-turn-everyone-into-watchman-4850,Congress workers to wear watchman cap after Rahul emphasises to turn everyone into watchman,,1394542120.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

While campaigning in a press conference, Kejriwal claimed that it was Modi who misguided him and told him that those RTI activists were dead after he asked Modi about their details.

“Sachaai ke raaste pe takleef toh hoti hi hai ji,” Kejriwal said this some 200 times in the conference.

“Since I was to talk about RTI activists from Gujarat, I requested Modi ji’s office to send me their details. I was first shocked to see Modi himself sending an email to me but was later happy that aakhir ek aam aadmi ne shaasan dula hi diya. However the information in the mail turned out to be wrong,” Kejriwal told media.

“Everybody knows how poor Modi’s history is. He has been under severe criticism for same many times. This time his lack of history knowledge proved costly for me too. Yeh toh wohi baat hui na ji, ki hum toh dubenge hi tumko bhi le dubenge,” Kejriwal went on to add.

Kejriwal however accepted that being an RTI activist himself, he knew how endangered their lives were and thought Modi must be right and all of them must have been murdered by goons.

“And everyone knows that I believe in internet, so I went with Modi’s mail and made the blunder,” Kejriwal further added.

When asked to show the proof of the email sent by Modi, Kejriwal first insisted that a word by an honest person like him should be enough. But when persisted he claimed he trashed it after confusing it for another spam mail from Somnath Bharti.

Meanwhile AAP supporters hailed Kejriwal on Social Media for showing guts to accept his mistake and attacked Modi for his malicious attempt to defame their leader.

Arvind Kejriwal, who reached Gujarat to verify the pictures of Modi ruled state that he saw on Facebook, was hugely disappointed when he found a decent looking Indian metro city instead of New York.

“All of Modi claims are false, there is no development at all in Gujarat. Yesterday, I spent 8 hours of my free time searching for Manhattan in Ahmedabad, where is it? There were only 14-15 storied buildings, not even a single 101 storied building was there. Yahi to scam hai, isi ki to jaanch karni hai,” asserted a disheartened Kejriwal.

Underdeveloped city

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Chief Minister further claimed that he was shocked to see even weather of Gujarat much different from that of New York.

“It’s freezing cold in New York, so I had brought my muffler with me. But surprisingly, temperature here is 32 degrees. Dhokha hua ji aam aadmi ke saath,” Arvind told Faking News.

One of the AAP members, who is accompanying Kejriwal on Gujarat trip, says that like any other common man, AAP chief is also a firm believer of whatever he sees on internet.

“Of late, he has relied upon Facebook and Twitter to gather corruption proofs against top corporate bigwigs and politicians,” the AAP member revealed.

Reportedly, while roaming around in a remote part of Gujarat, Kejriwal thought to take rest on a footpath of a 4 lane highway and he sat down there in full view of media persons.

But to his surprise, some dirt stuck to his trousers exposing the hollow truth of world class road and infrastructure pasted on Facebook by Modi supporters.

Later, he visited a nearby village and found a household using 60 watt tungsten bulb. “That villager wasn’t rich enough to buy a philips CFL. Such widespread poverty turned out to be the final blow which broke Kejriwal’s patience,” disclosed an AAP insider.

Soon after that, Kejriwal declared Modi’s Gujarat model flawed.

A 26-year-old hardcore AAP supporter today broke up with his wife after he caught her in an uncompromising position (eyes riveted on screen) watching Narendra Modi’s rally on TV.

The sight of her enjoying Modi’s speech angered him so much that he immediately asked her to get out of his house, only to later realize that the house was jointly owned by them. Arvind fell short of calling his wife ‘Ambani agent’.

Arvind Sisodia’s friends confirm that there have been many instances in the past when he had more definite reasons to break up with her, but somehow he chose to end the relationship when it came to Modi.

“He was not upset when she flirted with me, or when she failed to wish him on his birthday,” revealed Vijay Kumar, one of the friends of Arvind.

But his wife taking keen interest in Modi provoked Arvind no end, and he decided to call it quits.

Sources say that earlier Arvind Sisodia had gone on a 4-hour fact finding visit to his in-law’s home to verify the claims of his wife that her mayka was the best.

“First of all there is nobody named ‘Vikas’ in her house. She said her house was clean. But I found lot of garbage in their dustbin. She said her father is retired. Then from where did he get a car and scooter to travel in?” Arvind claimed.

When asked how did such things matter in a relationship, the AAP supporter claimed that integrity in life was the most important thing. When this reporter persisted, Arvind claimed that he didn’t even find any proof of love and care in his wife’s mayka.

“She said her parents were in love, but I saw my saas cribbing about my sasur‘s snoring habits,” Arvind disclosed the lack of love he found, “kaun sa pyaar? mujhe toh kahin pyaar nahi dikha. phir yeh kya pyaar karegi?”

Soon after announcing 9 phase Lok Sabha elections schedule, Election Commission of India has requested people not to forget whom they voted for by the time of election results.

“We know that the duration is quite long. I mean long enough for people who will be voting in first phase to forget about their choice of candidate by time of results. That’s why we are advising people to note it down somewhere so that they don’t get confused on result day,” explained Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath.

Write name of the party you voted for behind voter-id card.

“We don’t want them cribbing on the results day that they voted for party X, but party Y won, and thus alleging rigging of the EVMs,” added Mr. Sampath.

Experts are afraid that if appropriate measures are not taken by people, country may witness one the most confused election results day in the history of democracy.

Election Commission has even promised for an emergency helpline number on the results day. “On 16th May, people who would be completely clueless about their candidate selection can call and ask name of party whom they voted for,” said an EC official, “Yes, it violates the secret ballot process, but we don’t want problems thereafter.”

However, many people with weak memories are seeing this prolonged election process as a blessing in disguise. “I will celebrate for the winning party, assuming that I had voted for them,” quipped 70-year-old Madan Khurana, a Delhiite, who will be voting in the first phase.

But surprisingly, most of the political parties are not worried at all.

“The most important thing is to vote. So what if they forget whom they voted for. Even we forget lofty promises that we make during campaigns. There is nothing wrong in this,” said RJD chief Lalu Yadav, motivating people with weak memories, “Do your work without worrying for fruits. Neki kar dariya mein daal.”

Sources tell Faking News that the incident happened last week, but days after found missing, 6 of them returned with Lalu to his cowshed.

Last week, it was a normal weekend trip for Lalu to his cowsheds, when the caretaker of the shed appeared pale and confused. After blaming communal forces for his troubles, Ram Singh, the caretaker, finally broke down and revealed to Lalu that 13 cows were missing for the past 3 days.

Lalu Yadav checking his cows

Lalu is reported to have said “Bhat Day Buck” before realizing that Ram Singh was telling the truth. He immediately checked the remaining cows and made a list of those missing.

After three days of frantic searching, the cows were found to be with Azam Khan, the world famous bovine lover.

Initially, Lalu was too furious with Azam and wanted to convene a press meet to blast him left right and center. However, to save his secular image and to stop communal forces from coming to power, Lalu decided to underplay the law and order situation in Uttar Pradeh.

When this correspondent got in touch with Azam Khan, and asked how did Lalu’s cows land in his cowshed, he said, “This is all ploy and propaganda of Amit Shah and Modi. They are trying to create rift between people of different religions.”

However, this correspondent braved himself into the secret cowshed and interviewed the 7 dissident cows who didn’t return with Lalu.

Sam, leader of the resistance, said, “We are still not getting enough fodder even though we saw invoices raised to buy enough fodder. Also, the air-conditioner was not working properly. One day we read about Azam Khan sahab using police to search for his missing buffaloes. We decided to join him. We are with him. Mooooo!” And the rest of the cows mooed in unison.

Our Bihar reporter interviewed the returned cows. Siddi, the leader of the returned cows, said, “This is a cowspiracy by the Nitish Kumar. We were told by state authorities that we are being shifted to a new cowshed and that Sam urged us to leave our Laluji. But, when we ended up in Azam’s shed, we realized it was a plot by several forces against Lalu ji.

After continuously fumbling with historical facts, latest being the suggestion that Bhagat Singh and friends were jailed in Andaman-Nicobar islands, it has been now found that BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi lacks knowledge about chemistry too.

The truth came out when Modi, while addressing students pursuing graduation in Delhi University, erred in his knowledge about chemical composition of alcohol.

Modi wondering over the chemical locha

While talking passionately about the progress in Gujarat, Modi explained why alcohol is banned there.

“It was not me who has banned alcohol,” Modi said as bewadas Bachelors of Science students cheered, “Gujarat has been a dry state since long to pay tribute to Gandhiji.”

“We Gujaratis are comfortable with meetha, not methanol,” he added, trying to impress students by talking in their language and by using alliteration, but this statement caused a huge controversy exposing Modi’s lack of chemistry knowledge.

“Methanol is not the alcohol we drink, it’s ethanol,” pointed out many experts, many of whom became expert on chemical names only after Modi made the gaffe.

“Methanol is poisonous alcohol, but no wonder Modi talks about it instead of ethanol. What a poisonous mind! Fascist streaks exposed!” claimed a leading journalist.

Not only journalists and experts, political parties too criticized Modi for having such abysmal level of knowledge.

“It is disgraceful that an aspiring PM doesn’t have sound knowledge about Chemistry, which is very vital to be a good PM. And this, after he himself claimed few days back that 2014 polls will be all about chemistry and not mathematics. Shameful!” read the joint statement issued by Congress, AAP and all other secular parties.

“You would be amazed to know the command Rahul Gandhi Ji has over Chemistry. He knows chemical formulas of all the elements and compounds by heart. He invented periodic table,” Sanjay Jha told Faking News.

“Moody sud know tht menthol is wrong and ethenaul is the write answer. Kejariwal knows best kemistry.” read one of the tweets by AAP leader Ashutosh.

A day after Rahul Gandhi was showered with kisses by women in Assam, mosquitoes from Bundelkhand area of Madhya Pradesh have clarified that back in 2008 they too were kissing the Congress Vice President – a compassionate act that Rahul confused for malicious attack.

“Our intention was to kiss Rahul Gandhi, not to harm him. He misinterpreted our love and affection,” said Lui Singh, head of Bundelkhand Mosquito Sangh.

Lui Singh was speaking on behalf of the families and descendants of those 25,000 mosquitoes, who were accused of attacking Rahul Gandhi and spoiling his tour.

Rahul Gandhi being kissed by human beings

“There was a deliberate confusion created by media about the kisses,” Lui Singh further explained, “Those were female mosquitoes who were kissing Rahul Gandhi. But since science textbooks have spread this sexist prejudice about female mosquitoes that only they bite human beings, the kisses were confused as bites.”

“If Rahul baba felt nauseated or feverish, it might be due to other factors, not due to our kisses,” the head of Bundelkhand Mosquito Sangh claimed.

“I mean, Digvijay Singh or something. But not us,” Lui added.

Congress sources tell Faking News that the clarification by the mosquitoes has won Rahul Gandhi’s heart, and he has forgiven them.

“On behalf of Congress, I invite them to join our party. Considering their huge network, I hope they will be very helpful in spreading Congress’ buzz across whole India,” Rahul Gandhi later issued a formal statement.

“We also aim to empower them,” Rahul Gandhi promised.

On cue with Rahul’s response, Bundelkhand’s local Congress workers, who were in state of enmity with the local mosquitoes after the 2008 incident, have invited the mosquitoes for a grand dinner at party office that will empower them by removing their hunger.

“Each of us will donate 20 ml of our blood for the dinner,” promised a Congress member, “If my blood helps the party and Rahul Gandhi ji, I will be the happiest person.”

“This is another jewel in crown of our charismatic leader Rahul Gandhi. Insaanon ko chhodo, hindustan ka machhar machhar Rahul Ji ka deewana hai,” Congress leader Rajeev Shukla expressed his happiness over the development.

Shukla further claimed that the incident proved that there was a huge wave in support of Congress in the country.

“These mosquitoes were part of BJP earlier and had joined the party after Narendra Modi had congratulated them on biting Rahul ji,” Shukla claimed while talking to media, “So this should be seen as thousands of BJP supporters deserting BJP to join Congress.”

Sources say that Congress is planning to use mosquitoes as brand ambassadors and spokespersons too.

“Each mosquito bite should be seen as a kiss – jan jan ko chhua, jan jivan badla,” a Congress leader said. The leader requested the party high command to pass orders for creating environment that promotes mosquitoes’ breeding.

Meanwhile, fumed over Congress-mosquitoes alliance, BJP has vowed to kill all the mosquitoes in all the states ruled by them.

The young and dynamic leader of Congress, Rahul Gandhi, in an effort to revamp the face of the Party, has announced plans to change the party symbol. The earlier open palm will now close its fingers to form a clenched fist.

Rahul claimed that a clenched fist will symbolize his the party’s primary, or even the solitary agenda of empowerment, and help it in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

“A clenched fist symbolizes power, which we want to give to the people of this country. An open palm shows helplessness. I don’t know why it was our party’s symbol for so many years to begin with,” Rahul told Faking News.

The new symbol of Congress.

Dr. Manmohan Singh also extended full support to this decision by nodding. Party leaders say that his closed mouth was an experiment by Rahul Gandhi to check if closed hand was a better idea.

“The closed mouth did wonders in cases of corruption, so Rahul baba became confident and more resolute to get the palm closed,” a party source revealed.

When asked if this major decision was to justify the recent enlightening interview with Arnab Goswami, Rahul denied the allegation, saying he planned to empower even Arnab Goswami with more on-air time on The Newshour.

The decision has started attracting political reactions. RJD, the most loyal ally of Congress, was first to welcome the decision.

“This symbolizes Congress and RJD coming together,” RJD chief Lalu Yadav said, “You need to close your fingers into a fist if you want to milk a cow. Now we are ready to milk the electoral benefits.”

Left parties mocked Congress for using an imagery that is often associated with leftist revolutions, while Mamata Banerjee claimed that Congress was threatening her with such gestures.

BJP claimed that Congress had shown its true colors and it was now close to holding the broom, the election symbol of AAP.

However, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rubbished such comments. He claimed that the change in the symbol symbolized making corruption an integral part of the Congress Party, because a closed hand, according to him, hides whatever is in the hand, which obviously would be money.

For secularism and to get even with the BJP, Kejriwal quickly added that the changed symbol of Congress also proved that Congress and BJP were bhai-bhai.

“Lotus also has closed petals and there is something hidden there,” Kejriwal explained and left the press conference when asked if broom too had something hidden between the straws.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fist-222x300.png,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-planning-to-change-party-symbol-to-fist-to-symbolize-empowerment-4743,Rahul Gandhi planning to change party symbol to fist to symbolize empowerment,,1393408847.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Soon after singing legend Lata Mangeshkar endorsed Narendra Modi for the post of Prime Minister of India, Congress announced a singing talent hunt show “Bharat Ki Bulbul” (BKB) to find a “better” alternative to the now “controversial” singer.

BKB – the first politically sponsored talent hunt show on Indian television – will be aired on DD National.

“We came to know that Lata ji’s voice has polarizing effect, which is obviously not good for the idea of India. India desperately needs a new female icon whose words are music to our ears,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari explained the need for the reality show.

The highly controversial and objectionable moment in Lata Mangeshkar’s career

Sources tell Faking News that Kapil Sibal, a prolific and talented poet, and Daler Mehndi, an acclaimed singer who recently joined Congress, will be the judges of the show. Digvijay Singh, who is a voracious speaker, will be the host.

The auditions will take place in every city of India, with cities going to assembly polls being considered first.

Round one will be a written test, where questions related to the Nehru-Gandhi family history will asked to establish the basic eligibility of the candidate. Next round will consist of Group Discussion and then a Personal Interview with Digvijay Singh and Rahul Gandhi.

“Apart from cash prize, a trophy, and contracts to sing in movies, the winner will also be a star campaigner for Congress, hence these elements are being introduced,” a source revealed.

In the personal interview round, the candidate will be asked to sing songs. Singers will have to sing solo songs followed by duets with religious singers from Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, and couple of relatively unknown religions from Africa. This is to make sure only a secular candidate wins the title of “Bharat Ki Bulbul”.

Sources further reveal that all the shortlisted singers will compulsorily have to sing “Aye mere watan ke logon” and the best singer will be the winner. Later, the song will be released all over the country to erase the memories of Lata Mangeshkar’s voice from the minds of the people.

“The singer who makes Rahul Gandhi ji cry with the rendition of Aye mere watan ke logon will be the new Lata Mangeshkar,” Digvijay Singh confirmed.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/lata_modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-organize-a-singing-reality-show-to-find-alternative-to-lata-mangeshkar-4031,Congress to organize a singing reality show to find alternative to Lata Mangeshkar,,1383387266.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“Raghuram Rajan ji should do a fresh study. Terrorism destroys property and infrastructure, so Bihar must have slipped on the backwardness scale even more,” Nitish said, reacting to media queries about his thoughts on what steps Bihar should take after the serial blasts in Patna.

“Our aim is to get the special status through secular means,” he added, but refused to clarify if he meant that Indian Mujahideen’s acts were “secular”.

Sources tell Faking News that the state government was not taking the situation lightly and was deeply concerned over recent developments, such as an NSSO survey indicating sharpest decline in poverty in Bihar and Planning Commission scrapping Raghuram Rajan’s index that showed Bihar as one of the least developed state.

“Due to terrorism, the quality of life will also go down, apart from destruction to infrastructure, thus adding to overall backwardness,” an official in the state government argued, “Let’s be patient and not give any knee jerk reactions over simple issues like bombs still being found in Gandhi Maidan.”

“Every cloud has a silver lining in every cloud,” the official explained the attitude of the state government towards the serial blasts.

Unreliable sources say that with such arguments, the state government is getting ready to defend itself if the report, which claimed that Patna serial blasts mastermind Tehseen Akhtar was a nephew of a JD(U) leader, was found to be true.

“They will say that it ultimately helped in getting special status for the state,” a source explained.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nitish-kumar.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/terror-attacks-have-made-bihar-more-backward-give-special-status-nitish-kumar-4015,"Terror attacks have made Bihar more backward, give special status: Nitish Kumar",,1383060593.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Facing criticism over attending music launch of a film after bomb blasts in Patna, Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has made public the list of his appointments for the rest of the year.

He has requested all the terror organizations to avoid indulging in terror activities on those particular days when he has a prior appointment such as inaugurating some fashion show or attending birthday parties.

Home Minister in Mumbai after serial blasts in Patna

Earlier, Mr. Shinde was severely criticized by everyone for choosing to attend the music release of Kangna Ranaut’s film Rajjo even after receiving the news of bomb blasts in Bihar.

This is not the first time that Mr. Shinde has received such criticism. In May this year, he was questioned for staying back in the USA even after the deadly Naxal attack on Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh.

Speaking to the journalists while releasing this list, Mr. Shinde said, “See, as a Home minister I do have certain commitments and I must meet them. Do you want a home minister who makes a promise and then doesn’t keep them? I had promised that I will be at this music launch and I was there. Now how was I supposed to know that there will be a terror attack on the same day?”

“I am issuing this list so that terror outfits make note of the days when I am busy and avoid any nefarious activity on those particular days. I am open to working on Sundays. I am willing to work at night too as I displayed after Hyderabad blasts, but please don’t make me cancel my appointments,” Mr. Shinde requested the terrorists.

When this Faking News reporter asked why he is giving a window to terrorists instead of working to ensure there are no terror attacks, Mr. Shinde replied, “See, as Rahul Gandhi ji had said, 99% of the terror attacks can be stopped but 1% will get through. I just want that 1% to happen when I am not occupied in something important.”

After a group of animal lovers declared their support to Rahul Gandhi because the Congress leader loved dogs (ones with four feet), BJP’s Narendra Modi too got support from a group of men who love to wear pink shirts and kurtas.

The BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate was earlier spotted wearing pink waistcoat in Hunkaar Rally here by a volunteer of the group that aims to unite men wanting to wear more pink than is socially acceptable.

Narendra Modi has been spotted wearing pink on earlier occasions too

“Women have appropriated the color pink, and we men have tough time picking this color without being ridiculed as being feminine,” Rohit Raj, one of the activists of “Mardon Wali Gulaabi Gang” told Faking News.

“We were smitten by Narendra Modi wearing pink during the rally. Real men wear pink,” he added, “My vote will go to NaMo for picking pink over usual colors like blue or black.”

Rohit soon updated his views on the Facebook page he manages and he got support from scores of pink loving men who started “liking” and commenting on the post.

“Right man in wrong colored party,” one of the comments read as volunteers declared that they will surely vote for Modi in the coming elections.

There were a few dissenting voices too. One guy named Sanjay Jha declared that he will throw away and burn down his pink chaddi because the color was now associated with a person he can never support. He also unliked the page, sources say.

However, as the “likes” on the post crossed 400, the “Mardon Wali Gulaabi Gang” declared support for Narendra Modi. Some further commented that they also liked the well trimmed white beard of Modi and that was an additional reason for their political support.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sooraj-barjatya-hired-to-write-speeches-around-family-for-rahul-gandhi-3995,"Mumbai. Sooraj Barjatya, the writer of family dramas like Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Hum Saath Saath Hain, and Vivaah, has been hired for writing speeches for Rahul Gandhi after his current speech writers were found to be making a mess of it.

Explaining the rationale behind the decision, Congress spokesperson Rajiv Shukla said, “Rahul Gandhi ji can’t stop talking about the family, and we all too want him to talk about the family. But we need someone who is experienced at writing about family affairs; someone who can make it interesting and not annoying, and that’s when we thought about Sooraj Barjatya ji.”

“As you know Sooraj ji has been making 3-hour films centered around families with almost no story, he should be comfortable writing 30-minutes speech on Gandhi family,” Mr. Shukla expressed confidence.

The speech could come alive like this

When asked whose idea it was to hire Mr. Sooraj, Rajiv Shukla said that it was Rahul Baba himself who came up with the idea.

“Rahul ji said that all his favorite films, including the suspense thriller Hum Aapke Hain Koun, were written by Sooraj Barjatya. Rahul ji relates himself with characters in Barjatya movies where hero has no problem in life getting anything, except the marriage, and has a big family to support him,” claimed Mr. Shukla.

When Faking News contacted Mr. Sooraj Barjatya, he seemed pretty excited to get a chance to work after such a long time with Mr. Rahul Gandhi.

“I thought people no longer liked the kind of stuff I write, but how wrong I was. Rahul’s offer made me believe that whatever happens, family can never go out of fashion,” said Barjatya unable to withhold his khushi ke aansoo.

Giving us some clues on how he plans to add value to Rahul Gandhi’s speeches, the writer-director said that he would ask Rahul to put some glycerin in his eyes while giving speeches as nothing works better than tears when you lack content.

“There will be background score to back the tears,” Mr. Barjatya revealed his plan, “I will suggest Congress to hire a team of Rudalis to cry loudly backstage if Rahul gets too emotional talking about dad or grandma. Songs like Tujhe sab hai pata… Meri maa can also be played during such moments.”

However Mr. Barjatya added that it will not be any cakewalk for him.

“See in all my movies, I have plots around big families having at least 5 chaacha , 6 chaachi, 3 sasur, 4 devar, 6 devraani, 8 jethaani, 15 naukars, 10 drivers, etc. But here I have been strictly told not to mention jeeja Robort Vadra, or even sister Priyanka in the speeches for reasons best known to them,” he explained.

When Faking News contacted Rahul’s Political Guru Mr. Digvijay Singh to ask if appointment of Mr. Barjatya cuts into his territory as a mentor to the youth icon, he answered in negative.

“Sooraj Barjatya might write portions of speeches related to Parivaar, but it’s me who will provide inputs to the portions related to Sangh Parivar. No one can replace me there,” Digvijay Singh said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/we-are-family-movie.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sooraj-barjatya-hired-to-write-speeches-around-family-for-rahul-gandhi-3995,Sooraj Barjatya hired to write speeches around family for Rahul Gandhi,,1382714055.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Unbelievable as it may sound, India is getting ready to attack US and destroy some tapes that were recorded by the NSA while spying on the Indian Prime Minister’s Office.

Happy days are over?

These tapes have vital information about the coal scam, sources say.

However, the government is refusing to accept that coal scam is reason behind the possible military attack. “We are doing it for the sovereignty and respect of our country. How dare they spied on our respected Prime Minister!” said Rahul Gandhi, almost yelling at the reporters.

“We should be ready to fight for the honor. goli, bomb khaayenge, congress, nahi desh, desh ki izzat bachayenge,” Rahul gave a new slogan and walked away after folding his sleeves.

When Faking News asked PMO officials that why Rahul Gandhi, and not the Prime Minister, was addressing the press over such an important issue, the officials refused to comment.

Meanwhile people across the country are almost in a state of shock after realizing that US was their new enemy.

“All these days we were asking for tough action against Pakistan, and we got this! I can’t even recall Sunny Deol beating up some bad American guy,” said a Delhi lad, Vicky.

“Yaar, kabhi Amrika ko us nazar se dekha nahi,” he added, explaining his predicament.

It’s not only the Indians, but rest of the world is also startled by India’s newly found assertiveness and aggression. Pakistan and China are worried if they could be next. However, some experts say that they could take a chill pill as the land they are grabbing doesn’t have any coal mines.

Meanwhile, trying to ease the tension, America has ignored the allegations of tapping Manmohan Singh’s phone. “Why will be tapping his phone? It’s of no use,” said a White House spokesperson.

But sources say that the US has dumped the tapes in Pacific Ocean as they were scared of a full blown war.

“CIA said that Indian Government will go to any extent to destroy the presence of such tape, so it’s better to back off,” revealed our highly placed source in Pentagon.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mms-bo.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/us-gets-coal-scam-info-while-spying-on-pmo-india-may-attack-us-to-destroy-clues-3989,"US gets Coal Scam info while spying on PMO, India may attack US to destroy clues",,1382690188.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Barely a few hours after Rahul Gandhi disclosed the unfortunate incident of 2009, when he was ambushed and barbarically bitten by an army of 25 thousand mosquitoes, Government of India has suspended his security guards who were on duty at that time.

“Rahul Ji never revealed this fact till now as he was afraid that the poor security guards would be fired, so he took a big risk and decided to not tell it to anybody,” said Rahul’s political mentor Digvijay Singh, “But now that we know, we can’t ignore such a dangerous security lapse. Tough steps need to be taken.”

Reportedly, a couple of days earlier, while he was in Rajasthan, he saw a mosquito roaming around him. He immediately recognized it as it was the same one that was leading the group of 25000 mosquitoes back in 2009. A terrified Rahul couldn’t sleep the whole night.

“ek bhi machchhar khatarnaak hai”

Next day, at a rally in Churu, he finally revealed that his life was in danger, but didn’t disclose the reason. However, he couldn’t keep the secret with him for long and today he claimed how these flying monsters were after his life.

The revelations by the young Gandhi has left everyone in the party and the government jittery. In a hurriedly called meeting by the Home Minister, the security guards were held responsible for this serious breach in security.

But the security guards have refused denied that any laxity on duty. “We have never left Rahul baba alone and we can’t recall any such incident. Maybe the mosquitoes bit him when he went near a bush to take a leak. We can’t really accompany him to those places,” claimed Sanjay Jha (name changed), the suspended security guard who was on duty when mosquitoes attacked Rahul.

Apart from suspending the guards, the central government has issued a high alert in all areas where Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to visit for rallies. Special mosquito killer teams have been deployed at those places.

“Senior bureaucrats, who have become expert at killing flies in office, are personally leading and training such teams,” a government source told Faking News.

The source further revealed that Rahul’s security has been enhanced from Z+ to Z-Mortein-Plus. He will be surrounded by a team of 36 guards, who will be carrying and spraying mosquito repellents twice per hour. When he will be out of his car, he will always be under a big mosquito net.

“If the mosquitoes fly too high, we will take help of Air Force,” informed Home Minister Shushil Kumar Shinde, explaining the gravity of the situation.

Meanwhile, a senior BJP leader mocked Rahul’s drama and claimed that mosquitoes were present even during Narendra Modi’s rallies, but not a single mosquito survives when people start clapping.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rahul-gandhi-churu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-suspends-rahul-gandhis-security-guards-for-failing-to-kill-mosquitoes-3987,Government suspends Rahul Gandhi's security guards for failing to kill mosquitoes,,1382618212.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-takes-revenge-calls-rahul-gandhis-emotional-speech-a-complete-nonsense-3981,"Beijing, China. Given that Manmohan Singh has just a few months left in the current term and the next term appears uncertain, he has made up his mind to liberate himself from the puppet strings.

Soon after Rahul Gandhi finished his emotional speech in Rajasthan yesterday, an unusually angry Manmohan Singh, who is currently on a diplomatic visit to China, called a press meet in Beijing. Ridiculing the Nehru-Gandhi scion, MMS slammed Rahul Gandhi for his emotionally dramatic speech in a politically charged rally.

A rare photo showing Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi in conversation

He termed it a “complete nonsense”.

“I will tell you what is my opinion on Rahul’s speech. And my opinion is – it is complete nonsense. He should be taped over his mouth and locked in Congress office. This is my personal opinion and party should think about it if it wants to win the elections,” said Dr. Singh, venting out his long suppressed anger.

Faking News expected that the Prime Minister could stand up and walk out as Rahul Gandhi had done when he called the ordinance nonsense, but Dr. Singh stayed back to issue more statements.

“In one speech he talks about his mother, in next about his grandmother, next he will talk about Nehru, then about his forefathers, and by the end of the campaign he will talk about prehistoric human beings. What the hell is this? Are we planning to win an election by time traveling?” he wondered.

“Aise hazaaron bakwaas bhashan se achchi hai meri khamoshi, na jaane kitne raalies ki aabru rakhkhi,” the Prime Minister added.

Political analysts say that with this daring act, Manmohan has tried to kill two birds with one stone. First, he took revenge for the humiliation unleashed by Rahul over the ordinance, and second, he passed a strong message to his Chinese counterpart to not take him lightly.

Sources in PMO revealed that Manmohan Singh even sent a video clip of his outbursts to US President Barack Obama, because he was in US when Rahul Gandhi came up with the anti-ordinance outburst.

Interestingly, White House sources confirmed the receipt of the clip even before the Prime Minister sent it. This has given rise to speculations if Obama is spying on Dr. Singh’s phone, but PMO sources rejected such speculations.

Back home, Manmohan Singh is getting a lot of applause for the first time since the 1991 reforms, but Rahul Gandhi is in a state of shock. He is reported to have immediately called up his mother and asked her to order Manmohan Singh to attend his next three speeches without using any earplugs.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RahulGandhiManmohanSingh.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-takes-revenge-calls-rahul-gandhis-emotional-speech-a-complete-nonsense-3981,"Manmohan Singh takes revenge, calls Rahul Gandhi’s “emotional” speech a “complete nonsense”",,1382605804.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mallika-sherawat-to-select-delhi-cm-candidate-for-bjp-through-a-reality-show-3954,"New Delhi. Thoroughly confused whom to announce their Chief Ministerial candidate for the Delhi assembly elections, BJP has now turned to Mallika Sherawat for help.

Elections in Delhi are due on 4th of December and BJP has failed to put forward their CM candidate till now, although they announced a PM candidate even though no one knows the exact dates of the next general elections.

While Vijay Goel was largely expected to lead the campaign for BJP, the name of Harshvardhan has also cropped up in recent days. Several party members have also asked for a new face to counter Sheila Dixit and Arvind Kejriwal.

Mallika laughed many times during the interview, even when this reporter asked about BJP’s preparedness for the assembly elections.

Explaining the rationale behind seeking Mallika’s help, Mr. Gadkari said, “She is gaining valuable experience of selecting a winner out of so many losers on the set of Bachelorette India; this will come in handy as our task is hardly any different.”

“She has had super success with triangular love stories like Murder and we have a triangular love story, sorry, triangular contest in Delhi this time around,” he added.

Insisting that no one knew Delhi better than Mallika, Gadkari further said, “She has even done a film with Delhi in the title (Kismat Love Paisa Delhi), and she’d from neighboring Haryana. I think she knows the pulse of Delhi.”

Mallika Sherawat, who is currently busy selecting a match for herself on the show “The Bachelorette India – Mere Khayalon ki Mallika“, will take a few days off from the show to help out Mr. Gadkari.

Speaking to Faking News, Mallika said, “Yes, I am going to select the BJP CM candidate for Delhi. I can’t refuse to help out a fellow party member of Modi ji. As you know I really love and respect Modi ji. I even sang a very nice birthday song for Modi ji’s birthday, wait I will sing it again for you.”

At this point we hurriedly interrupted her before she could start singing and asked her whether this could mean that her reality show could briefly go off air. She said that her producers had provisioned for this.

“We are planning to use some clips from Rakhi Ka Swayamvar, where Rakhi Sawant will not be visible. No one will be able to tell a difference as hardly anyone watches the show for the contestants,” a member of the production team said.

“It is like using some clips of Narendra Modi’s speech from earlier rallies and claiming they were from a newer rally. No one will complain and notice,” the crew member tried to explain.

As per sources, Mallika is planning several tests to check the ability of the leaders aspiring to be the CM of Delhi. A close aide of Mallika told us, “First Mallika ji will check their looks and see who has greater charisma. Shortlisted candidates will watch all of Mallika’s films with her so that we can test their patience, a very important characteristic for a politician.”

Meanwhile, when asked if she will help out Congress and select their PM candidate, Mallika replied “Oh no, Congress already has a queen, they don’t need this Mallika to make a decision.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The_Bachelorette_India_-_Mere_Khayalon_ki_Mallika.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mallika-sherawat-to-select-delhi-cm-candidate-for-bjp-through-a-reality-show-3954,Mallika Sherawat to select Delhi CM candidate for BJP through a reality show,,1382274653.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-hand-to-replace-red-lights-at-traffic-signals-3952,"Mumbai. Traffic police here has announced that the Congress’ election symbol will henceforth replace the red stop signs at traffic signals across the city. This measure has been adopted to bring order to the traffic situation in the city, where most drivers have taken to breaking red lights on a regular basis.

Faking News interviewed Manohar Murli, a senior official from the traffic department, in order to understand the logic behind this step.

The new symbol

“If this hand can stop the progress of an entire nation, we feel that it can stop anything,” explained Murli as he waved a card board Congress hand enthusiastically in the air.

This new measure seems to be working. It has been observed that all alike, including auto-rickshaws, drunken truck drivers and even Salman Khan’s Audi come to a screeching halt when they see the formidable Congress Symbol flashing at them at traffic lights.

However, many are not happy about this development.

Badrinivas, a local traffic police official, used to draw 3 times his salary by writing fake challans to speeding drivers. Now that business has dried up, he has decided to migrate to Gujarat, which he hears is now the only place in the country where things can still move fast.

Given the success of this measure, there are talks to implement it on a national scale. However, the Home Ministry is currently hard pressed to find a proper place for the Congress symbol in rural areas, where there are almost no roads or toilets.

According to Chaman Kumar, a small farmer from the Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh, there are better places for this symbol. He has used a magnified cardboard version of the Congress hand in place of scarecrows in his farms.

This has really solved the problem of pestilence; rats have completed disappeared from all lands with the Congress stronghold. This is not surprising as rats are often the first to leave a sinking ship.

Unfortunately, Chaman was forced to take the symbol down after a few weeks when he observed that anything in its shadow stopped growing.

This has affected his crops negatively but he is not too worried because of the Food Security Bill. “Perhaps they knew,” Chaman told Faking News, “that with the way things are going, very soon people would not have anything to eat, and hence they introduced the Food Security Bill.”

Now, Chaman uses the mid-day meal his daughter gets packed from her government school every day to control pestilence.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/congress1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-hand-to-replace-red-lights-at-traffic-signals-3952,Congress hand to replace red lights at traffic signals,,1382270783.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/removing-saffron-from-the-tricolor-suggested-for-communal-harmony-3944,"Bangalore. The Government of Karnataka has decided to step up its “desaffronization” efforts that are aimed at ensuring communal harmony by removing too much of saffron – a controversial color – from public life.

Following a report published in one of rival publications of Faking News, this correspondent did an extensive research and found out the details of what the government had been planning and doing.

Investigations reveal that the state government has given the desaffronization activity the highest priority, over and above trivial issues such as fixing roads, cleaning garbage, and improving civic supplies.

Earlier, a Bharat Nirman ad on Sadbhav (harmony) had suggested something similar.

To achieve this, a three-member committee has been formed. Sources say that among the recommendations of the committee, the most important one is to remove the saffron color from the national flag.

“The saffron color gives a wrong idea of India. And as we all know, we have to unite and make every effort to save the idea of India. Removing the controversial color will be a huge boost to this mission,” a government source claimed.

Sources reveal that as a replacement of Saffron, Orange is being considered, as was suggested by a television journalist on Twitter. The journalist’s suggestion has echoed with state’s intellectuals such as veteran writer UR Ananthamurthy.

When this reporter wondered if changing the tricolor will not be a violation of the national flag code, Chief Minister Siddharamaiya said, “Government of India has already started experimenting with the idea as shown by Kapil Sibalji and Chidambaramji. I’m sure Prime Minister Manmohan Gandhiji will support our efforts.”

The Committee for Resisting Saffronization also found serious objectionable content in school textbooks of Karnataka. This includes mention of Swami Vivekananda (a Hindu supremacist) and his quotes, which could “radicalize” young minds.

The committee recommends Vivekananada’s name being omitted from every textbook in the state. The committee feels Indian history can easily be written without mentioning Vivekananda as historian Ramchandra Guha has done in his book “Makers of Modern India”.

“The quotes by Vivekananda are too complex and it will hamper the mental development of children. It will reduce their ability to stand the day-to-day statements made by the modern political leadership,” a committee member explained the dangers of Vivekananda.

Among other instances of saffronization, the committee found too many “conspicuous communal constructions” in cities like Hampi, some of which have already been demolished. The committee has recommended removing whatever was remaining of these.

When Faking News tried to get reactions from the opposition over government’s deeds, we were told that HD Deve Gowda was asleep and hence we’d have to wait till he wakes up (to the reality). The leader of the BJP could also not be contacted as we were told that he had locked himself up the toilet for some unknown reason.

Impressed with Swami Sobhan Sarkar’s supernatural ability to sense the presence of hidden treasures, Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi has decided to hire him to help her son Rahul discover his hidden talents.

Swami Sobhan has miraculous power to establish a hotline connection in his dreams with the almighty, who guides him with directions to find valuable assets present in the vicinity.

Finding it tough to control his happiness.

Sources close to the party reveal that it was Rahul Gandhi’s political guru Digvijay Singh who first suggested Swami Sobhan’s name to Sonia Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi will now stay for near about a month at Swami Ji’s ashram to undergo talent hunt sessions.

“It’s an undeniable fact that Rahul Ji is a talent mine. Fortunately he is still young so even if we discover the talent now, he has enough time to put them to use,” said Digvijay Singh, who was present at Swami Ji’s ashram to review accommodation arrangements for Rahul.

“I hope they will bond well, as they share their love for dreams,” he further said.

A close aide of Swami Ji disclosed that before agreeing to help Rahul, Swami ji paid him a visit to analyze the feasibility of talent excavation.

“He put his hand over Rahul’s head and closed his eyes. For a few seconds everything was still, but all of a sudden Swami Ji received something like an electric shock and was thrown five meters across the room,” the aide told Faking News, “Swami Ji was amazed by such a high density of talent, and he instantaneously accepted the offer.”

Talking to media, Swami Sobhan said that he was quite confident about the talent mining in Rahul’s brain and hoped that by the end of one month, India will certainly get her own Leonardo da Vinci.

“Very soon Rahul will be expert of Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy and almost every thinkable topic. He will dance like Michael Jackson, act like Al Pacino, fly like Superman, and shout like Sunny Deol,” Swami Ji claimed.

It was torn, thrown out, and bleeding, but the doctors could piece it together after some men took it to the hospital.

Regaining its consciousness, the ordinance jotted down its feelings on a page of diary, which Faking News could access from its sources. Take a read:

That fateful moment when the poor ordinance was given a lethal blow

“Humein to apno ne loota, ghairo me kahaan dam tha. meri kashti doobi thi wahaan, jahaan pani kam tha.”

Feeling betrayed and backstabbed. Never ever imagined that my own parents would try to kill me. Doctors and police say it was a case of attempted honor killing.

Most probably they are right. After the public outrage, looks like my parents were feeling too ashamed of me. But don’t know – if this was the fate I was supposed to meet, why did they conceive me and gave birth to me in first place?

I still remember by birthday; there was a grand party. Party and the allies were so happy. Jubilations were all around. After all, I was their savior from the Supreme Court order of disqualifying convicted legislators.

Many were treating me as avatar of Krishna who would save them from this Supreme Kans. Excited Laloo uncle had declared me as his 10th child and promised me to give 10 buffaloes and lifetime free supply of fodder for them.

Even guys from the opposition and other parties came to the birthday party and put black tika on me. kahin nazar na lag jaaye, lekin lag hi gayi.

I was branded a monster even before I took my first steps from the PMO to the President’s House. Common man started seeing me as a villain who was sent by Tamraj Kilvish to destroy the Indian democracy.

Pressure started to build on my parents to say Sorry Shaktimaan publicly, and all of a sudden I became a liability. I didn’t know that instead of saying Sorry Shaktimaan, Rahul bhaiyya will become Shaktimaan himself.

He appeared out of nowhere, just like Shaktimaan would appear out of thin air, and called me “complete nonsense”.

I felt so bad. Almost felt like Manmohan Singh. I felt worse.

Suddenly Rahul bhaiyya picked me up, tore me, and threw me out. I cried for help, but no one came forward; all of them were busy discussing this Shaktimaan act on TV channels or cracking jokes on Twitter. There, my bones were cracking.

I was orphaned. But thanks to some people who mistook me for the torn Jan Lokpal Bill, I was taken to the hospital, where the doctors saved my life.

I feel betrayed, but I am an optimist. I know all of them need me. One day or later they will come to the hospital to pick me up.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-named-second-most-honest-city-while-sharad-pawar-was-not-in-the-city-3821,"Mumbai. Readers’ Digest magazine conducted an experiment and found that Mumbai was the second most honest city in the world. Now it has come to light that Sharad Pawar, one of the well known residents of the city residing at Malabar Hill, was not in the city when this experiment was conducted.

This has led to people finding a relationship between the two events.

“Thank god he was not here, else we would have ended at the bottom of the list,” claimed Sanjay Raut, a Shiv Sena leader, “My sources say he was holidaying in New York and that’s why that city fared poorly than Mumbai.”

Raut then went on to attack Shah Rukh Khan, claiming that Mumbai would also fare better at pollution levels if the smoking Khan left the city, however, we requested him to stick to Sharad Pawar.

On the other hand, Sharad Pawar has claimed that Mumbai missed being on the top of the list because he was not in the city. His claim was backed by Congress ahead of the next general elections.

Sharad Pawar ruing the missed chance

“The average honesty would have shot up if I were in the city. I will try to be there when next experiment takes place and collect all the wallets,” Pawar told Faking News.

The experiment, which involved dropping 12 wallets containing 3000 bucks at various locations, saw an average Mumbaikar returning 9 out of those 12 wallets.

While the optimists hailed the spirit of Mumbai for this honesty, the pessimists had different ideas.

“Those 9 must have mistaken the wallets as some strategically placed bombs on roads and informed the police,” claimed one person with no Mumbai spirit.

“Or maybe they thought 3000 rupees were nothing as it couldn’t have helped them buy even some onions,” he added.

While the pessimist views were rejected by most commentators, some found merit in them.

“It’s clear that Inflation is giving rise to honesty. That’s why our government fares better on social indicators,” claimed an expert.

“The 3 who didn’t return the wallets must have been outsiders,” claimed MNS chief Raj Thackeray.

Meanwhile residents of Delhi are planning to protest outside the office of Readers’ Digest magazine for not including Delhi in the experiment.

“They should conduct the experiment when Parliament is not in process, and put at least 15000 rupees in the wallet,” demanded Robert, a Delhi resident.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pawar.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mumbai-named-second-most-honest-city-while-sharad-pawar-was-not-in-the-city-3821,Mumbai named second most honest city while Sharad Pawar was not in the city,,1380198337.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-to-start-a-detective-agency-cid-3813,"Bhopal. Sensing his actual field of interest, veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh has opened a detective agency named CID – Chief Inspector Digvijay.

CID is also the name of a popular TV show where a team led by ACP Pradyuman solves all cases. Now Digvijay Singh led CID is all set to break that record.

Digvijay Singh with an RSS hand – the eternal evidence

“Without getting any darwaaza broken by Inspector Daya or any scientific analysis by Doctor Salunkhe, Digvijay Singh ji will be solving cases,” a close aide of the former CM of Madhya Pradesh told Faking News.

“Digvijay Singh is god gifted with unique sniffing capability to detect conspiracies and secrets,” the aide added, “That’s why he’s making the most out of it. If his strategy doesn’t help the party win elections, at least it will help him earn some detective fees.”

Unlike normal investigation, where a detective reaches to conclusion after observing events and collecting evidences, Digvijay Singh will start with the conclusion and then proceed to generate evidence and create events.

“Frankly it’s not a unique approach. Most of the social research and analysis, as opposed to scientific research and analysis, takes the same route, but Digvijay Singh has taken it to a new level,” an expert said.

The expert pointed out to the latest development where team members of Digvijay Singh asked a shopkeeper to come up with a quote for burqas, and later that quote was presented as a bill credited to BJP.

“That’s how evidences are gathered to solve a case,” the expert explained.

Recently, Digvijay rose to fame among intellectuals after he published his much talked about research paper in International Journal of Applied Logic. In his research paper “RSS – The Ultimate Cause”, using his razor sharp logic he literally proved RSS as reason behind almost everything in universe, from Big Bang to killing of a mosquito. This inspired him to aim higher and he decided to become a professional detective.

When asked if he will also investigate cases like missing files related to the coal allocation scam, Digvijay Singh said that CBI was doing a job as good as him and his services were not needed there.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/digvijay_singh.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-to-start-a-detective-agency-cid-3813,Digvijay Singh to start a detective agency CID,,1380107115.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/super-supreme-court-announced-to-delay-cases-against-politicians-forever-3811,"New Delhi. After clearing an ordinance that saved an MP/MLA from losing his parliamentary/assembly seat even if convicted in a criminal case by a lower court, the union cabinet has now cleared an ordinance that will create some extra levels of courts above the Supreme Court.

This will allow a convicted politician to keep on appealing against the conviction in higher courts, and thus delay the case against him or her forever.

No longer supreme?

“A back of the envelop calculation shows that if we add a few extra levels of hierarchy in the judicial system, a convicted politician will die his natural death before the highest court of the country pronounces a final verdict on him,” a government source explained.

“This assuming that the crime was done in the juvenile age,” the source further explained, “And even if he lives too long, we can always have review petitions or we can add a couple of levels more in the judiciary.”

As part of this ordinance, a “Super Supreme Court” will be established immediately through an act of the Parliament.

“Every level added above the existing Supreme Court will take cases only against elected representatives,” the source told Faking News, “Rest of the India will have to agree on the final authority of the Supreme Court. This is in line with special privileges extended to the elected representatives.”

“We could make a few exceptions, e.g. the Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute case could be transferred to the Super Supreme Court and beyond,” the source said.

Apart from “Super Supreme Court”, other levels of courts planned are “Awesome Court”, “Epic Court”, and “God Level Court”.

The decision by the government has been met with public and media outrage, but there were some voices in support too.

“Why are we so much against the criminals? Robinhood was also a criminal, but he was the first one to implement Direct Cash Transfer scheme. Let’s not be prejudiced against criminals, because they are not necessarily communal,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh extended his support to the ordinance.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/supreme_court_of_india.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/super-supreme-court-announced-to-delay-cases-against-politicians-forever-3811,Super Supreme Court announced to delay cases against politicians forever,,1380094713.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With disproportionate assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav being dropped and Jagan Reddy getting bail in a similar case, UPA government has decided to give relief to everyone facing allegations of having disproportionate assets.

For the same, the government is planning to bring “Disproportionate Assets Security Bill” that will take away worries of all those who have amassed wealth in excess of their known sources of income.

The Finance Minister did a ‘balle balle’ dance to signal beginning of good times

“People have to lie and commit fraud to hide their disproportionate assets. If we legalize their assets, there will be no fraud,” Finance Minister P Chidambaram said, drawing instant approval from BSP chief Mayawati and RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav.

The bill proposes that owners of the disproportionate assets are given immunity from legal action. All they need to pay is a token amount of property and wealth tax and they are done.

Throwing light on some other positive impacts of the new bill, a senior legal analyst explained, “Since a lot of people have undeclared assets, it will save a lot of time of the judiciary if the bill is implemented.”

“It will also bring back the black money stashed in foreign banks,” the analyst told Faking News.

The bill has been welcomed by all political parties. Even a fierce opponent like Baba Ramdev has welcomed it.

“It is like a loan waiver for small farmers,” Robert Vadra too welcomed the provisions of the bill.

Even the CBI is happy with the move as they will not need to file new cases or drop old cases randomly.

The only people unhappy with the bill are a few income tax officers and custom officials who fear that their own source of building disproportionate assets could dry up as a result.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chidu.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-to-bring-disproportionate-assets-security-bill-to-win-allies-and-voters-3805,UPA to bring Disproportionate Assets Security Bill to win allies and voters,,1380015060.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a major blow to every political party and leader, a local man here has forgotten his caste and religion. The man in his mid 40’s is now an “undecided voter” as per the latest opinion poll.

“He was perfectly normal till yesterday, blaming people from other religions and castes for inflation and mosquitoes in his room, but this morning he was talking about economics and hygiene!” Kabir Chand, neighbor of the concerned man told Faking News.

The man has even forgotten his name, which had clues to the religion and caste he earlier belonged to. “For the time being, we are calling him X-Man,” Kabir said.

When an EVM was placed before X-Man, he thought it was coffee vending machine and accordingly pressed the button, leaving everyone in shock.

“I am finding it quite tough to enjoy the political news and debates. I also feel out of place when I log onto social media,” said X-Man explaining the complexity of his situation.

X-Man tried to get some conversation going with “normal” men in his colony, and in the end all he could gather was that a man’s the political support must derive from his religion and caste.

“Now I have no fucking clue whom should I vote for and support,” he rued.

While some experts have hailed the development and claimed that India needed an army of X-Men, many other experts, especially pollsters and election analysts, have termed the development “catastrophic”.

“It will be almost impossible to predict which party will win the elections if such voters are in majority. We will go out of business,” Yogender Yadav, a leading psephologist expressed his deepest fears.

Although he has forgotten his religion too, some experts have refused to declare X-Man “secular”.

“If he doesn’t have a strong feeling of identity based on caste, we can’t treat him as secular,” Lalu Kumar, a sociologist claimed.

Meanwhile political parties are trying their best to make sure this “disease” doesn’t spread to other people.

“While this is unfortunate, we are looking at the positive side. He is like a blank DVD; we can write whatever we want. Make him Dalit, Brahmin, Muslim or anything.

He is hardly available to media to take questions, it’s a dream to get his interview, but Faking News got this dream opportunity.

Our reporter dozed off while thinking of ideas, and he saw a dream where he was interviewing Rahul Gandhi. Here are highlights of that dream i.e. interview:

Rahul Gandhi using his magical powers to help a person sleep and see dreams

Faking News (FN): First question, how did you appear in my dreams? Rahul Gandhi (RG) : you must be a very poor person. Poor people love me and they see me in dreams.

FN: You are right. I’m a poor person. Not a good salary. Will you pay me if I write good things about you? RG: No. because if I pay you, you will no longer be poor. I want poor people to dream. Their dreams should be the biggest.

FN: Like a poor chaiwala dreaming that he will become Prime Minister of India one day? Do you support such dreams? RG: Next question.

FN: What do you think about Kashmir problem, how can we solve it? RG: First of all, that’s not a problem. Pakistan is a poor country and they have every right to dream big and they are doing it. Let Pakistan dream about Kashmir. We will reply with a bigger dream, say Congress sweeping elections in Pakistan.

FN: Why have you become so obsessed with dreams of late? What started this tryst with dreams? RG: It was Rajiv Gandhi ji’s dream that everyone should have a dream; and I will help, especially the poor, with dreams.

FN: In your recent rally, you cited physical illness as reason for poverty which is quite a drastic shift from your earlier, ‘poverty is a state of mind’ theory. RG: My speeches are well researched, but are always in a beta version. I am evolving as a human being, so obviously opinions keep on changing. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity could be contradicted tomorrow. Each day I rediscover myself, my dreams, and my speeches.

FN: The craziest thing you have ever done in life? RG: I went to a poor man’s house and didn’t eat anything.

FN: When did you do that!? RG: In my dream!

FN: Ok, why are you not getting married? RG: That’s a wrong way of asking. More appropriate way of asking the same question would be, “What about your dream girl?”

FN: Ok! So what about you dream girl? RG: I am already married to my dreams. Mere khawaab hi meri dulhan hai.

FN: Rahul Ji, thank you for such an insightful interview. RG: You’re Welcome, Tata, Good Night, Sweet Dreams.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rahul-gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dream-interview-with-rahul-gandhi-3765,Dream interview with Rahul Gandhi,,1379506512.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/obsessed-modi-fan-caught-writing-namo4pm-on-his-office-walls-3733,"Gurgaon. A 33-year-old diehard Narendra Modi fan, Keshav was today caught red-handed by the housekeeping department of his office when he was busy scribbling praises about the Gujarat Chief Minister on all the walls of his office under the pretext of doing “overtime”.

Keshav’s colleagues confirm though his behavior had always been odd but he went totally berserk after “sources” told him that Modi could soon be officially declared BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate.

“He would go mad and start abusing anyone who differed from his views on Modi,” one of the colleagues claimed.

Keshav was previously reprimanded by his boss when it came to his notice that he had written #NaMo4PM on all the notices company had put in the notice board.

Keshav wrote this when his wife asked him to write a cheque to pay for the house rent

He was finally given a suspension warning when he ended an official presentation with a collage of Narendra Modi and his (Modi’s) achievements on the last powerpoint slide in front of foreign clients.

He would take sick leaves to watch any event Modi would be part of as if it were a cricket match. Sources say he had also read all 56,800,800 links that Google came up with when searched for Narendra Modi.

He also demanded HR of his company to screen the BJP parliamentary board meet to be held on 13th September LIVE on a big screen if they didn’t want him to take leave.

Sources say his eccentric behavior was not just limited to office. He was on earlier occasion caught several times professing his love for Modi, by writing #NaMoStorm and #WeSupportNaMo where ever he could, such as walls of the lane where he stays, feedback forms at restaurants, credit card slips, etc.

“Last month Chintu, his son got just 10 numbers in maths paper, Keshav punished him by asking him to write #NaMo4PM thousand times on a paper and then went ahead to write the same in the remark column of his report card after signing it,” Keshav’s wife shared her frustration.

Keshav was no different in the virtual world. Since last couple of months, anything that he tweeted had #NaMo4PM and #NaMorocks as the default hashtags. Even his “Good morning” tweets and replies to any tweet or status on Facebook were appended with #Vote4NaMo.

“We know Narendra bhai has lot of genuine supporters and fans, but I would ask them to go slow and not go overboard,” requested BJP president Rajnath Singh when a delegation of Keshav-persecuted people met him.

Meanwhile a similar diehard fan of Rahul Gandhi was first reprimanded but later forgiven by Congress leaders after he was found writing #Pappu4PM and #PappuRocks in girl’s toilet of his office in his bid to promote Gandhi scion.

“We could not risk losing him. He belongs to highly endangered species you see,” confirmed a Congress leader on condition of anonymity.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/namo4pm.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/obsessed-modi-fan-caught-writing-namo4pm-on-his-office-walls-3733,Obsessed Modi fan caught writing #NaMo4PM on his office walls,,1379085361.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advani-agrees-on-modi-after-bjp-partners-with-google-for-lal-krishna-android-3711,"New Delhi. A compromise formula has been reached within BJP over the issue of leadership of Narendra Modi. Sources tell Faking News that LK Advani has finally rested his case and agreed on Modi’s name as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the party.

This breakthrough was achieved after BJP convinced Google to name its next version of Android as Lal Krishna Android (LKA). Google’s decision came after BJP leaders sent a mercy-petition-cum-business-proposal to the internet giant for co-branding.

In a joint press conference with Google’s CEO Larry Page, Rajnath Singh said, “You must have seen roads, airports, grounds, government plans, etc. being named after former PMs, but this is first time in human history that such a widely used high end technical product is being named after a former deputy PM. Even the US president has never achieved such an honor.”

Lal Krishna Android – powering conversations

“Getting Android named after you is as good as being the Prime Minister of India. In fact, it’s much better. International name and fame that it will bring to Advani Ji will make his name immortal. BJP is thankful to Larry Ji for accepting our proposal,” the BJP president further said.

“Advani Ji is happy,” he added.

The exclusive features of Lal Krishna Android are not known, though rumors and leaks are already taking place through “sources”. One such rumor says that this version of Android could make even old phones appear young.

While he refused to divulge the tech specifications, Larry Page revealed the reason behind the business decision, “For many months, we have been getting petitions to name Android version after some Indian sweets. As current version is Kit-Kat, next version has to start with ‘L’, and we had few options like Laddoo and Lassi, but no sponsorship money there. Fortunately, BJP came up with something that made business sense.”

When asked what was so “sweet” about LK Advani, Larry said, “When an 85-year-old person loves a post like a 5-year-old loves chocolate, you can only say ‘so sweet!’ and that’s what we said when we got the proposal.”

“It is also ‘so sweet’ to see the same people, who had earlier blamed Advani Ji for 1992 riots, now finding him moderate and inclusive,” Rajnath Singh took the mike from the Google CEO to explain the “sweetness” around LK Advani.

The decision by Google has shocked Congress and Cadbury. Cadbury was planning to launch a chocolate brand starting with letter ‘L’ to become the branding partner for Android 4.5, while Congress fears that the social media will become even more anti-Congress with BJP being the partner of Android.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lka.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advani-agrees-on-modi-after-bjp-partners-with-google-for-lal-krishna-android-3711,Advani agrees on Modi after BJP partners with Google for Lal Krishna Android,,1378976418.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Rahul Gandhi decided to abandon his own dreams and adopt the dreams of the poor, dalit, and the adivasis, a poor man here decided to return the favor and adopt Rahul Gandhi’s abandoned dream.

Chhotu Bhima, who attended Rahul Gandhi’s rally found the crumpled dream of the Congress Vice President after the rally. The dream, which looked like a wig, was lying on the ground. Chhotu could recognize it as it was golden in color and its surface showed visuals of millions of people clapping.

Meanwhile Rahul Gandhi is reported to have tried the dream of one poor man and he was still sleeping when reports last came in

“It was clearly Rahul Gandhi’s dream to have millions attend his rally and clap with awe after every statement issued by him,” Chhotu told Faking News.

Convinced that it was the dream abandoned by Rahul Gandhi, Chhotu picked up that wig-like thing and went back home. He immediately slept off to see the dreams of Rahul Gandhi.

Just after fifteen minutes of sleep, Chhotu woke up laughing like crazy. Last time he had laughed so hard was when he was diagnosed with a virus called SidhhuPuranSingh. Faking News waited for him to stop laughing, which took an hour, after which Chhotu recounted his experience.

“For a change I had a colorful dream, else all my earlier dreams were in black and white,” Chhotu started on a somber note, “I also saw myself eating pizza while getting a haircut in Honolulu, and boy, the Prime Minister brought me the cheesy dip!”

“Suddenly, the mirror in the hair cutting salon started showing a cartoon movie and the barber started singing ‘golmaal hai bhai sab golmaal hai’ – I couldn’t understand what was happening,” he recalled.

“I knew it was a song from the movie Golmaal, but somehow I, dreaming as Rahul Gandhi, started lungi dance on the song,” Chhotu had a big grin on his face, and he started laughing again recounting his dream, “And once I started lungi dance, suddenly everyone else in the salon started dancing with me, and they included Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot, and some other people I see on TV regularly.”

“The only person not dancing was the barber, who suddenly switched off the music, pushed me into the chair, and tonsured my head completely. I was looking so funny when I went bald!” Chhotu described his most absurd dream till date, “And that is when I wore this wig and my dream ended.”

Faking News consulted a dream interpreter to find out what exactly Chhotu saw and experienced.

“The part about haircut and PM bringing cheesy dip is self-explanatory, and so is the Golmaal song and everyone dancing with Chhotu, I mean Rahul,” Nindiya Sharma, the dream interpreter said, “Rahul Gandhi losing all his hair means inclusive growth, or lack of it, where every strand of hair is of the same length, and the wig is the Right to Hair bill that comes after inclusive hair-fall.”

“No idea about lungi dance,” Nindiya said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rahulg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/poor-man-finds-rahul-gandhis-dreams-wakes-up-laughing-3705,"Poor man finds Rahul Gandhi’s dreams, wakes up laughing",,1378897827.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/govt-to-ban-social-media-to-bring-it-back-as-right-to-social-media-bill-3690,"New Delhi. After reports that social media is used to spread rumors that eventually cause people to kill each other, the government of India has decided to ban social media.

India would join its neighbor Pakistan in taking such a step. Pakistan had banned social media to protect religious feelings, while India will do it for much more – to protect religious people, to secure internal security, to curb hate speech, to increase productivity, and to control floods and famines.

Kapil Sibal signaled his grand victory over internet after the announcement

“Leading journalists, eminent citizens, and other random individuals agree that social media is a nuisance to development and harmony, hence we have decided to ban social media,” Telecom Minster and one of the earliest critic of social media, Kapil Sibal said.

The announcement was expectedly met with huge outrage on social media with millions of tweets and Facebook updates published to protest against the decision, but the government is firm.

“Do whatever you want, but your Twitter, Facebook, and even Google Plus accounts will be unavailable after midnight,” Sibal explained.

Sources tell Faking News that it’s a well calculated plan by the Congress party even though it knew that the decision will be opposed by the majority of people with a broadband connection and bulging belly.

“They will keep the ban for around six months, and by then Indians will have lost all the steam and would have resigned to their fate,” an expert predicted, “After six months, Sonia Gandhi will express her unhappiness and the NAC (National Advisory Council) will draft a Right to Social Media bill.”

The expert, who didn’t want to be quoted as he could be branded a fascist and stripped of his reputation as political expert, further claimed that this was in line with the rights-based approach of the Congress party.

“First they deprive you of those rights – be it information, food, or education – for decades, and when you take that deprivation as your tryst with destiny, you are given those basic rights through legislation. Since things move faster online, decades will be just a few months,” the expert claimed.

In a major blow to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, an FIR has been filed against him by some activists for issuing a statement that had absolutely no political connotation.

“Teachers teach in schools” Modi said in a function organized by Faking News on the eve of Teachers’ Day. The statement left thousands (though some sources claim the number to be running into millions) of political pundits and experts devastated.

Did Narendra Modi troll others by issuing that disappointing statement?

“Why is he issuing statements like Chidambaram – rupee will find its value based on supply and demand and other such textbookish stuff?” complained a political analyst who was waiting to write an editorial on whatever Modi says.

“WTF! This is not what we expect from him!” rued another analyst who had skipped his lunch to write a critical piece on Modi’s politics, body language, and vocal cords.

While the statement came as a major disappointment to headline writers, there were people who could still critique Modi’s statement.

“Betrays his total absence of intellectual prowess,” tweeted a journalist reacting to the comment.

“He doesn’t even know that teachers also teach in colleges and coaching institutes. Pity that this guy is seen as someone who could lead India,” the journalist added.

The tweet attracted hundreds of responses, but the wider world of experts and analysts remained livid with the controversial and polarizing Chief Minister for not giving any controversial or polarizing statement.

“We employ resources to track his movements. OB camera vans are there to beam live everything he says. We pay professional Modi critics and serial Modi supporters in advance to come exclusively on our news channels to debate. And then we get such a pathetic statement!” complained a senior executive with a leading news channel.

“Since the US constitution doesn’t allow a third term as a President, and Indian constitution doesn’t bar a foreign born person from fighting elections, I am planning to commence my political career in India,” Obama told Faking News.

Obama further told that he was planning to project himself as a “secular” alternative to Narendra Modi.

“Frankly I don’t know this secular-communal shit in Indian politics, I tried to read up but it’s all so mixed up,” Obama said, “But it appears that people are secular if they oppose Narendra Modi, so be it! I’ve already the support of 65 anti-Modi MPs.”

“I also have a Nobel Prize, so even Amartya Sen can’t oppose me,” he added.

Experts believe that Obama’s move could indeed create a major upset in 2014 general elections. Since Obama is amenable only to US Congress and not to Sonia Gandhi’s Congress, the current ruling party could start attacking Obama.

“Obama is reported to be keeping a small idol of Hanuman, and this information could be used by Digvijay Singh to claim that Obama was communal,” a political expert predicted.

BJP is confused as they don’t know how to react. While Obama’s presence could divide anti-Modi votes, there is a risk that Obama sweeps the elections and BJP could lose yet another election.

Sources further claim that recent visit by US VP Joe Biden was actually to find political allies for Obama. One of the electoral promises Obama could come up is to promise US visa to Indian professionals – something that could help him sweep elections in cities populated by IT professionals.

Among other strategies that Obama could adopt, is not to lose American accent even while speaking Hindi.

“Winning elections by speaking Hindi with an accent is not new to India. Someone did it before, Mr. Obama will do it again,” winked Obama’s personal adviser, who has finalized this retirement plan for the incumbent US President.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/obama.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/with-support-of-65-mps-obama-to-fight-next-general-elections-in-india-3325,"With support of 65 MPs, Obama to fight next general elections in India",,1374745078.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advanis-name-found-in-the-petition-signed-by-65-mps-against-us-visa-for-modi-3320,"New Delhi: An RTI query filed by Aam Admi Party has revealed that L.K. Advani also features in the list of 65 MPs who have requested big daddy ‘Barack Obama’ not to grant US Visa to Narendra Modi.

It came as a rude shock to BJP spokespersons who were ready to launch an all-out attack on those MPs in today’s news debates.

When contacted by Faking News, Advani refused to comment, citing an upset stomach.

Nirmala Sitaraman, the national spokesperson was too numb to comment on the development while Ravishankar Prasad was able to get back his composure and tried to outsmart everybody by saying, “Advani ji wants Modi ji to remain in India. So this is nothing but a safety measure from Advani ji. There is no need to read between the lines.”

On the other hand, UPA and its allies were in splits after this revelation. When our star reporter Shaitaan Khopdi™ asked Rahul Gandhi what does he think about Advani signing the petition against Modi, he responded with a counter question, “I ask YOU, what YOU think about this news?”

Shaitaan Khopdi™ went completely blank hearing the response. He was later admitted to nearest trauma and neuro care center. Faking News has cited the employment contract signed by him, and will not be paying for his treatment.

Meanwhile PM Manmohan Singh welcomed Advani’s secular gesture and said ‘Theek Hai’ before sheepishly scribbling ‘1301‘ in his notebook.

Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, maintained dignified silence on the complete episode. According his close aide, he is worried that if Modi remains in India, he will continue to be the best Indian CM and therefore front running PM candidate.

Expectedly, 24×7 news media went into tizzy after the news broke out. NDTV put up an article titled ‘Modi not an international leader?‘, which they later removed from their websites.

Arnab Goswami demanded that US wants to know why Advani backstabbed Modi. He has called Mr Modi, Mr Advani and Baba Siddiqui on the Newshour tonight to resolve the differences, while Rajdeep Sardesai is expected to tweet “Song for tonight – dost dost na raha.”

But far from this madding crowd, Daler Mehdi, the famous bhangra pop singer has shown some hope. “I am world famous in Punjab for spreading peace by sending pigeons to US. Since Modi ji is accused of violence; I will send him to US as a Pigeon, the symbol of peace. My Pigeons never return back, they permanently get settled in US or Canada. This will solve lot of problems. UPA can take a sigh of relief, Advani ji and Nitish ji can continue their PM dreams, and nation will get rid of the Modi-fied crap newspapers and news channels keep pouring over us daily,” concluded Daler Mehdi.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/UpsetAdvani.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advanis-name-found-in-the-petition-signed-by-65-mps-against-us-visa-for-modi-3320,Advani’s name found in the petition signed by 65 MPs against US Visa for Modi,,1374651113.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The applicant, Surender Sehrawat decided to file the application after he learned that Sheila Dixit was not responsible for the poor state of roads in the capital.

Speaking to Faking News, Mr. Sehrawat said, “Just like every year, I was cursing Sheila Dixit led Congress government after the roads in our village became rivers after a spell of rain, that’s when someone told me that I should be blaming BJP for the poor state of the roads as they control the municipal corporations. This got me thinking, what exactly is the responsibility of Delhi government.”

Sheila Dixit pointing towards someone who could probably be responsible

“We know for a fact that Sheila Dixit is not responsible for law and order in Delhi, now we know that she isn’t responsible for civil infrastructure in the city. She wasn’t responsible for any irregularities in the organization of Commonwealth Games. I don’t want to receive this news in installments; I want to know the things she is responsible for so that I blame her only for those”, he went on to add.

Mr. Sehrawat’s sentiments were echoed by several Delhi residents we interviewed. A Vasant Vihar resident, Mrs. Vaishali Bansal said, “Surely raising prices of electricity is not her only responsibility. There must be more to that job. I am also curious to know what it is. Every time someone raises a problem in Delhi, she says it’s not her responsibility and we should go somewhere else. In fact, yesterday she said we should pray to the God to get rid of water-logging!”

“Why do we need a CM then?” Mrs. Bansal wondered

While a resident of Shahdara, Mr. Yatin Goyal said, “What is the use of asking now. She has won 3 elections and now people wonder what exactly she does as CM of Delhi? She blames everyone else, that’s what she does. Blame BJP, Blame God, Blame Kejriwal, isn’t blaming so many people a full time job?”

When we tried to get Sheila Dixit’s reaction on this, she snapped at us and said, “This responsibility was given to me by the high-command. I am not answerable to you.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sheila-dixit.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-files-rti-to-find-out-what-exactly-is-sheila-dixit-responsible-for-3314,Man files RTI to find out what exactly is Sheila Dixit responsible for,,1374574982.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-novel-written-by-jk-rowling-discovered-rahul-putter-and-the-unfortunate-indians-3294,"New Delhi. After a crime novel, another novel written by JK Rowling under a pseudonym has been discovered. This time a political fantasy novel set in India titled “Rahul Putter and the Unfortunate Indians”.

This not-so-well-known book was written by “Janki Rai Singh” which has been revealed to be another pseudonym of JK Rowling.

This book attempts to make the protagonists in the original Harry Potter Series more life-like by having their personalities resemble real persons, so as to appeal more to adult sensibilities, especially in India.

“The story is based on a very powerful wizarding community called politicians who rule over ordinary muggles such as you and me,” JK Rowling explained. She admitted to have written the book in an exclusive interview with Faking News.

The good wizards, led by Rahul Putter, are gifted with extraordinary magical talent and have ordained that they will pull out, not rabbits, not pigeons, but near free food for a billion people out of their hat. No one knows how it will happen or where it will come from. It’s magic.

An exclusive picture of Rahul Puttar

“These wizards can also hang the parliament indefinitely in mid-air and make tax payers’ money disappear,” Rowling said, further detailing their magical capabilities.

Legend has it that Rahul Putter was only a baby when it was destined that he would become the “Chosen One.” He did not even have to lift so much as a finger or a wand. Instead, Rajiv Gandhi lifted his wand and gave it to Sonia.

“Love is the greatest magic of all,” Putter’s mother has since taught Volde Modi and others as she overthrew them took over the Indian government. She conquered Rajiv Gandhi’s heart and then an entire country. Avada Kedavra!

It is said that Sonia’s inter-racial sacrifice has made Putter omnipotent. “I named him Vice President of the Congress even before I named him Rahul,” Sonia is quoted in the novel.

Rahul Putter has been struggling to complete his Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.S) before he sits for Prime Minister.

“He is having trouble at school. He has still not learned how to make his broomstick fly. He only makes USDINR fly,” Hogwarts principal, Dumbledore says in the book.

Volde Modi is determined to confiscate power from these wizards through his powerful and unusual brand of magic, called “development”, a phenomenal magical feat which few wizards have dared to achieve until now.

Volde Modi sends shivers down the spines of members of the Putter camp. They are so terrified of him that they refuse to take his name. He rises to power gradually, growing stronger day by day, by summoning Facebook and Twitter followers, as well as people who don’t need free food, along his side.

He is also rumored to be offering VM tattoos, also known as the Dark Mark, for free through shady tattoo parlors in Ghatkopar and Chandivali. The tattoo is known to burn on the forearms of his followers every time the growth rate of Gujarat increases.

“Volde Modi is definitely one of the most talented students to have studied in Hogwarts,” said proud professor Dumbledore, referring to Volde Modi’s latest magical feat wherein he presented to us as many lives in 2013 as he vanished in 2002.

“The disappear & reappear magical act has been very popular in the wizarding community but so far it has only worked on pigeons and rabbits. This is the first time someone was able to apply the act on Gujaratis,” the professor points out.

When Manmohan Singh was asked to comment on any potential involvement of his government in influencing this plot of this Harry Potter sequel, he suddenly started banging his head on the wall and shrieking “Dobby no speak, Dobby no speak.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rahulg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-novel-written-by-jk-rowling-discovered-rahul-putter-and-the-unfortunate-indians-3294,Another novel written by JK Rowling discovered: Rahul Putter and the Unfortunate Indians,,1374309694.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A huge political storm broke out this morning when a dead rat was found in the Congress office located at Akbar Road. The rat was most probably dead due to hunger or due to a lethal attack by a hungry cat, but its death became the talking point of politics that followed.

“Congress office had either a hungry rat or a hungry cat. If they can’t take care of hunger of even those in office, how can they promise to eradicate hunger through Food Security Bill,” BJP leader Narendra Modi told a gathering of party supporters amidst thundering applause.

Sources tell Faking News that Ajay Maken is talking to Digvijay Singh in the above picture

The statement by Modi was debated widely on Twitter by trolls and journalists (not mutually exclusive groups) and people wondered if Modi was pro-rat or pro-cat.

“Forget his ideology, he has insulted every citizen of India by comparing them with rats and cats. Zero marks for sensitivity,” claimed a tweet that got 50 ret-tweets and 500 abuses.

While debate enraged on social and mainstream media, Congress jumped in to defend itself. In a hurriedly called press conference, Congress leader Ajay Maken said that Modi had no rights to talk about dead rats.

“We have confirmed reports that there are at least two dead rats in the Gujarat office of BJP,” Maken claimed, “One of the rats died of hunger while another was killed in a fake encounter.”

Maken further showed pictures of rat-poison sachets lying around BJP office to prove his point about fake encounter, though he didn’t comment on whether a dead rat was actually found in the Congress office.

He further pointed out to “rat biryani” being served in an Ahmedabad-bound train (though Indian Railways is under central government’s control) to prove how BJP’s record in this area was abysmal.

“With such a track record, how can he (Modi) attack Congress?” questioned the Congress leader trusted with media management ahead of the next general elections.

After repeated attempts by the opposition to politicize trivial issues like basic infrastructure, corruption, inflation, poor governance, terrorism, Chinese intrusions, etc., UPA has issued a comprehensive list of topics that can be politicized. UPA will have a political debate only on the topics mentioned in the list and will not be drawn into a debate on any other topic.

Speaking to the media, Mr. Manish Tewari said, “Opposition parties repeatedly try to take the focus away from the important points by politicizing unimportant and trivial issues. That is why we have issued this list detailing all the key issues facing modern day India. We will respond only when the opposition parties stick to these issues.”

Tewari also showed the range of intelligence that could be found in the ensuing debates

Mr. Tewari went on to add, “This is not a list that UPA came up with on its own. We have taken inputs from seasoned Indian economists and political analysts settled in USA, England, and Australia to prepare this list as they are well aware of the challenges facing India. It is only from their contribution that this list has been prepared.”

When we asked how those settled abroad know better about Indian problems, Mr. Tewari said, “See, when you are at a distance, it gives you a holistic view of things. You can appreciate the problem better. That is why even our dynamic leader Rahul Gandhi keeps going to Europe to help see Indian issues better.”

The comprehensive list of issues that can be politicized is published below. This is exclusively available on Faking news.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-showing-off-fake-osama-lalu-fakes-iftar-party-to-strengthen-his-secular-image-3237,"Patna. Lalu Prasad Yadav is a worried man these days. His cause of worry is his vote-bank being snapped by new secular on the block Nitish Kumar.

After enjoying the CM post for 7 year with BJP’s help, last month Nitish Kumar finally decided it was time to turn secular for 2014 polls. Lalu could see red flags flying all around. In a desperate attempt to emphasize on his secular credentials, Lalu Prasad Yadav held a grand iftar party at his residence yesterday.

He was expecting a turnout of around 1500-2000 people, but surprisingly all he could get was lot of media attention and some students of nearby engineering colleges who were waiting for an opportunity to get into the crowd and have a feast at Lalu’s expense.

Real Lalu Yadav with Fake Osama Bin Laden

To save the face in front of large media gathering, Lalu once again banked on his ability to fake things and quickly arranged for people dressed as ordinary Muslims and minority leaders who got on stage for grand photo op. Earlier, he had arranged for a fake Osama Bin Laden to attract Muslim votes, apart from faking support of people by booth capturing and later faking Rabri Devi as Bihar Chief Minister.

Sources tell Faking News that most of the people seen on stage were from a local drama company called Jor-daar Drama Undertaking (JDU). They are hoping to do a brisk business this Ramzan as lot of people would like to prove their secular image by hosting iftar parties and showing off fasting Muslims.

“Sometimes you will have to wear a cap, sometimes you will have to sport a tilak. We are actors and we have to act according to the situation at hand,” explained the drama company leader ‘Munna’.

The drama company got money and media got news, apart from free food, but the worst casualty amid all this drama were the engineering students who were thrown out of the premises. The students later staged a protest shouting slogans against Lalu.

“We are the most secular species in India. We enjoy all the festivals alike. A holiday is a holiday for us, no matter Diwali or Eid. How can a secular leader throw secular people out?” protested a student who is now waiting for Nitish Kumar to host iftar party.

Meanwhile the intended invitees of the iftar party were equally furious. One of them explained to our sources why none of them turned up at the event.

“This Lalu guy is in such a hurry that he held an iftar party even before Ramzan started. He might be an expert faker but we don’t fake our festivals,” said a fasting Abdul.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lalu_osama.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-showing-off-fake-osama-lalu-fakes-iftar-party-to-strengthen-his-secular-image-3237,"After showing off fake Osama, Lalu fakes iftar party to strengthen his secular image",,1373546639.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In what is being perceived as a total shift from their approach and strategy, Indian Mujahideen has today claimed to have defused over 100 bombs planted at Congress leader Digvijay Singh’s house over the last one year.

“We have received a letter where IM has claimed responsibility for defusing bombs, an unusual break from letters that claimed responsibilities for planting and blasting bombs,” a Delhi Police official disclosed.

Digvijay Singh has thanked the unidentified “mujahideen ji” for the kind act

Sources say IM claimed this responsibility after it feared that Digvijay Singh may give credit to RSS behind these defusions too.

Indian Mujahideen has further clarified that this was not any act of generosity even though many experts believe that IM is a group of innocent persons who are always falsely implicated by the evil security agencies of India.

Explaining their unusual conduct, terrorists from IM claim that statements of Digvijay Singh have done far greater damage to the psyche of Indians than the actual blasts they have carried out so far.

“With blasts we are only killing the people once, but Mr. Singh has gone on to the next level by altering the genes of Indians forever, which will continue to affect them for generations to come. We can’t lose such a precious asset,” an innocent terrorist of IM told Faking News.

After the news was put in public domain, Prime Minister condemned the act of Indian Mujahideen out of habit. However, he soon realized the changed scenario and congratulated Digvijay Singh for making dependable friends.

But not everyone is happy. Many on Twitter expressed concern over sinister design of the Indian Mujahideen.

“You know I can hope to come out alive and unscathed from these chhota-mota blasts, but these verbal blasts have proved to be fatal,” said a distraught person switching Indian news channels.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/digvijaya.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-mujahideen-diffuses-bombs-planted-at-digvijay-singhs-house-3217,Indian Mujahideen defuses bombs planted at Digvijay Singh’s house,,1373279448.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Impressed with the way politics started over blasts in Bodh Gaya within hours, terrorists have decided to stick to this module as this could cause maximum harm and damage to the Indian society.

“I don’t think we need to kill people. Let’s just do chhota mota blasts where people get injured, and rest of the job will be done by the honorable leaders and commentators of India,” a terrorist told Faking News.

Hopefully a non-controversial picture of a terrorist. For any complaints, please contact the South Park team at Comedy Central.

(Editor’s note: we are not publishing the name of the terrorist lest we are called communal and bigoted)

Before we could assume anything, the terrorist clarified that they had not undergone any change in heart and still believe in killing people mindlessly.

“We are taking a cost-effective measure,” the terrorist explained, “If we want to kill people, we have to hire well-trained suicide bombers from across the border. It’s not cheap to train and hire suicide bombers, apart from rising costs of terrorism due to general inflation.”

“A human being’s life might be cheap, but a terrorist’s life is not so cheap,” the terrorist added.

It should be noted that two men were injured in serial blasts in Bodh Gaya earlier today. Both of them are out of danger; such acts are generally termed “chhota mota” blasts by experts.

“If a lot of people die in terror attacks, sometimes it puts moral pressure on politicians and activists not to indulge in politics and conspiracy theories, as it could upset some citizens, but such chhota mota blasts are the best way to unleash them,” the terrorist explained the benefits of low intensity blasts.

The terrorist pointed out that the ensuing politics on blasts ensure that the worst in the Indian society comes out in open with every group accusing the rival group of indulging in the blats, thus sowing seeds of suspicion among the citizens.

“This helps us achieve our goal of converting the Indian society into a dysfunctional one, at a much more affordable price,” the terrorist reiterated.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-to-charge-apco-for-promoting-them-in-india-3193,"Gandhinagar. Gujarat Chief Minister Mr. Narendra Modi has issued a notice to Public Relations firm APCO Worldwide to pay him for promoting them in India since 2009.

The amount Modi is seeking remains undisclosed for the moment, but the notice has been sent directly to APCO’s head office in Washington DC.

This is the second surprising development in two days concerning APCO. Earlier on Sunday, APCO Worldwide had strongly denied that it works for Modi, a long held belief in India. As per APCO, they had a contract only with the state government to promote the Vibrant Gujarat summit and not with Mr. Narendra Modi.

Modi thinking if he could have sent APCO a bill for bigger amount

Speaking to the media, Mr. Modi’s personal aide said, “For the last few years, every positive news about Shri Narendra Modi has been attributed to APCO, even though they weren’t working for him as admitted by them. Through all this, APCO gained a lot of free publicity in India as the miracle company which can turn a common man into a PM candidate. Shouldn’t we charge them for all this publicity?”

“Mr. Modi got no credit for all his achievements from Indians as all his achievements were labeled a plant by APCO, now at least he should get some money for the same. For this amount of publicity, If APCO had hired someone like MS Dhoni, it would have cost them nearly a hundred crores plus the position of Vice-President, at least Modi ji is not aiming for the VP post!” he went on to add.

APCO has declined to comment on this issue. A press release by APCO said that the issue is under consideration as they contemplate whether to pay Modi or not.

An industry expert speaking to Faking News said, “I think APCO should pay up whatever Modi is asking and move on. Every politician in India knows them by now thanks to Mr. Modi. Election season is coming and God knows that we have more than a handful of politicians in need of an image makeover. Rahul Gandhi alone will run through 6-7 images in the run up to the elections. They shouldn’t risk bad PR at this stage when such a huge market is at stake.”

While APCO may pay op, sources confirm that leading news channels and websites in India are concerned that they could be the next target.

“Narendra Modi may ask them to pay a part of their revenues as he’s been getting TRPs and traffic for them, as admitted by one of them recently,” an expert explained the fears of media organizations.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-mulls-ordinance-to-keep-political-parties-out-of-election-commission-ambit-3191,"New Delhi. Worried by an Election Commission ruling that restricts expenditure by a candidate contesting elections to Rs 40 lakhs, the government has reached a consensus with all parties and is drafting an ordinance to keep political parties out of the ambit of Election Commission.

After this new law, the code of conduct for political parties shall be regulated by a new body to be named as All Party NAtional Election Commission (Apna EC). Office bearers of Apna EC shall be picked from various political parties and it will function independent of Election Commission.

Fighting elections with small change now not possible

A consensus is developing on the name of Gopinath Munde as the first Chief Apna Election Commissioner – CAEC.

“The first orders to be passed by me shall be the removal of any ceiling on the expenditure made by a candidate during elections. Instead a minimum floor amount of Rs 2 crores shall have to be spent by the candidate to avoid disqualification,” Munde said

“Anyone spending less than two crore rupees is stooping too low,” commented Abhishek Manu Singhvi of the Congress party, “This is in line with meeting minimum standards such as not recognizing a scam of mere 71 lakhs rupees as any scam.”

Bhola Ram Yadav, another likely nominee member to Apna EC from the Samajwadi quota, commented on the election reforms, “All contesting candidates must have at least two criminal cases pending against them where conviction has taken place. This will establish the bona fide’ of the candidate for having the necessary administrative and organizational skills to be part of an effective government.”

“Currency notes of Rs 5000 and 20000 denominations are a must to eliminate logistics problems faced by parties during the election process,” a DMK member is likely to put up this demand as soon as Apna EC is in place after the ordinance.

P Chidambaram’s proposal to bring in election funding through the FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) route will also have smooth sailing once Apna EC is in place. This will also bring in the much needed foreign exchange to support the falling rupee.

Congress leader V Narayanasamy said, “When the time comes to bring transparency in their own functioning, all the political parties are game for it. It is only the Election Commissions rules which were a deterrent. Now with new rules framed by Apna EC and the Right to Information amended, most parties will be fully compliant in next one year.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bundles.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-mulls-ordinance-to-keep-political-parties-out-of-election-commission-ambit-3191,Government mulls ordinance to keep political parties out of Election Commission ambit,,1372515168.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/can-we-start-taking-bribes-because-we-are-secular-now-ask-bihari-babus-3188,"Patna. Bureaucrats in Bihar have asked the government of Bihar to allow them to indulge in enhanced levels of corruption and bribery as the ruling alliance was fully ‘secular’ now.

“It is an established rule in our country where unchecked corruption is tolerated to keep communal forces out of power. A citizen is expected to pay ‘secular premium’ in form of bribes,” a senior secretary working with the Government of Bihar claimed.

“Now that the communal forces are out of the ruling alliance in the state and the government has been upgraded to the ‘secular’ stage, we should be allowed to upgrade ourselves to the next stage of corruption,” the senior secretary argued.

Maybe Nitish Kumar hadn’t seen such challenges coming in after becoming secular

Sources tell Faking News that a group of bureaucrats are planning to meet Chief Minister Nitish Kumar early next week and ask for a “green signal” for indulging in advanced corruption.

“We are pretty confident of a positive response from the CM as he can’t say no to any ‘green’ thing, else he could be termed as a ‘communal’ person,” the secretary claimed.

Experts believe that Nitish Kumar, though priding himself on providing sushasan (good governance) to the citizens of Bihar, could yield to babus’ demands because he is reported to believe and trust bureaucrats more than even the workers of his party.

“Bureaucrats of Bihar would rather prefer a corrupt RJD rule where they can loot earn a lot more, so Nitish Kumar may not have any other choice,” a political expert analyzed the situation for the Bihar CM.

Experts further point out that after the break-up of the ruling NDA alliance, Bihar had become like another Uttar Pradesh with RJD and JD(U) being similar to BSP and SP in local politics.

“We had earlier seen that SP’s Shivpal Yadav had openly told the Uttar Pradesh bureaucrats that ‘they can steal but not be dacoits’, Nitish Kumar could start with a similar statement,” the expert suggested.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/with-support-of-65-mps-obama-to-fight-next-general-elections-in-india-3325,"Washington, DC. After 65 Indian MPs involved him in domestic politics of India, US President Barack Obama is taking a keen interest in Indian politics and planning a more pro-active role.

“I didn’t knew so many Indian parliamentarians have such a deep faith in me, I’m touched,” said a happy Obama after receiving the letter signed by 65 MPs from India, twice over a period of few weeks.

“Since the US constitution doesn’t allow a third term as a President, and Indian constitution doesn’t bar a foreign born person from fighting elections, I am planning to commence my political career in India,” Obama told Faking News.

Obama couldn’t control his laughter when he was told that he’d be counted as one of the young leaders of India when he makes his political debut.

Obama further told that he was planning to project himself as a “secular” alternative to Narendra Modi.

“Frankly I don’t know this secular-communal shit in Indian politics, I tried to read up but it’s all so mixed up,” Obama said, “But it appears that people are secular if they oppose Narendra Modi, so be it! I’ve already the support of 65 anti-Modi MPs.”

“I also have a Nobel Prize, so even Amartya Sen can’t oppose me,” he added.

Experts believe that Obama’s move could indeed create a major upset in 2014 general elections. Since Obama is amenable only to US Congress and not to Sonia Gandhi’s Congress, the current ruling party could start attacking Obama.

“Obama is reported to be keeping a small idol of Hanuman, and this information could be used by Digvijay Singh to claim that Obama was communal,” a political expert predicted.

BJP is confused as they don’t know how to react. While Obama’s presence could divide anti-Modi votes, there is a risk that Obama sweeps the elections and BJP could lose yet another election.

Sources further claim that recent visit by US VP Joe Biden was actually to find political allies for Obama. One of the electoral promises Obama could come up is to promise US visa to Indian professionals – something that could help him sweep elections in cities populated by IT professionals.

Among other strategies that Obama could adopt, is not to lose American accent even while speaking Hindi.

“Winning elections by speaking Hindi with an accent is not new to India. Someone did it before, Mr. Obama will do it again,” winked Obama’s personal adviser, who has finalized this retirement plan for the incumbent US President.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/obama.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/with-support-of-65-mps-obama-to-fight-next-general-elections-in-india-3325,"With support of 65 MPs, Obama to fight next general elections in India",,1374745078.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advanis-name-found-in-the-petition-signed-by-65-mps-against-us-visa-for-modi-3320,"New Delhi: An RTI query filed by Aam Admi Party has revealed that L.K. Advani also features in the list of 65 MPs who have requested big daddy ‘Barack Obama’ not to grant US Visa to Narendra Modi.

It came as a rude shock to BJP spokespersons who were ready to launch an all-out attack on those MPs in today’s news debates.

When contacted by Faking News, Advani refused to comment, citing an upset stomach.

Nirmala Sitaraman, the national spokesperson was too numb to comment on the development while Ravishankar Prasad was able to get back his composure and tried to outsmart everybody by saying, “Advani ji wants Modi ji to remain in India. So this is nothing but a safety measure from Advani ji. There is no need to read between the lines.”

On the other hand, UPA and its allies were in splits after this revelation. When our star reporter Shaitaan Khopdi™ asked Rahul Gandhi what does he think about Advani signing the petition against Modi, he responded with a counter question, “I ask YOU, what YOU think about this news?”

Shaitaan Khopdi™ went completely blank hearing the response. He was later admitted to nearest trauma and neuro care center. Faking News has cited the employment contract signed by him, and will not be paying for his treatment.

Meanwhile PM Manmohan Singh welcomed Advani’s secular gesture and said ‘Theek Hai’ before sheepishly scribbling ‘1301‘ in his notebook.

Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, maintained dignified silence on the complete episode. According his close aide, he is worried that if Modi remains in India, he will continue to be the best Indian CM and therefore front running PM candidate.

Expectedly, 24×7 news media went into tizzy after the news broke out. NDTV put up an article titled ‘Modi not an international leader?‘, which they later removed from their websites.

Arnab Goswami demanded that US wants to know why Advani backstabbed Modi. He has called Mr Modi, Mr Advani and Baba Siddiqui on the Newshour tonight to resolve the differences, while Rajdeep Sardesai is expected to tweet “Song for tonight – dost dost na raha.”

But far from this madding crowd, Daler Mehdi, the famous bhangra pop singer has shown some hope. “I am world famous in Punjab for spreading peace by sending pigeons to US. Since Modi ji is accused of violence; I will send him to US as a Pigeon, the symbol of peace. My Pigeons never return back, they permanently get settled in US or Canada. This will solve lot of problems. UPA can take a sigh of relief, Advani ji and Nitish ji can continue their PM dreams, and nation will get rid of the Modi-fied crap newspapers and news channels keep pouring over us daily,” concluded Daler Mehdi.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/UpsetAdvani.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/advanis-name-found-in-the-petition-signed-by-65-mps-against-us-visa-for-modi-3320,Advani’s name found in the petition signed by 65 MPs against US Visa for Modi,,1374651113.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The applicant, Surender Sehrawat decided to file the application after he learned that Sheila Dixit was not responsible for the poor state of roads in the capital.

Speaking to Faking News, Mr. Sehrawat said, “Just like every year, I was cursing Sheila Dixit led Congress government after the roads in our village became rivers after a spell of rain, that’s when someone told me that I should be blaming BJP for the poor state of the roads as they control the municipal corporations. This got me thinking, what exactly is the responsibility of Delhi government.”

Sheila Dixit pointing towards someone who could probably be responsible

“We know for a fact that Sheila Dixit is not responsible for law and order in Delhi, now we know that she isn’t responsible for civil infrastructure in the city. She wasn’t responsible for any irregularities in the organization of Commonwealth Games. I don’t want to receive this news in installments; I want to know the things she is responsible for so that I blame her only for those”, he went on to add.

Mr. Sehrawat’s sentiments were echoed by several Delhi residents we interviewed. A Vasant Vihar resident, Mrs. Vaishali Bansal said, “Surely raising prices of electricity is not her only responsibility. There must be more to that job. I am also curious to know what it is. Every time someone raises a problem in Delhi, she says it’s not her responsibility and we should go somewhere else. In fact, yesterday she said we should pray to the God to get rid of water-logging!”

“Why do we need a CM then?” Mrs. Bansal wondered

While a resident of Shahdara, Mr. Yatin Goyal said, “What is the use of asking now. She has won 3 elections and now people wonder what exactly she does as CM of Delhi? She blames everyone else, that’s what she does. Blame BJP, Blame God, Blame Kejriwal, isn’t blaming so many people a full time job?”

When we tried to get Sheila Dixit’s reaction on this, she snapped at us and said, “This responsibility was given to me by the high-command. I am not answerable to you.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sheila-dixit.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/man-files-rti-to-find-out-what-exactly-is-sheila-dixit-responsible-for-3314,Man files RTI to find out what exactly is Sheila Dixit responsible for,,1374574982.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-novel-written-by-jk-rowling-discovered-rahul-putter-and-the-unfortunate-indians-3294,"New Delhi. After a crime novel, another novel written by JK Rowling under a pseudonym has been discovered. This time a political fantasy novel set in India titled “Rahul Putter and the Unfortunate Indians”.

This not-so-well-known book was written by “Janki Rai Singh” which has been revealed to be another pseudonym of JK Rowling.

This book attempts to make the protagonists in the original Harry Potter Series more life-like by having their personalities resemble real persons, so as to appeal more to adult sensibilities, especially in India.

“The story is based on a very powerful wizarding community called politicians who rule over ordinary muggles such as you and me,” JK Rowling explained. She admitted to have written the book in an exclusive interview with Faking News.

The good wizards, led by Rahul Putter, are gifted with extraordinary magical talent and have ordained that they will pull out, not rabbits, not pigeons, but near free food for a billion people out of their hat. No one knows how it will happen or where it will come from. It’s magic.

An exclusive picture of Rahul Puttar

“These wizards can also hang the parliament indefinitely in mid-air and make tax payers’ money disappear,” Rowling said, further detailing their magical capabilities.

Legend has it that Rahul Putter was only a baby when it was destined that he would become the “Chosen One.” He did not even have to lift so much as a finger or a wand. Instead, Rajiv Gandhi lifted his wand and gave it to Sonia.

“Love is the greatest magic of all,” Putter’s mother has since taught Volde Modi and others as she overthrew them took over the Indian government. She conquered Rajiv Gandhi’s heart and then an entire country. Avada Kedavra!

It is said that Sonia’s inter-racial sacrifice has made Putter omnipotent. “I named him Vice President of the Congress even before I named him Rahul,” Sonia is quoted in the novel.

Rahul Putter has been struggling to complete his Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.S) before he sits for Prime Minister.

“He is having trouble at school. He has still not learned how to make his broomstick fly. He only makes USDINR fly,” Hogwarts principal, Dumbledore says in the book.

Volde Modi is determined to confiscate power from these wizards through his powerful and unusual brand of magic, called “development”, a phenomenal magical feat which few wizards have dared to achieve until now.

Volde Modi sends shivers down the spines of members of the Putter camp. They are so terrified of him that they refuse to take his name. He rises to power gradually, growing stronger day by day, by summoning Facebook and Twitter followers, as well as people who don’t need free food, along his side.

He is also rumored to be offering VM tattoos, also known as the Dark Mark, for free through shady tattoo parlors in Ghatkopar and Chandivali. The tattoo is known to burn on the forearms of his followers every time the growth rate of Gujarat increases.

“Volde Modi is definitely one of the most talented students to have studied in Hogwarts,” said proud professor Dumbledore, referring to Volde Modi’s latest magical feat wherein he presented to us as many lives in 2013 as he vanished in 2002.

“The disappear & reappear magical act has been very popular in the wizarding community but so far it has only worked on pigeons and rabbits. This is the first time someone was able to apply the act on Gujaratis,” the professor points out.

When Manmohan Singh was asked to comment on any potential involvement of his government in influencing this plot of this Harry Potter sequel, he suddenly started banging his head on the wall and shrieking “Dobby no speak, Dobby no speak.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rahulg.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-novel-written-by-jk-rowling-discovered-rahul-putter-and-the-unfortunate-indians-3294,Another novel written by JK Rowling discovered: Rahul Putter and the Unfortunate Indians,,1374309694.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A huge political storm broke out this morning when a dead rat was found in the Congress office located at Akbar Road. The rat was most probably dead due to hunger or due to a lethal attack by a hungry cat, but its death became the talking point of politics that followed.

“Congress office had either a hungry rat or a hungry cat. If they can’t take care of hunger of even those in office, how can they promise to eradicate hunger through Food Security Bill,” BJP leader Narendra Modi told a gathering of party supporters amidst thundering applause.

Sources tell Faking News that Ajay Maken is talking to Digvijay Singh in the above picture

The statement by Modi was debated widely on Twitter by trolls and journalists (not mutually exclusive groups) and people wondered if Modi was pro-rat or pro-cat.

“Forget his ideology, he has insulted every citizen of India by comparing them with rats and cats. Zero marks for sensitivity,” claimed a tweet that got 50 ret-tweets and 500 abuses.

While debate enraged on social and mainstream media, Congress jumped in to defend itself. In a hurriedly called press conference, Congress leader Ajay Maken said that Modi had no rights to talk about dead rats.

“We have confirmed reports that there are at least two dead rats in the Gujarat office of BJP,” Maken claimed, “One of the rats died of hunger while another was killed in a fake encounter.”

Maken further showed pictures of rat-poison sachets lying around BJP office to prove his point about fake encounter, though he didn’t comment on whether a dead rat was actually found in the Congress office.

He further pointed out to “rat biryani” being served in an Ahmedabad-bound train (though Indian Railways is under central government’s control) to prove how BJP’s record in this area was abysmal.

“With such a track record, how can he (Modi) attack Congress?” questioned the Congress leader trusted with media management ahead of the next general elections.

After repeated attempts by the opposition to politicize trivial issues like basic infrastructure, corruption, inflation, poor governance, terrorism, Chinese intrusions, etc., UPA has issued a comprehensive list of topics that can be politicized. UPA will have a political debate only on the topics mentioned in the list and will not be drawn into a debate on any other topic.

Speaking to the media, Mr. Manish Tewari said, “Opposition parties repeatedly try to take the focus away from the important points by politicizing unimportant and trivial issues. That is why we have issued this list detailing all the key issues facing modern day India. We will respond only when the opposition parties stick to these issues.”

Tewari also showed the range of intelligence that could be found in the ensuing debates

Mr. Tewari went on to add, “This is not a list that UPA came up with on its own. We have taken inputs from seasoned Indian economists and political analysts settled in USA, England, and Australia to prepare this list as they are well aware of the challenges facing India. It is only from their contribution that this list has been prepared.”

When we asked how those settled abroad know better about Indian problems, Mr. Tewari said, “See, when you are at a distance, it gives you a holistic view of things. You can appreciate the problem better. That is why even our dynamic leader Rahul Gandhi keeps going to Europe to help see Indian issues better.”

The comprehensive list of issues that can be politicized is published below. This is exclusively available on Faking news.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-showing-off-fake-osama-lalu-fakes-iftar-party-to-strengthen-his-secular-image-3237,"Patna. Lalu Prasad Yadav is a worried man these days. His cause of worry is his vote-bank being snapped by new secular on the block Nitish Kumar.

After enjoying the CM post for 7 year with BJP’s help, last month Nitish Kumar finally decided it was time to turn secular for 2014 polls. Lalu could see red flags flying all around. In a desperate attempt to emphasize on his secular credentials, Lalu Prasad Yadav held a grand iftar party at his residence yesterday.

He was expecting a turnout of around 1500-2000 people, but surprisingly all he could get was lot of media attention and some students of nearby engineering colleges who were waiting for an opportunity to get into the crowd and have a feast at Lalu’s expense.

Real Lalu Yadav with Fake Osama Bin Laden

To save the face in front of large media gathering, Lalu once again banked on his ability to fake things and quickly arranged for people dressed as ordinary Muslims and minority leaders who got on stage for grand photo op. Earlier, he had arranged for a fake Osama Bin Laden to attract Muslim votes, apart from faking support of people by booth capturing and later faking Rabri Devi as Bihar Chief Minister.

Sources tell Faking News that most of the people seen on stage were from a local drama company called Jor-daar Drama Undertaking (JDU). They are hoping to do a brisk business this Ramzan as lot of people would like to prove their secular image by hosting iftar parties and showing off fasting Muslims.

“Sometimes you will have to wear a cap, sometimes you will have to sport a tilak. We are actors and we have to act according to the situation at hand,” explained the drama company leader ‘Munna’.

The drama company got money and media got news, apart from free food, but the worst casualty amid all this drama were the engineering students who were thrown out of the premises. The students later staged a protest shouting slogans against Lalu.

“We are the most secular species in India. We enjoy all the festivals alike. A holiday is a holiday for us, no matter Diwali or Eid. How can a secular leader throw secular people out?” protested a student who is now waiting for Nitish Kumar to host iftar party.

Meanwhile the intended invitees of the iftar party were equally furious. One of them explained to our sources why none of them turned up at the event.

“This Lalu guy is in such a hurry that he held an iftar party even before Ramzan started. He might be an expert faker but we don’t fake our festivals,” said a fasting Abdul.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lalu_osama.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-showing-off-fake-osama-lalu-fakes-iftar-party-to-strengthen-his-secular-image-3237,"After showing off fake Osama, Lalu fakes iftar party to strengthen his secular image",,1373546639.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In what is being perceived as a total shift from their approach and strategy, Indian Mujahideen has today claimed to have defused over 100 bombs planted at Congress leader Digvijay Singh’s house over the last one year.

“We have received a letter where IM has claimed responsibility for defusing bombs, an unusual break from letters that claimed responsibilities for planting and blasting bombs,” a Delhi Police official disclosed.

Digvijay Singh has thanked the unidentified “mujahideen ji” for the kind act

Sources say IM claimed this responsibility after it feared that Digvijay Singh may give credit to RSS behind these defusions too.

Indian Mujahideen has further clarified that this was not any act of generosity even though many experts believe that IM is a group of innocent persons who are always falsely implicated by the evil security agencies of India.

Explaining their unusual conduct, terrorists from IM claim that statements of Digvijay Singh have done far greater damage to the psyche of Indians than the actual blasts they have carried out so far.

“With blasts we are only killing the people once, but Mr. Singh has gone on to the next level by altering the genes of Indians forever, which will continue to affect them for generations to come. We can’t lose such a precious asset,” an innocent terrorist of IM told Faking News.

After the news was put in public domain, Prime Minister condemned the act of Indian Mujahideen out of habit. However, he soon realized the changed scenario and congratulated Digvijay Singh for making dependable friends.

But not everyone is happy. Many on Twitter expressed concern over sinister design of the Indian Mujahideen.

“You know I can hope to come out alive and unscathed from these chhota-mota blasts, but these verbal blasts have proved to be fatal,” said a distraught person switching Indian news channels.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/digvijaya.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-mujahideen-diffuses-bombs-planted-at-digvijay-singhs-house-3217,Indian Mujahideen defuses bombs planted at Digvijay Singh’s house,,1373279448.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Impressed with the way politics started over blasts in Bodh Gaya within hours, terrorists have decided to stick to this module as this could cause maximum harm and damage to the Indian society.

“I don’t think we need to kill people. Let’s just do chhota mota blasts where people get injured, and rest of the job will be done by the honorable leaders and commentators of India,” a terrorist told Faking News.

Hopefully a non-controversial picture of a terrorist. For any complaints, please contact the South Park team at Comedy Central.

(Editor’s note: we are not publishing the name of the terrorist lest we are called communal and bigoted)

Before we could assume anything, the terrorist clarified that they had not undergone any change in heart and still believe in killing people mindlessly.

“We are taking a cost-effective measure,” the terrorist explained, “If we want to kill people, we have to hire well-trained suicide bombers from across the border. It’s not cheap to train and hire suicide bombers, apart from rising costs of terrorism due to general inflation.”

“A human being’s life might be cheap, but a terrorist’s life is not so cheap,” the terrorist added.

It should be noted that two men were injured in serial blasts in Bodh Gaya earlier today. Both of them are out of danger; such acts are generally termed “chhota mota” blasts by experts.

“If a lot of people die in terror attacks, sometimes it puts moral pressure on politicians and activists not to indulge in politics and conspiracy theories, as it could upset some citizens, but such chhota mota blasts are the best way to unleash them,” the terrorist explained the benefits of low intensity blasts.

The terrorist pointed out that the ensuing politics on blasts ensure that the worst in the Indian society comes out in open with every group accusing the rival group of indulging in the blats, thus sowing seeds of suspicion among the citizens.

“This helps us achieve our goal of converting the Indian society into a dysfunctional one, at a much more affordable price,” the terrorist reiterated.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-to-charge-apco-for-promoting-them-in-india-3193,"Gandhinagar. Gujarat Chief Minister Mr. Narendra Modi has issued a notice to Public Relations firm APCO Worldwide to pay him for promoting them in India since 2009.

The amount Modi is seeking remains undisclosed for the moment, but the notice has been sent directly to APCO’s head office in Washington DC.

This is the second surprising development in two days concerning APCO. Earlier on Sunday, APCO Worldwide had strongly denied that it works for Modi, a long held belief in India. As per APCO, they had a contract only with the state government to promote the Vibrant Gujarat summit and not with Mr. Narendra Modi.

Modi thinking if he could have sent APCO a bill for bigger amount

Speaking to the media, Mr. Modi’s personal aide said, “For the last few years, every positive news about Shri Narendra Modi has been attributed to APCO, even though they weren’t working for him as admitted by them. Through all this, APCO gained a lot of free publicity in India as the miracle company which can turn a common man into a PM candidate. Shouldn’t we charge them for all this publicity?”

“Mr. Modi got no credit for all his achievements from Indians as all his achievements were labeled a plant by APCO, now at least he should get some money for the same. For this amount of publicity, If APCO had hired someone like MS Dhoni, it would have cost them nearly a hundred crores plus the position of Vice-President, at least Modi ji is not aiming for the VP post!” he went on to add.

APCO has declined to comment on this issue. A press release by APCO said that the issue is under consideration as they contemplate whether to pay Modi or not.

An industry expert speaking to Faking News said, “I think APCO should pay up whatever Modi is asking and move on. Every politician in India knows them by now thanks to Mr. Modi. Election season is coming and God knows that we have more than a handful of politicians in need of an image makeover. Rahul Gandhi alone will run through 6-7 images in the run up to the elections. They shouldn’t risk bad PR at this stage when such a huge market is at stake.”

While APCO may pay op, sources confirm that leading news channels and websites in India are concerned that they could be the next target.

“Narendra Modi may ask them to pay a part of their revenues as he’s been getting TRPs and traffic for them, as admitted by one of them recently,” an expert explained the fears of media organizations.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-mulls-ordinance-to-keep-political-parties-out-of-election-commission-ambit-3191,"New Delhi. Worried by an Election Commission ruling that restricts expenditure by a candidate contesting elections to Rs 40 lakhs, the government has reached a consensus with all parties and is drafting an ordinance to keep political parties out of the ambit of Election Commission.

After this new law, the code of conduct for political parties shall be regulated by a new body to be named as All Party NAtional Election Commission (Apna EC). Office bearers of Apna EC shall be picked from various political parties and it will function independent of Election Commission.

Fighting elections with small change now not possible

A consensus is developing on the name of Gopinath Munde as the first Chief Apna Election Commissioner – CAEC.

“The first orders to be passed by me shall be the removal of any ceiling on the expenditure made by a candidate during elections. Instead a minimum floor amount of Rs 2 crores shall have to be spent by the candidate to avoid disqualification,” Munde said

“Anyone spending less than two crore rupees is stooping too low,” commented Abhishek Manu Singhvi of the Congress party, “This is in line with meeting minimum standards such as not recognizing a scam of mere 71 lakhs rupees as any scam.”

Bhola Ram Yadav, another likely nominee member to Apna EC from the Samajwadi quota, commented on the election reforms, “All contesting candidates must have at least two criminal cases pending against them where conviction has taken place. This will establish the bona fide’ of the candidate for having the necessary administrative and organizational skills to be part of an effective government.”

“Currency notes of Rs 5000 and 20000 denominations are a must to eliminate logistics problems faced by parties during the election process,” a DMK member is likely to put up this demand as soon as Apna EC is in place after the ordinance.

P Chidambaram’s proposal to bring in election funding through the FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) route will also have smooth sailing once Apna EC is in place. This will also bring in the much needed foreign exchange to support the falling rupee.

Congress leader V Narayanasamy said, “When the time comes to bring transparency in their own functioning, all the political parties are game for it. It is only the Election Commissions rules which were a deterrent. Now with new rules framed by Apna EC and the Right to Information amended, most parties will be fully compliant in next one year.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bundles.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-mulls-ordinance-to-keep-political-parties-out-of-election-commission-ambit-3191,Government mulls ordinance to keep political parties out of Election Commission ambit,,1372515168.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“It is an established rule in our country where unchecked corruption is tolerated to keep communal forces out of power. A citizen is expected to pay ‘secular premium’ in form of bribes,” a senior secretary working with the Government of Bihar claimed.

“Now that the communal forces are out of the ruling alliance in the state and the government has been upgraded to the ‘secular’ stage, we should be allowed to upgrade ourselves to the next stage of corruption,” the senior secretary argued.

Maybe Nitish Kumar hadn’t seen such challenges coming in after becoming secular

“We are pretty confident of a positive response from the CM as he can’t say no to any ‘green’ thing, else he could be termed as a ‘communal’ person,” the secretary claimed.

Experts believe that Nitish Kumar, though priding himself on providing sushasan (good governance) to the citizens of Bihar, could yield to babus’ demands because he is reported to believe and trust bureaucrats more than even the workers of his party.

“Bureaucrats of Bihar would rather prefer a corrupt RJD rule where they can loot earn a lot more, so Nitish Kumar may not have any other choice,” a political expert analyzed the situation for the Bihar CM.

Experts further point out that after the break-up of the ruling NDA alliance, Bihar had become like another Uttar Pradesh with RJD and JD(U) being similar to BSP and SP in local politics.

“We had earlier seen that SP’s Shivpal Yadav had openly told the Uttar Pradesh bureaucrats that ‘they can steal but not be dacoits’, Nitish Kumar could start with a similar statement,” the expert suggested.

Nitish Kumar was unavailable for comment because he was busy checking if Google auto-complete had started suggesting the term “secular” when the phrase “Nitish Kumar is” is typed in the search box.

Google approves the secular credentials of Nitish Kumar?

And he was happy when the reports last came in.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nitish.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/can-we-start-taking-bribes-because-we-are-secular-now-ask-bihari-babus-3188,“Can we start taking more bribes because we are more secular now?”,,1372501980.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a bid to increase the number of people rescued by them from Flood-hit Uttarakhand, politicians from Andhra Pradesh ended up taking several residents of Dehradun to Hyderabad with them. A group of 50 Dehradun residents are currently stranded in Hyderabad after being taken away by these politicians who had gone to Uttarakhand for rescue works.

This news comes right on the heels of the news of a fist fight between Congress and Telugu Desam Party’s politicians over providing assistance to pilgrims from Andhra Pradesh stranded in Uttarakhand. The wrestling match between them ended in a tie so they are now trying to beat each other in the number of people rescued by them.

Concerned politicians coming to blows over the plight of stranded citizens

Speaking to Faking News, one of the stranded people, Atul Bhandari said, “Sir, I work at the Dehradun airport. Some people came and offered me 1,000 Rs to sit inside a plane for a few minutes. They said they will just click some photos and let me go, next thing I know the plane took off and I ended up in Hyderabad.”

“On board the flight, I found out that there were several others like me who were promised 500 to 1500 Rupees to get on board the aircraft. After reaching Hyderabad, we were paraded in front of the waiting media at the airport who clicked several pictures of the ‘recued pilgrims’. The politicians left after the photo session, leaving us behind at the airport. Now, we don’t have the money to book a flight back to Dehradun and are stuck here!” Atul went on to say.

When we raised the issue with a local politician in Hyderabad, he said, “There must have been some confusion. We were rescuing every person who looked in the need of a rescue and there may have been some mix-up in one or two cases.”

When we asked whether the competition between political parties is affecting rescue work on ground, he said, “There was no competition between the political parties to take away more people from Uttarakhand. Yes there was a scuffle at the airport but you should not politicize the fight between two political parties.”

When asked whether they are making any arrangements to send these people back to Uttarakhand, the politician said, “We have already hired a charter plane to send these people back to Dehradun. We are just waiting for someone from high command to come and flag off this plane.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mins_fight.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dehradun-residents-end-up-in-hyderabad-after-the-rescue-efforts-of-andhra-politicians-3180,Dehradun residents end up in Hyderabad after the rescue efforts of Andhra politicians,,1372326475.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

There were rumors of him being in Spain, but since it was suggested by Subramanian Swamy on Twitter, there was confusion if Spain referred to a country or some code-word like TDK, CRT, PT, et al.

Rahul Gandhi is expected to come out victorious soon from his hiding

However, towards the end of the day, the Congress party clarified that Rahul Gandhi had planned an elaborate Hide-and-Seek game (also known as Luka-Chhupi in Hindi) on the occasion of his birthday, and he had won the game as no one could find where he was hiding.

“Just another achievement by Rahul Gandhi ji,” declared a spokesperson of Congress party in an exclusive interview to Faking News.

Sources confirmed that many took part in the national game and tried to find Rahul Gandhi during the day but they couldn’t spot him anywhere except in tweets by fans and haters alike.

“It is not easy to outsmart Rahul Gandhi ji,” senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, “The fact that he won against the whole country proves that he’s ready to lead the nation.”

Earlier, Rahul Gandhi was reported to have won Ludo and Snake-&-Ladders games, but those involved only two players in private settings. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has won in public.

However, BJP is not impressed.

“This is a fixed match. Congressis are playing amongst themselves. The truth is that Rahul baba is hiding because he’s afraid of NaMo,” claimed a BJP supporter on Twitter.

“I congratulate Rahul Gandhi on winning the game.

Sensing the market conditions that will see an increased demand of secular goods by Indian politicians, China has decided to manufacture skullcaps, which has been the best-selling secular product in the Indian political marketplace.

“Elections in India are near and there is already a rush among the politicians to prove themselves more secular than the others. So much so, that even LK Advani is appearing secular. In such a scenario, we expect politicians to go that extra mile to prove their secular credentials, and we want to provide that extra mile,” To Pi, a Chinese manufacturer told Faking News.

To Pi gave this expression when asked if he saw India becoming a bigger superpower than China due to its politics and policies

Hoping to grab the first mover advantage, To Pi showcased a new range of designer skullcaps that will cater to the high end secularism market under the brand name SKAPS.

“These caps are fitted with glowing LEDs, so even if there is a power failure at a function, or journalists’ camera flashes start malfunctioning, the caps will be clearly visible, thus underscoring the secular credential of the wearer,” the Chinese businessman explained the benefits of his latest product poised to flood the Indian market.

To Pi rued that manufacturers like him missed the earlier opportunity of making designer “Main Bhi Anna” caps.

“We don’t want to lose another business opportunity,” To Pi said, “We have already received an order from the Congress party of India, while we are evaluating Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s proposal for an special status exclusive partnership.”

Unconfirmed sources claim that China has already contracted laborers from Pakistan.

“No, no, not to manufacture skullcaps. China can produce those in-house. Some manufacturers were thinking of creating a fake Osama Bin Laden and that’s where Pakistani expertise will be of help; you know, a fake Osama was used by Lalu Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan during Bihar assembly elections a few years ago,” a source explained.

Apart from secular goods, Chinese manufacturers are planning to supply other political products that would be in high demand as the general elections in India get nearer; products such as flags of political parties, masks of Narendra Modi, and mini audio amplifiers playing ‘clapping’ and ‘zindabad’ sounds repetitively.

“We may not be a democratic country, but we too want to take part in the democratic process of our neighbors,” To Pi tried to give a spin to his business decision.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chinese_man.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/china-eyes-secularism-market-in-india-plans-to-manufacture-skullcaps-3156,"China eyes secularism market in India, plans to manufacture skullcaps",,1371555033.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After being denied divorce by family courts even though the couple mutually wanted to end their marriage, Nitish and Sushila have now filed a fresh petition for divorce citing their irreversible disagreement on Narendra Modi.

“Courts would always ask us to go back and try to make it work when we cited reasons like opposite lifestyles and life-goals. They will ask us to wait for a few months before taking a final decision on breaking the marriage; it was frustrating,” 41-year-old Nitish told Faking News.

However, Nitish is now confident that courts would grant him divorce as the relationship between him and his wife has reached a tipping point – they just can’t agree over Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

Critics claim that this posture suggests a direct fight between the left and the right (hands)

“There is no scope for any middle path or reconciliation, the court has to approve our divorce now,” Nitish said.

Sushila, his wife of 17 years, too confirmed the news. “Finally, good riddance!” she said.

Legal experts say that keeping in mind the recent developments in the country, the courts might not have any other option but to grant divorce to the couple as this Narendra Modi “issue” seems to have no practical solution.

“We expect more civil cases on similar lines. In fact, we have confirmed news that people are signing business contracts where one of the clauses read – this contract will be deemed terminated with effect from the date when both the parties fail to mutually agree on Narendra Modi – employers can fire employees and houseowners can ask tenants to vacate premises if they fail to agree upon Modi,” a leading lawyer told Faking News.

“Of course, Modi is not a party to such contracts, but he will nevertheless be discussed during the disputes,” the lawyer explained.

With the ruling BJP-JD (U) alliance headed for a break-up, animals in Bihar fear RJD’s return to power and a return of the Fodder Scam – which saw billions of rupees meant for animal welfare being siphoned off by corrupt babus and netas, forcing Lalu Yadav to resign as the Chief Minister of Bihar.

Fearing repeat of such scenario, the animals, led by buffaloes, have demanded “Fodder Security Bill” to be passed in Bihar before the current government goes and Lalu Yadav returns to run away with their food.

“We chose buffaloes as they stronger, boneheaded, and have thick skin, and thus can succeed in political maneuverings,” said Bakruddin, a goat.

Bakruddin is not too optimistic about future of politics in Bihar

“They are also seen as pro-RJD,” Bakruddin added.

Bakruddin further revealed that goats like him were the most scared among all the animals in the fast changing political equations of Bihar.

“The government could fall. Many ministers and their nephews could risk losing their jobs, and this may lead to some ministers sacrificing goats to save their jobs,” Bakruddin bared his deepest fears.

“We are most confused and afraid as we are seen as secular animals,” the sacrificial scared goat told Faking News.

Goats are hoping that the buffaloes will help them get this Fodder Security Bill passed and ensure that they don’t die of hunger; though the risk of them dying due to human beings’ hunger for power remains.

“Cows too are a part of this movement and hence we hope that BJP would support Fodder Security Bill,” the goat said.

Donkeys were seen distributing pamphlets among all the animals and birds, asking them to join the movement and secure their future. Hens, ducks, horses, sheep, etc. are already on board, the protesting animals claim.

“No comments,” Bakruddin said when this reporter asked if pigs too were part of the lobby that was pushing for the Fodder Security Bill.

Taking inspiration from politicians who can’t decide between Congress and BJP, a restaurant called “Third Front” has been launched for people who can’t decide between a Tandoori chicken and Barbeque chicken.

“Every restaurant gets frustrated with customers who take hours to place their order. They keep discussing among themselves – aaj Mexican try karte hain, Thai try karein kya – and finally order Hakka noodles or Paav Bhaaji,” Nitish Patnaik, chef of newly launched Third Front told Faking News.

Logo of Third Front – promoters claim that there are two V’s visible, hence double victory assured.

“Sometimes they even ask for details of the recipe as if that’d help them decide,” the chef further revealed, “Once I tried to explain difference between cauliflower and broccoli, but it was like explaining difference between Tamil and Telugu to a Haryanvi. Just not worth it!”

“They are fundamentally confused and indecisive, and end up wasting time for everyone. It’s better if they come together at one place,” Nitish explained the rationale for Third Front, the restaurant.

The restaurant won’t have any menu at all. The customers will be just asked “veg or non-veg?” and they will be given something to eat.

“We will not let our customers feel insignificant, and hence all of them would be given ‘reserved’ tables – akin to a ‘special status’ in a normal restaurant,” disclosed Mita Banerjee, the manager of Third Front.

While the promoters of Third Front are hopeful of grand success and profitability of their venture, not many are convinced.

With an eye on losing the 2014 general elections and give Faking News another chance to target Congress led government for its incompetence and corruption, the benevolent opposition party BJP has called a meeting of top party leaders to finalize the losing strategy.

“Advani ji will announce the dates and venue of the Chintin Shivir in his blog, which will formally launch our march towards achieving a hat-trick of general election losses,” a BJP leader told Faking News.

“What’s the point of winning elections?”

Party sources confirm that after losing the 2004 elections – the reasons for which are known only to Sir Ravindra Jadeja, though many political experts claim to know the same – BJP decided to focus on developing core-competency in making Congress appear marginally better in comparison on the national level.

“Our strategy worked and we lost in 2009 too!” one of the poll strategists of the party recalled, “Despite terrorist strikes, cash for votes, and economic slowdown by the UPA-1, we managed to convince the voters not to choose us.”

“However, Congress decided to raise the bar as UPA-2. They have managed to look far worse – so much of corruption, arrogance, thoughtlessness, and general bullshittery all around. We have a big challenge to make them appear marginally better,” the strategist explained why a Chintan Shivir was needed.

The Shivir will find out innovative ways through which BJP can meet their target of third successive defeat in the general elections.

“We will have various discussions and sessions during the Shivir. Sessions such as ‘How to lose votes to Kejriwal’, ‘Has Manmohan Singh resigned yet?’, and ‘Rahul Gandhi jokes’ are being organized,” a BJP leader revealed.

“There is no discussion or session planned to elect a Prime Ministerial candidate,” the leader added, “Keeping the confusion going about the PM’s candidate is one of the key factors that we believe will help us lose the next election.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ravi-Shankar-Prasad-300x252.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-to-hold-chintan-shivir-to-find-new-ways-of-losing-another-election-3075,BJP to hold Chintan Shivir to find new ways of losing another election,,1368617423.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-launches-ad-campaign-to-increase-awareness-about-the-identity-of-indian-pm-3073,"New Delhi. After launching “Bharat Nirman” ad campaign to spread awareness about their achievements during the last 9 years, UPA is all set to launch “PM ka naam” campaign to make everyone aware about the name of Indian Prime Minister.

UPA decided to launch this campaign after a recent survey carried out by Yadav & Sons revealed that only 3 % Indians correctly identified Dr. Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister of India.

Same survey revealed that 21 % Indians named Sonia Gandhi, 17 % named Rahul Gandhi, 24 % named Rajiv Gandhi, and 33 % named Indira Gandhi when asked who India’s Prime Minister was. Balance 2 % (mostly viewers of Old Delhi TV channel) said that Nawaz Sharif had just become the Prime Minister of India.

This picture was taken after the photographer apparently said, “Prime Minister of India, please raise your hand!”

To solve this information asymmetry, UPA has come up with a of 90-seconds commercial, in which it is repeatedly stated that Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister of India. The ad is already running on the government owned NDTV Doordarshan, Faking News can confirm.

Response to the ad has been good with leading trade expert Kamaal R. Khan giving it 3 kisses.

Further, UPA is going to sponsor every dot ball during IPL playoffs and it will be called “Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Dot ball”. Leading experts believe it is a great marketing strategy as a dot ball goes well with the Prime Minister’s image. They argued that our PM does nothing, just like nothing happens on a dot ball.

Speaking to Faking News, self-proclaimed spokesperson of Congress, Sansani Jha said, “This is the great strength of Dr. Singh. He stays in the background and does all the hard work but never claims credit. That is why many people didn’t realize that he is their PM.”

He further went on to add, “This is not an ad campaign; this is more like an awareness campaign launched to benefit Indian citizens.” When asked how it will benefit the Indian citizens and from where are the funds coming for this campaign, he called us khakhi chaddi wala and walked away.

On the other hand, BJP has demanded the resignation of Dr. Manmohan Singh for failing to make people aware that he was the Prime Minister of India during his 9 year tenure as the PM of the country.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/when-rahul-gandhi-was-given-a-1000-rupee-note-by-a-chaiwallah-3069,"The man with chai ki kitli took out a thousand-rupee note from his weathered wallet. There was something about the resolve that inspired him to part away with almost a week’s earning.

For Rahul Gandhi, it was a potential life-changing moment, when Kaushal Singh, a chaiwallah, offered him his hard earned money to start a new business.

That was on April 25. The 42-year-old has since done nothing with the money he was given, has continued with the family business of politics, and has got an assurance of the post of Prime Minister whenever he is ready.

It all started when Rahul’s motorcade stopped at a traffic signal in Bhopal. “Chai kyun bechte ho? (Why are you selling tea?) Do you invest in stock market?” the Congress vice-president asked the man holding out a cup of tea.

Kaushal, who has been selling tea at traffic signals for twenty-two years now, said he went to a government school and wanted to be a doctor, but he had to give up his dreams and continue in his family business of selling tea.

Chance encounter brought some momentary hope

Kaushal’s grandmother was known as the town’s chai queen whose employees would throw salt in competitors’ brews whilst his great-grandfather was famous as the first modern chaiwallah because he used a home-made gas burner.

He still keeps their pictures at the stall. “Sometimes I think people come because of them and not me,” he recounted his story to a riveted Rahul Gandhi in jeans and kurta, with whom he could strike a chord.

Forced into the family business, his dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed and his self-esteem suffered.

“You feel low sometimes,” his eyes welled up as Rahul Gandhi offered him a tissue paper. However, the chaiwallah refused the tissue paper and instead took out a thousand-rupee note.

“Yeh rupaye le leejye. Aap kuchh naya kijiye. Family business mein kuchh nahi rakha hai (Please keep this money and start something new. There is no fun in family business),” he told Rahul.

Those who were accompanying Rahul that day said he was moved. He took out his wallet and kept the crumpled 1,000-rupee note. A happy Kaushal blessed him. “I hope to see some change,” he said.

Rahul kept his wallet back in his jeans. “I will try my best,” he told the man, “I will remember what is in my genes and what is in my jeans.”

Then the motorcade moved on.

Rahul’s mother Sonia couldn’t believe her ears when her son told him about his brief interaction with Kaushal. “Baba, you actually met a chaiwallah while moving with z-plus security and he gave you this 1,000-rupee note?” she asked.

Someone called Digvijaya Singh suggested keeping the note as a souvenir.

However, Rahul Gandhi soon realized that politics was everywhere, in his shirt, in his pant, in his kurta, in his jeans. He dropped the idea of moving away from the family business.

And then Congress won Karnataka elections. Rahul Gandhi’s vision and leadership was applauded. Kaushal Singh’s advice and thousand-rupee note were seen as a liability.

Back in Bhopal, Kaushal was summoned to local Congress office, where he went with his son, who too wanted to be a doctor and not be trapped in the family business of selling tea.

Kaushal was hoping to hear some good news and tell his son to take inspiration from the youth icon who battled against all odds and left his family business to do something new.

But he was returned the 1000-rupee note that he had given to Rahul Gandhi. No interest was paid either. Kaushal was a little confused, and so was his son.

When the father and son looked up, brain fried in confusion, they saw a giant photograph of a smiling Rahul.

A day after Congress adopted a boy in Madhya Pradesh who gave free newspaper to Rahul Gandhi, the party has adopted a man – a property dealer in Haryana – who gave free land to Robert Vadra.

“Pappu Lamba will now be the official property agent of Congress,” a Haryana Congress leader announced.

“Although the party is not officially into real-estate business, we have decided to return the favor to Lamba, who gave 3 acres of land free to Shri Vadra and helped daamaad-ji grow his business by leaps and bounds,” the leader quickly clarified.

Vadra showing the symbol of his trust

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, Robert Vadra confirmed the development and said that it was in the blood of Congress to help those who have helped the party at crucial junctures, such as Rahul Gandhi’s desire to read a newspaper.

“Of course, people like Narsimha Rao are exceptions; what is a rule without exception?” Vadra responded to a query by Faking News on why some people were not returned the favor.

He refused to comment when asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also an exception to the above rule.

Although Vadra is a “private citizen” and not an official member of the Congress party, the step is being seen in harmony with the events seen a few months back when Congress leaders were out in open supporting his allegedly murky business deals.

“After all I’m part of the family, and the party definitely helps people who help the family, if not the party,” the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi claimed.

To buttress his point, Vadra pointed to the case of National Herald – a newspaper Congress adopted because it helped Jawaharlal Nehru – and Pratibha Patil, who cooked and washed for Indira Gandhi and was later adopted as the President of India.

Meanwhile Pappu Lamba is a happy man. After being adopted, he has expressed his desire to fly to Karnataka, the latest state to be ruled by Congress, to seal some land deals for Robert Vadra.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vadra-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-adopts-property-dealer-who-gave-free-land-to-robert-vadra-3067,Congress adopts property dealer who gave free land to Robert Vadra,,1368435612.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The CBI today arrested another nephew of Railway Minister Pawn Kumar Bansal after he (the nephew) was caught red-handed accepting bribe for allegedly fixing the Railway Minister’s post.

The bribe was given by an agent of a prominent Congress leader, who is hopeful to become the next Railway Minister if and when Bansal resigns taking moral responsibility for the deeds of his nephews.

“Bansal’s nephew had promised the Congress leader that if given 90 lakhs rupees as ‘token money’, he will convince his maama (uncle) to resign from cabinet, thus vacating the berth for the interested leader,” a CBI source told Faking News.

Pawan Bansal reacts after being informed about his second nephew

“Maamashri is very fond of me. He will definitely quit once I ask him to. He never denies my requests like giving jobs to people I recommend,” Bansal’s nephew is reported to have promised the unnamed Congress leader.

The exact amount on which the deal was fixed is not confirmed, but sources say that the amount runs in 15 digits, though CAG could find a larger number.

The bribe-giving Congress leader, whose name is being kept secret for some reason, is said to be already holding a cabinet berth in the UPA government, but he was lured towards the Railway berth after he heard about the recent scam involving Rs 90 lakhs to fix a top post in the department.

“He must be in an unusually honest department, else who gets excited by 90 lakhs these days?” an expert wondered, “It could be an achievement by the government!”

Government sources too claim that the arrest of another nephew by the CBI is a shot in the arm of the UPA government as it hints at two positive possibilities – there is an honest government department and the CBI is not a caged parrot.

Meanwhile, Bansal distanced himself from his new nephew as well.

“I am a national leader; all Indians are my brothers and sisters, so their children automatically become my nephews. Linking all of them to me is absurd,” the running Railway Minister told Faking News.

“I will prove that I was not involved in this new scam by not resigning at any cost, and hope Shrimati Sonia Gandhi will support me on this issue,” Bansal added and thanked late Rajiv Gandhi for his vision of India.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Pawan_Bansal-300x237.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-bansal-nephew-arrested-trying-to-sell-railway-minister-post-3057,Another Bansal nephew arrested trying to sell Railway Minister’s post,,1368098469.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sources have informed us that Chinese soldiers have constructed a cheaper replica of Jantar-Mantar in Daulat Beg sector where these soldiers plan to stage a protest against PM Manmohan Singh. They might even go on a hunger strike, though they were seen preparing Hakka Noodles by this correspondent.

Expectedly, UPA has dismissed the demands of the Chinese soldiers. Speaking to media persons, External Affairs Minister, Mr. Salman Khurshid said, “These Chinese soldiers know that we have bought a truckload of Acne-removal cream. They are just getting agitated seeing their end. The country’s future is secure under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.”

Meanwhile, strategic expert R. Baman has said that this was just a ploy by the Chinese soldiers to mix with the locals. Mr. Baman said, “Chinese soldiers have observed that demanding Manmohan Singh’s resignation is a very Indian thing to do, and every Indian does it.

In a bid to increase the number of people rescued by them from Flood-hit Uttarakhand, politicians from Andhra Pradesh ended up taking several residents of Dehradun to Hyderabad with them. A group of 50 Dehradun residents are currently stranded in Hyderabad after being taken away by these politicians who had gone to Uttarakhand for rescue works.

This news comes right on the heels of the news of a fist fight between Congress and Telugu Desam Party’s politicians over providing assistance to pilgrims from Andhra Pradesh stranded in Uttarakhand. The wrestling match between them ended in a tie so they are now trying to beat each other in the number of people rescued by them.

Concerned politicians coming to blows over the plight of stranded citizens

Speaking to Faking News, one of the stranded people, Atul Bhandari said, “Sir, I work at the Dehradun airport. Some people came and offered me 1,000 Rs to sit inside a plane for a few minutes. They said they will just click some photos and let me go, next thing I know the plane took off and I ended up in Hyderabad.”

“On board the flight, I found out that there were several others like me who were promised 500 to 1500 Rupees to get on board the aircraft. After reaching Hyderabad, we were paraded in front of the waiting media at the airport who clicked several pictures of the ‘recued pilgrims’. The politicians left after the photo session, leaving us behind at the airport. Now, we don’t have the money to book a flight back to Dehradun and are stuck here!” Atul went on to say.

When we raised the issue with a local politician in Hyderabad, he said, “There must have been some confusion. We were rescuing every person who looked in the need of a rescue and there may have been some mix-up in one or two cases.”

When we asked whether the competition between political parties is affecting rescue work on ground, he said, “There was no competition between the political parties to take away more people from Uttarakhand. Yes there was a scuffle at the airport but you should not politicize the fight between two political parties.”

When asked whether they are making any arrangements to send these people back to Uttarakhand, the politician said, “We have already hired a charter plane to send these people back to Dehradun. We are just waiting for someone from high command to come and flag off this plane.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mins_fight.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dehradun-residents-end-up-in-hyderabad-after-the-rescue-efforts-of-andhra-politicians-3180,Dehradun residents end up in Hyderabad after the rescue efforts of Andhra politicians,,1372326475.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

There were rumors of him being in Spain, but since it was suggested by Subramanian Swamy on Twitter, there was confusion if Spain referred to a country or some code-word like TDK, CRT, PT, et al.

Rahul Gandhi is expected to come out victorious soon from his hiding

However, towards the end of the day, the Congress party clarified that Rahul Gandhi had planned an elaborate Hide-and-Seek game (also known as Luka-Chhupi in Hindi) on the occasion of his birthday, and he had won the game as no one could find where he was hiding.

“Just another achievement by Rahul Gandhi ji,” declared a spokesperson of Congress party in an exclusive interview to Faking News.

Sources confirmed that many took part in the national game and tried to find Rahul Gandhi during the day but they couldn’t spot him anywhere except in tweets by fans and haters alike.

“It is not easy to outsmart Rahul Gandhi ji,” senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, “The fact that he won against the whole country proves that he’s ready to lead the nation.”

Earlier, Rahul Gandhi was reported to have won Ludo and Snake-&-Ladders games, but those involved only two players in private settings. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has won in public.

However, BJP is not impressed.

“This is a fixed match. Congressis are playing amongst themselves. The truth is that Rahul baba is hiding because he’s afraid of NaMo,” claimed a BJP supporter on Twitter.

“I congratulate Rahul Gandhi on winning the game.

Sensing the market conditions that will see an increased demand of secular goods by Indian politicians, China has decided to manufacture skullcaps, which has been the best-selling secular product in the Indian political marketplace.

“Elections in India are near and there is already a rush among the politicians to prove themselves more secular than the others. So much so, that even LK Advani is appearing secular. In such a scenario, we expect politicians to go that extra mile to prove their secular credentials, and we want to provide that extra mile,” To Pi, a Chinese manufacturer told Faking News.

To Pi gave this expression when asked if he saw India becoming a bigger superpower than China due to its politics and policies

Hoping to grab the first mover advantage, To Pi showcased a new range of designer skullcaps that will cater to the high end secularism market under the brand name SKAPS.

“These caps are fitted with glowing LEDs, so even if there is a power failure at a function, or journalists’ camera flashes start malfunctioning, the caps will be clearly visible, thus underscoring the secular credential of the wearer,” the Chinese businessman explained the benefits of his latest product poised to flood the Indian market.

To Pi rued that manufacturers like him missed the earlier opportunity of making designer “Main Bhi Anna” caps.

“We don’t want to lose another business opportunity,” To Pi said, “We have already received an order from the Congress party of India, while we are evaluating Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s proposal for an special status exclusive partnership.”

Unconfirmed sources claim that China has already contracted laborers from Pakistan.

“No, no, not to manufacture skullcaps. China can produce those in-house. Some manufacturers were thinking of creating a fake Osama Bin Laden and that’s where Pakistani expertise will be of help; you know, a fake Osama was used by Lalu Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan during Bihar assembly elections a few years ago,” a source explained.

Apart from secular goods, Chinese manufacturers are planning to supply other political products that would be in high demand as the general elections in India get nearer; products such as flags of political parties, masks of Narendra Modi, and mini audio amplifiers playing ‘clapping’ and ‘zindabad’ sounds repetitively.

“We may not be a democratic country, but we too want to take part in the democratic process of our neighbors,” To Pi tried to give a spin to his business decision.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chinese_man.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/china-eyes-secularism-market-in-india-plans-to-manufacture-skullcaps-3156,"China eyes secularism market in India, plans to manufacture skullcaps",,1371555033.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After being denied divorce by family courts even though the couple mutually wanted to end their marriage, Nitish and Sushila have now filed a fresh petition for divorce citing their irreversible disagreement on Narendra Modi.

“Courts would always ask us to go back and try to make it work when we cited reasons like opposite lifestyles and life-goals. They will ask us to wait for a few months before taking a final decision on breaking the marriage; it was frustrating,” 41-year-old Nitish told Faking News.

However, Nitish is now confident that courts would grant him divorce as the relationship between him and his wife has reached a tipping point – they just can’t agree over Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

Critics claim that this posture suggests a direct fight between the left and the right (hands)

“There is no scope for any middle path or reconciliation, the court has to approve our divorce now,” Nitish said.

Sushila, his wife of 17 years, too confirmed the news. “Finally, good riddance!” she said.

Legal experts say that keeping in mind the recent developments in the country, the courts might not have any other option but to grant divorce to the couple as this Narendra Modi “issue” seems to have no practical solution.

“We expect more civil cases on similar lines. In fact, we have confirmed news that people are signing business contracts where one of the clauses read – this contract will be deemed terminated with effect from the date when both the parties fail to mutually agree on Narendra Modi – employers can fire employees and houseowners can ask tenants to vacate premises if they fail to agree upon Modi,” a leading lawyer told Faking News.

“Of course, Modi is not a party to such contracts, but he will nevertheless be discussed during the disputes,” the lawyer explained.

With the ruling BJP-JD (U) alliance headed for a break-up, animals in Bihar fear RJD’s return to power and a return of the Fodder Scam – which saw billions of rupees meant for animal welfare being siphoned off by corrupt babus and netas, forcing Lalu Yadav to resign as the Chief Minister of Bihar.

Fearing repeat of such scenario, the animals, led by buffaloes, have demanded “Fodder Security Bill” to be passed in Bihar before the current government goes and Lalu Yadav returns to run away with their food.

“We chose buffaloes as they stronger, boneheaded, and have thick skin, and thus can succeed in political maneuverings,” said Bakruddin, a goat.

Bakruddin is not too optimistic about future of politics in Bihar

“They are also seen as pro-RJD,” Bakruddin added.

Bakruddin further revealed that goats like him were the most scared among all the animals in the fast changing political equations of Bihar.

“The government could fall. Many ministers and their nephews could risk losing their jobs, and this may lead to some ministers sacrificing goats to save their jobs,” Bakruddin bared his deepest fears.

“We are most confused and afraid as we are seen as secular animals,” the sacrificial scared goat told Faking News.

Goats are hoping that the buffaloes will help them get this Fodder Security Bill passed and ensure that they don’t die of hunger; though the risk of them dying due to human beings’ hunger for power remains.

“Cows too are a part of this movement and hence we hope that BJP would support Fodder Security Bill,” the goat said.

Donkeys were seen distributing pamphlets among all the animals and birds, asking them to join the movement and secure their future. Hens, ducks, horses, sheep, etc. are already on board, the protesting animals claim.

“No comments,” Bakruddin said when this reporter asked if pigs too were part of the lobby that was pushing for the Fodder Security Bill.

Taking inspiration from politicians who can’t decide between Congress and BJP, a restaurant called “Third Front” has been launched for people who can’t decide between a Tandoori chicken and Barbeque chicken.

“Every restaurant gets frustrated with customers who take hours to place their order. They keep discussing among themselves – aaj Mexican try karte hain, Thai try karein kya – and finally order Hakka noodles or Paav Bhaaji,” Nitish Patnaik, chef of newly launched Third Front told Faking News.

Logo of Third Front – promoters claim that there are two V’s visible, hence double victory assured.

“Sometimes they even ask for details of the recipe as if that’d help them decide,” the chef further revealed, “Once I tried to explain difference between cauliflower and broccoli, but it was like explaining difference between Tamil and Telugu to a Haryanvi. Just not worth it!”

“They are fundamentally confused and indecisive, and end up wasting time for everyone. It’s better if they come together at one place,” Nitish explained the rationale for Third Front, the restaurant.

The restaurant won’t have any menu at all. The customers will be just asked “veg or non-veg?” and they will be given something to eat.

“We will not let our customers feel insignificant, and hence all of them would be given ‘reserved’ tables – akin to a ‘special status’ in a normal restaurant,” disclosed Mita Banerjee, the manager of Third Front.

While the promoters of Third Front are hopeful of grand success and profitability of their venture, not many are convinced.

With an eye on losing the 2014 general elections and give Faking News another chance to target Congress led government for its incompetence and corruption, the benevolent opposition party BJP has called a meeting of top party leaders to finalize the losing strategy.

“Advani ji will announce the dates and venue of the Chintin Shivir in his blog, which will formally launch our march towards achieving a hat-trick of general election losses,” a BJP leader told Faking News.

“What’s the point of winning elections?”

Party sources confirm that after losing the 2004 elections – the reasons for which are known only to Sir Ravindra Jadeja, though many political experts claim to know the same – BJP decided to focus on developing core-competency in making Congress appear marginally better in comparison on the national level.

“Our strategy worked and we lost in 2009 too!” one of the poll strategists of the party recalled, “Despite terrorist strikes, cash for votes, and economic slowdown by the UPA-1, we managed to convince the voters not to choose us.”

“However, Congress decided to raise the bar as UPA-2. They have managed to look far worse – so much of corruption, arrogance, thoughtlessness, and general bullshittery all around. We have a big challenge to make them appear marginally better,” the strategist explained why a Chintan Shivir was needed.

The Shivir will find out innovative ways through which BJP can meet their target of third successive defeat in the general elections.

“We will have various discussions and sessions during the Shivir. Sessions such as ‘How to lose votes to Kejriwal’, ‘Has Manmohan Singh resigned yet?’, and ‘Rahul Gandhi jokes’ are being organized,” a BJP leader revealed.

“There is no discussion or session planned to elect a Prime Ministerial candidate,” the leader added, “Keeping the confusion going about the PM’s candidate is one of the key factors that we believe will help us lose the next election.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ravi-Shankar-Prasad-300x252.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-to-hold-chintan-shivir-to-find-new-ways-of-losing-another-election-3075,BJP to hold Chintan Shivir to find new ways of losing another election,,1368617423.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-launches-ad-campaign-to-increase-awareness-about-the-identity-of-indian-pm-3073,"New Delhi. After launching “Bharat Nirman” ad campaign to spread awareness about their achievements during the last 9 years, UPA is all set to launch “PM ka naam” campaign to make everyone aware about the name of Indian Prime Minister.

UPA decided to launch this campaign after a recent survey carried out by Yadav & Sons revealed that only 3 % Indians correctly identified Dr. Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister of India.

Same survey revealed that 21 % Indians named Sonia Gandhi, 17 % named Rahul Gandhi, 24 % named Rajiv Gandhi, and 33 % named Indira Gandhi when asked who India’s Prime Minister was. Balance 2 % (mostly viewers of Old Delhi TV channel) said that Nawaz Sharif had just become the Prime Minister of India.

This picture was taken after the photographer apparently said, “Prime Minister of India, please raise your hand!”

To solve this information asymmetry, UPA has come up with a of 90-seconds commercial, in which it is repeatedly stated that Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister of India. The ad is already running on the government owned NDTV Doordarshan, Faking News can confirm.

Response to the ad has been good with leading trade expert Kamaal R. Khan giving it 3 kisses.

Further, UPA is going to sponsor every dot ball during IPL playoffs and it will be called “Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Dot ball”. Leading experts believe it is a great marketing strategy as a dot ball goes well with the Prime Minister’s image. They argued that our PM does nothing, just like nothing happens on a dot ball.

Speaking to Faking News, self-proclaimed spokesperson of Congress, Sansani Jha said, “This is the great strength of Dr. Singh. He stays in the background and does all the hard work but never claims credit. That is why many people didn’t realize that he is their PM.”

He further went on to add, “This is not an ad campaign; this is more like an awareness campaign launched to benefit Indian citizens.” When asked how it will benefit the Indian citizens and from where are the funds coming for this campaign, he called us khakhi chaddi wala and walked away.

On the other hand, BJP has demanded the resignation of Dr. Manmohan Singh for failing to make people aware that he was the Prime Minister of India during his 9 year tenure as the PM of the country.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/when-rahul-gandhi-was-given-a-1000-rupee-note-by-a-chaiwallah-3069,"The man with chai ki kitli took out a thousand-rupee note from his weathered wallet. There was something about the resolve that inspired him to part away with almost a week’s earning.

For Rahul Gandhi, it was a potential life-changing moment, when Kaushal Singh, a chaiwallah, offered him his hard earned money to start a new business.

That was on April 25. The 42-year-old has since done nothing with the money he was given, has continued with the family business of politics, and has got an assurance of the post of Prime Minister whenever he is ready.

It all started when Rahul’s motorcade stopped at a traffic signal in Bhopal. “Chai kyun bechte ho? (Why are you selling tea?) Do you invest in stock market?” the Congress vice-president asked the man holding out a cup of tea.

Kaushal, who has been selling tea at traffic signals for twenty-two years now, said he went to a government school and wanted to be a doctor, but he had to give up his dreams and continue in his family business of selling tea.

Chance encounter brought some momentary hope

Kaushal’s grandmother was known as the town’s chai queen whose employees would throw salt in competitors’ brews whilst his great-grandfather was famous as the first modern chaiwallah because he used a home-made gas burner.

He still keeps their pictures at the stall. “Sometimes I think people come because of them and not me,” he recounted his story to a riveted Rahul Gandhi in jeans and kurta, with whom he could strike a chord.

Forced into the family business, his dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed and his self-esteem suffered.

“You feel low sometimes,” his eyes welled up as Rahul Gandhi offered him a tissue paper. However, the chaiwallah refused the tissue paper and instead took out a thousand-rupee note.

“Yeh rupaye le leejye. Aap kuchh naya kijiye. Family business mein kuchh nahi rakha hai (Please keep this money and start something new. There is no fun in family business),” he told Rahul.

Those who were accompanying Rahul that day said he was moved. He took out his wallet and kept the crumpled 1,000-rupee note. A happy Kaushal blessed him. “I hope to see some change,” he said.

Rahul kept his wallet back in his jeans. “I will try my best,” he told the man, “I will remember what is in my genes and what is in my jeans.”

Then the motorcade moved on.

Rahul’s mother Sonia couldn’t believe her ears when her son told him about his brief interaction with Kaushal. “Baba, you actually met a chaiwallah while moving with z-plus security and he gave you this 1,000-rupee note?” she asked.

Someone called Digvijaya Singh suggested keeping the note as a souvenir.

However, Rahul Gandhi soon realized that politics was everywhere, in his shirt, in his pant, in his kurta, in his jeans. He dropped the idea of moving away from the family business.

And then Congress won Karnataka elections. Rahul Gandhi’s vision and leadership was applauded. Kaushal Singh’s advice and thousand-rupee note were seen as a liability.

Back in Bhopal, Kaushal was summoned to local Congress office, where he went with his son, who too wanted to be a doctor and not be trapped in the family business of selling tea.

Kaushal was hoping to hear some good news and tell his son to take inspiration from the youth icon who battled against all odds and left his family business to do something new.

But he was returned the 1000-rupee note that he had given to Rahul Gandhi. No interest was paid either. Kaushal was a little confused, and so was his son.

When the father and son looked up, brain fried in confusion, they saw a giant photograph of a smiling Rahul.

A day after Congress adopted a boy in Madhya Pradesh who gave free newspaper to Rahul Gandhi, the party has adopted a man – a property dealer in Haryana – who gave free land to Robert Vadra.

“Pappu Lamba will now be the official property agent of Congress,” a Haryana Congress leader announced.

“Although the party is not officially into real-estate business, we have decided to return the favor to Lamba, who gave 3 acres of land free to Shri Vadra and helped daamaad-ji grow his business by leaps and bounds,” the leader quickly clarified.

Vadra showing the symbol of his trust

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, Robert Vadra confirmed the development and said that it was in the blood of Congress to help those who have helped the party at crucial junctures, such as Rahul Gandhi’s desire to read a newspaper.

“Of course, people like Narsimha Rao are exceptions; what is a rule without exception?” Vadra responded to a query by Faking News on why some people were not returned the favor.

He refused to comment when asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also an exception to the above rule.

Although Vadra is a “private citizen” and not an official member of the Congress party, the step is being seen in harmony with the events seen a few months back when Congress leaders were out in open supporting his allegedly murky business deals.

“After all I’m part of the family, and the party definitely helps people who help the family, if not the party,” the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi claimed.

To buttress his point, Vadra pointed to the case of National Herald – a newspaper Congress adopted because it helped Jawaharlal Nehru – and Pratibha Patil, who cooked and washed for Indira Gandhi and was later adopted as the President of India.

Meanwhile Pappu Lamba is a happy man. After being adopted, he has expressed his desire to fly to Karnataka, the latest state to be ruled by Congress, to seal some land deals for Robert Vadra.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vadra-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-adopts-property-dealer-who-gave-free-land-to-robert-vadra-3067,Congress adopts property dealer who gave free land to Robert Vadra,,1368435612.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The CBI today arrested another nephew of Railway Minister Pawn Kumar Bansal after he (the nephew) was caught red-handed accepting bribe for allegedly fixing the Railway Minister’s post.

The bribe was given by an agent of a prominent Congress leader, who is hopeful to become the next Railway Minister if and when Bansal resigns taking moral responsibility for the deeds of his nephews.

“Bansal’s nephew had promised the Congress leader that if given 90 lakhs rupees as ‘token money’, he will convince his maama (uncle) to resign from cabinet, thus vacating the berth for the interested leader,” a CBI source told Faking News.

Pawan Bansal reacts after being informed about his second nephew

“Maamashri is very fond of me. He will definitely quit once I ask him to. He never denies my requests like giving jobs to people I recommend,” Bansal’s nephew is reported to have promised the unnamed Congress leader.

The exact amount on which the deal was fixed is not confirmed, but sources say that the amount runs in 15 digits, though CAG could find a larger number.

The bribe-giving Congress leader, whose name is being kept secret for some reason, is said to be already holding a cabinet berth in the UPA government, but he was lured towards the Railway berth after he heard about the recent scam involving Rs 90 lakhs to fix a top post in the department.

“He must be in an unusually honest department, else who gets excited by 90 lakhs these days?” an expert wondered, “It could be an achievement by the government!”

Government sources too claim that the arrest of another nephew by the CBI is a shot in the arm of the UPA government as it hints at two positive possibilities – there is an honest government department and the CBI is not a caged parrot.

Meanwhile, Bansal distanced himself from his new nephew as well.

“I am a national leader; all Indians are my brothers and sisters, so their children automatically become my nephews. Linking all of them to me is absurd,” the running Railway Minister told Faking News.

“I will prove that I was not involved in this new scam by not resigning at any cost, and hope Shrimati Sonia Gandhi will support me on this issue,” Bansal added and thanked late Rajiv Gandhi for his vision of India.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Pawan_Bansal-300x237.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-bansal-nephew-arrested-trying-to-sell-railway-minister-post-3057,Another Bansal nephew arrested trying to sell Railway Minister’s post,,1368098469.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sources have informed us that Chinese soldiers have constructed a cheaper replica of Jantar-Mantar in Daulat Beg sector where these soldiers plan to stage a protest against PM Manmohan Singh. They might even go on a hunger strike, though they were seen preparing Hakka Noodles by this correspondent.

Expectedly, UPA has dismissed the demands of the Chinese soldiers. Speaking to media persons, External Affairs Minister, Mr. Salman Khurshid said, “These Chinese soldiers know that we have bought a truckload of Acne-removal cream. They are just getting agitated seeing their end. The country’s future is secure under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.”

Meanwhile, strategic expert R. Baman has said that this was just a ploy by the Chinese soldiers to mix with the locals. Mr. Baman said, “Chinese soldiers have observed that demanding Manmohan Singh’s resignation is a very Indian thing to do, and every Indian does it.

In a bid to increase the number of people rescued by them from Flood-hit Uttarakhand, politicians from Andhra Pradesh ended up taking several residents of Dehradun to Hyderabad with them. A group of 50 Dehradun residents are currently stranded in Hyderabad after being taken away by these politicians who had gone to Uttarakhand for rescue works.

This news comes right on the heels of the news of a fist fight between Congress and Telugu Desam Party’s politicians over providing assistance to pilgrims from Andhra Pradesh stranded in Uttarakhand. The wrestling match between them ended in a tie so they are now trying to beat each other in the number of people rescued by them.

Concerned politicians coming to blows over the plight of stranded citizens

Speaking to Faking News, one of the stranded people, Atul Bhandari said, “Sir, I work at the Dehradun airport. Some people came and offered me 1,000 Rs to sit inside a plane for a few minutes. They said they will just click some photos and let me go, next thing I know the plane took off and I ended up in Hyderabad.”

“On board the flight, I found out that there were several others like me who were promised 500 to 1500 Rupees to get on board the aircraft. After reaching Hyderabad, we were paraded in front of the waiting media at the airport who clicked several pictures of the ‘recued pilgrims’. The politicians left after the photo session, leaving us behind at the airport. Now, we don’t have the money to book a flight back to Dehradun and are stuck here!” Atul went on to say.

When we raised the issue with a local politician in Hyderabad, he said, “There must have been some confusion. We were rescuing every person who looked in the need of a rescue and there may have been some mix-up in one or two cases.”

When we asked whether the competition between political parties is affecting rescue work on ground, he said, “There was no competition between the political parties to take away more people from Uttarakhand. Yes there was a scuffle at the airport but you should not politicize the fight between two political parties.”

When asked whether they are making any arrangements to send these people back to Uttarakhand, the politician said, “We have already hired a charter plane to send these people back to Dehradun. We are just waiting for someone from high command to come and flag off this plane.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mins_fight.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dehradun-residents-end-up-in-hyderabad-after-the-rescue-efforts-of-andhra-politicians-3180,Dehradun residents end up in Hyderabad after the rescue efforts of Andhra politicians,,1372326475.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

There were rumors of him being in Spain, but since it was suggested by Subramanian Swamy on Twitter, there was confusion if Spain referred to a country or some code-word like TDK, CRT, PT, et al.

Rahul Gandhi is expected to come out victorious soon from his hiding

However, towards the end of the day, the Congress party clarified that Rahul Gandhi had planned an elaborate Hide-and-Seek game (also known as Luka-Chhupi in Hindi) on the occasion of his birthday, and he had won the game as no one could find where he was hiding.

“Just another achievement by Rahul Gandhi ji,” declared a spokesperson of Congress party in an exclusive interview to Faking News.

Sources confirmed that many took part in the national game and tried to find Rahul Gandhi during the day but they couldn’t spot him anywhere except in tweets by fans and haters alike.

“It is not easy to outsmart Rahul Gandhi ji,” senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, “The fact that he won against the whole country proves that he’s ready to lead the nation.”

Earlier, Rahul Gandhi was reported to have won Ludo and Snake-&-Ladders games, but those involved only two players in private settings. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has won in public.

However, BJP is not impressed.

“This is a fixed match. Congressis are playing amongst themselves. The truth is that Rahul baba is hiding because he’s afraid of NaMo,” claimed a BJP supporter on Twitter.

“I congratulate Rahul Gandhi on winning the game.

Sensing the market conditions that will see an increased demand of secular goods by Indian politicians, China has decided to manufacture skullcaps, which has been the best-selling secular product in the Indian political marketplace.

“Elections in India are near and there is already a rush among the politicians to prove themselves more secular than the others. So much so, that even LK Advani is appearing secular. In such a scenario, we expect politicians to go that extra mile to prove their secular credentials, and we want to provide that extra mile,” To Pi, a Chinese manufacturer told Faking News.

To Pi gave this expression when asked if he saw India becoming a bigger superpower than China due to its politics and policies

Hoping to grab the first mover advantage, To Pi showcased a new range of designer skullcaps that will cater to the high end secularism market under the brand name SKAPS.

“These caps are fitted with glowing LEDs, so even if there is a power failure at a function, or journalists’ camera flashes start malfunctioning, the caps will be clearly visible, thus underscoring the secular credential of the wearer,” the Chinese businessman explained the benefits of his latest product poised to flood the Indian market.

To Pi rued that manufacturers like him missed the earlier opportunity of making designer “Main Bhi Anna” caps.

“We don’t want to lose another business opportunity,” To Pi said, “We have already received an order from the Congress party of India, while we are evaluating Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s proposal for an special status exclusive partnership.”

Unconfirmed sources claim that China has already contracted laborers from Pakistan.

“No, no, not to manufacture skullcaps. China can produce those in-house. Some manufacturers were thinking of creating a fake Osama Bin Laden and that’s where Pakistani expertise will be of help; you know, a fake Osama was used by Lalu Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan during Bihar assembly elections a few years ago,” a source explained.

Apart from secular goods, Chinese manufacturers are planning to supply other political products that would be in high demand as the general elections in India get nearer; products such as flags of political parties, masks of Narendra Modi, and mini audio amplifiers playing ‘clapping’ and ‘zindabad’ sounds repetitively.

“We may not be a democratic country, but we too want to take part in the democratic process of our neighbors,” To Pi tried to give a spin to his business decision.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chinese_man.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/china-eyes-secularism-market-in-india-plans-to-manufacture-skullcaps-3156,"China eyes secularism market in India, plans to manufacture skullcaps",,1371555033.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After being denied divorce by family courts even though the couple mutually wanted to end their marriage, Nitish and Sushila have now filed a fresh petition for divorce citing their irreversible disagreement on Narendra Modi.

“Courts would always ask us to go back and try to make it work when we cited reasons like opposite lifestyles and life-goals. They will ask us to wait for a few months before taking a final decision on breaking the marriage; it was frustrating,” 41-year-old Nitish told Faking News.

However, Nitish is now confident that courts would grant him divorce as the relationship between him and his wife has reached a tipping point – they just can’t agree over Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

Critics claim that this posture suggests a direct fight between the left and the right (hands)

“There is no scope for any middle path or reconciliation, the court has to approve our divorce now,” Nitish said.

Sushila, his wife of 17 years, too confirmed the news. “Finally, good riddance!” she said.

Legal experts say that keeping in mind the recent developments in the country, the courts might not have any other option but to grant divorce to the couple as this Narendra Modi “issue” seems to have no practical solution.

“We expect more civil cases on similar lines. In fact, we have confirmed news that people are signing business contracts where one of the clauses read – this contract will be deemed terminated with effect from the date when both the parties fail to mutually agree on Narendra Modi – employers can fire employees and houseowners can ask tenants to vacate premises if they fail to agree upon Modi,” a leading lawyer told Faking News.

“Of course, Modi is not a party to such contracts, but he will nevertheless be discussed during the disputes,” the lawyer explained.

With the ruling BJP-JD (U) alliance headed for a break-up, animals in Bihar fear RJD’s return to power and a return of the Fodder Scam – which saw billions of rupees meant for animal welfare being siphoned off by corrupt babus and netas, forcing Lalu Yadav to resign as the Chief Minister of Bihar.

Fearing repeat of such scenario, the animals, led by buffaloes, have demanded “Fodder Security Bill” to be passed in Bihar before the current government goes and Lalu Yadav returns to run away with their food.

“We chose buffaloes as they stronger, boneheaded, and have thick skin, and thus can succeed in political maneuverings,” said Bakruddin, a goat.

Bakruddin is not too optimistic about future of politics in Bihar

“They are also seen as pro-RJD,” Bakruddin added.

Bakruddin further revealed that goats like him were the most scared among all the animals in the fast changing political equations of Bihar.

“The government could fall. Many ministers and their nephews could risk losing their jobs, and this may lead to some ministers sacrificing goats to save their jobs,” Bakruddin bared his deepest fears.

“We are most confused and afraid as we are seen as secular animals,” the sacrificial scared goat told Faking News.

Goats are hoping that the buffaloes will help them get this Fodder Security Bill passed and ensure that they don’t die of hunger; though the risk of them dying due to human beings’ hunger for power remains.

“Cows too are a part of this movement and hence we hope that BJP would support Fodder Security Bill,” the goat said.

Donkeys were seen distributing pamphlets among all the animals and birds, asking them to join the movement and secure their future. Hens, ducks, horses, sheep, etc. are already on board, the protesting animals claim.

“No comments,” Bakruddin said when this reporter asked if pigs too were part of the lobby that was pushing for the Fodder Security Bill.

Taking inspiration from politicians who can’t decide between Congress and BJP, a restaurant called “Third Front” has been launched for people who can’t decide between a Tandoori chicken and Barbeque chicken.

“Every restaurant gets frustrated with customers who take hours to place their order. They keep discussing among themselves – aaj Mexican try karte hain, Thai try karein kya – and finally order Hakka noodles or Paav Bhaaji,” Nitish Patnaik, chef of newly launched Third Front told Faking News.

Logo of Third Front – promoters claim that there are two V’s visible, hence double victory assured.

“Sometimes they even ask for details of the recipe as if that’d help them decide,” the chef further revealed, “Once I tried to explain difference between cauliflower and broccoli, but it was like explaining difference between Tamil and Telugu to a Haryanvi. Just not worth it!”

“They are fundamentally confused and indecisive, and end up wasting time for everyone. It’s better if they come together at one place,” Nitish explained the rationale for Third Front, the restaurant.

The restaurant won’t have any menu at all. The customers will be just asked “veg or non-veg?” and they will be given something to eat.

“We will not let our customers feel insignificant, and hence all of them would be given ‘reserved’ tables – akin to a ‘special status’ in a normal restaurant,” disclosed Mita Banerjee, the manager of Third Front.

While the promoters of Third Front are hopeful of grand success and profitability of their venture, not many are convinced.

With an eye on losing the 2014 general elections and give Faking News another chance to target Congress led government for its incompetence and corruption, the benevolent opposition party BJP has called a meeting of top party leaders to finalize the losing strategy.

“Advani ji will announce the dates and venue of the Chintin Shivir in his blog, which will formally launch our march towards achieving a hat-trick of general election losses,” a BJP leader told Faking News.

“What’s the point of winning elections?”

Party sources confirm that after losing the 2004 elections – the reasons for which are known only to Sir Ravindra Jadeja, though many political experts claim to know the same – BJP decided to focus on developing core-competency in making Congress appear marginally better in comparison on the national level.

“Our strategy worked and we lost in 2009 too!” one of the poll strategists of the party recalled, “Despite terrorist strikes, cash for votes, and economic slowdown by the UPA-1, we managed to convince the voters not to choose us.”

“However, Congress decided to raise the bar as UPA-2. They have managed to look far worse – so much of corruption, arrogance, thoughtlessness, and general bullshittery all around. We have a big challenge to make them appear marginally better,” the strategist explained why a Chintan Shivir was needed.

The Shivir will find out innovative ways through which BJP can meet their target of third successive defeat in the general elections.

“We will have various discussions and sessions during the Shivir. Sessions such as ‘How to lose votes to Kejriwal’, ‘Has Manmohan Singh resigned yet?’, and ‘Rahul Gandhi jokes’ are being organized,” a BJP leader revealed.

“There is no discussion or session planned to elect a Prime Ministerial candidate,” the leader added, “Keeping the confusion going about the PM’s candidate is one of the key factors that we believe will help us lose the next election.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ravi-Shankar-Prasad-300x252.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-to-hold-chintan-shivir-to-find-new-ways-of-losing-another-election-3075,BJP to hold Chintan Shivir to find new ways of losing another election,,1368617423.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upa-launches-ad-campaign-to-increase-awareness-about-the-identity-of-indian-pm-3073,"New Delhi. After launching “Bharat Nirman” ad campaign to spread awareness about their achievements during the last 9 years, UPA is all set to launch “PM ka naam” campaign to make everyone aware about the name of Indian Prime Minister.

UPA decided to launch this campaign after a recent survey carried out by Yadav & Sons revealed that only 3 % Indians correctly identified Dr. Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister of India.

Same survey revealed that 21 % Indians named Sonia Gandhi, 17 % named Rahul Gandhi, 24 % named Rajiv Gandhi, and 33 % named Indira Gandhi when asked who India’s Prime Minister was. Balance 2 % (mostly viewers of Old Delhi TV channel) said that Nawaz Sharif had just become the Prime Minister of India.

This picture was taken after the photographer apparently said, “Prime Minister of India, please raise your hand!”

To solve this information asymmetry, UPA has come up with a of 90-seconds commercial, in which it is repeatedly stated that Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister of India. The ad is already running on the government owned NDTV Doordarshan, Faking News can confirm.

Response to the ad has been good with leading trade expert Kamaal R. Khan giving it 3 kisses.

Further, UPA is going to sponsor every dot ball during IPL playoffs and it will be called “Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Dot ball”. Leading experts believe it is a great marketing strategy as a dot ball goes well with the Prime Minister’s image. They argued that our PM does nothing, just like nothing happens on a dot ball.

Speaking to Faking News, self-proclaimed spokesperson of Congress, Sansani Jha said, “This is the great strength of Dr. Singh. He stays in the background and does all the hard work but never claims credit. That is why many people didn’t realize that he is their PM.”

He further went on to add, “This is not an ad campaign; this is more like an awareness campaign launched to benefit Indian citizens.” When asked how it will benefit the Indian citizens and from where are the funds coming for this campaign, he called us khakhi chaddi wala and walked away.

On the other hand, BJP has demanded the resignation of Dr. Manmohan Singh for failing to make people aware that he was the Prime Minister of India during his 9 year tenure as the PM of the country.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/when-rahul-gandhi-was-given-a-1000-rupee-note-by-a-chaiwallah-3069,"The man with chai ki kitli took out a thousand-rupee note from his weathered wallet. There was something about the resolve that inspired him to part away with almost a week’s earning.

For Rahul Gandhi, it was a potential life-changing moment, when Kaushal Singh, a chaiwallah, offered him his hard earned money to start a new business.

That was on April 25. The 42-year-old has since done nothing with the money he was given, has continued with the family business of politics, and has got an assurance of the post of Prime Minister whenever he is ready.

It all started when Rahul’s motorcade stopped at a traffic signal in Bhopal. “Chai kyun bechte ho? (Why are you selling tea?) Do you invest in stock market?” the Congress vice-president asked the man holding out a cup of tea.

Kaushal, who has been selling tea at traffic signals for twenty-two years now, said he went to a government school and wanted to be a doctor, but he had to give up his dreams and continue in his family business of selling tea.

Chance encounter brought some momentary hope

Kaushal’s grandmother was known as the town’s chai queen whose employees would throw salt in competitors’ brews whilst his great-grandfather was famous as the first modern chaiwallah because he used a home-made gas burner.

He still keeps their pictures at the stall. “Sometimes I think people come because of them and not me,” he recounted his story to a riveted Rahul Gandhi in jeans and kurta, with whom he could strike a chord.

Forced into the family business, his dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed and his self-esteem suffered.

“You feel low sometimes,” his eyes welled up as Rahul Gandhi offered him a tissue paper. However, the chaiwallah refused the tissue paper and instead took out a thousand-rupee note.

“Yeh rupaye le leejye. Aap kuchh naya kijiye. Family business mein kuchh nahi rakha hai (Please keep this money and start something new. There is no fun in family business),” he told Rahul.

Those who were accompanying Rahul that day said he was moved. He took out his wallet and kept the crumpled 1,000-rupee note. A happy Kaushal blessed him. “I hope to see some change,” he said.

Rahul kept his wallet back in his jeans. “I will try my best,” he told the man, “I will remember what is in my genes and what is in my jeans.”

Then the motorcade moved on.

Rahul’s mother Sonia couldn’t believe her ears when her son told him about his brief interaction with Kaushal. “Baba, you actually met a chaiwallah while moving with z-plus security and he gave you this 1,000-rupee note?” she asked.

Someone called Digvijaya Singh suggested keeping the note as a souvenir.

However, Rahul Gandhi soon realized that politics was everywhere, in his shirt, in his pant, in his kurta, in his jeans. He dropped the idea of moving away from the family business.

And then Congress won Karnataka elections. Rahul Gandhi’s vision and leadership was applauded. Kaushal Singh’s advice and thousand-rupee note were seen as a liability.

Back in Bhopal, Kaushal was summoned to local Congress office, where he went with his son, who too wanted to be a doctor and not be trapped in the family business of selling tea.

Kaushal was hoping to hear some good news and tell his son to take inspiration from the youth icon who battled against all odds and left his family business to do something new.

But he was returned the 1000-rupee note that he had given to Rahul Gandhi. No interest was paid either. Kaushal was a little confused, and so was his son.

When the father and son looked up, brain fried in confusion, they saw a giant photograph of a smiling Rahul.

A day after Congress adopted a boy in Madhya Pradesh who gave free newspaper to Rahul Gandhi, the party has adopted a man – a property dealer in Haryana – who gave free land to Robert Vadra.

“Pappu Lamba will now be the official property agent of Congress,” a Haryana Congress leader announced.

“Although the party is not officially into real-estate business, we have decided to return the favor to Lamba, who gave 3 acres of land free to Shri Vadra and helped daamaad-ji grow his business by leaps and bounds,” the leader quickly clarified.

Vadra showing the symbol of his trust

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, Robert Vadra confirmed the development and said that it was in the blood of Congress to help those who have helped the party at crucial junctures, such as Rahul Gandhi’s desire to read a newspaper.

“Of course, people like Narsimha Rao are exceptions; what is a rule without exception?” Vadra responded to a query by Faking News on why some people were not returned the favor.

He refused to comment when asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also an exception to the above rule.

Although Vadra is a “private citizen” and not an official member of the Congress party, the step is being seen in harmony with the events seen a few months back when Congress leaders were out in open supporting his allegedly murky business deals.

“After all I’m part of the family, and the party definitely helps people who help the family, if not the party,” the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi claimed.

To buttress his point, Vadra pointed to the case of National Herald – a newspaper Congress adopted because it helped Jawaharlal Nehru – and Pratibha Patil, who cooked and washed for Indira Gandhi and was later adopted as the President of India.

Meanwhile Pappu Lamba is a happy man. After being adopted, he has expressed his desire to fly to Karnataka, the latest state to be ruled by Congress, to seal some land deals for Robert Vadra.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vadra-300x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-adopts-property-dealer-who-gave-free-land-to-robert-vadra-3067,Congress adopts property dealer who gave free land to Robert Vadra,,1368435612.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The CBI today arrested another nephew of Railway Minister Pawn Kumar Bansal after he (the nephew) was caught red-handed accepting bribe for allegedly fixing the Railway Minister’s post.

The bribe was given by an agent of a prominent Congress leader, who is hopeful to become the next Railway Minister if and when Bansal resigns taking moral responsibility for the deeds of his nephews.

“Bansal’s nephew had promised the Congress leader that if given 90 lakhs rupees as ‘token money’, he will convince his maama (uncle) to resign from cabinet, thus vacating the berth for the interested leader,” a CBI source told Faking News.

Pawan Bansal reacts after being informed about his second nephew

“Maamashri is very fond of me. He will definitely quit once I ask him to. He never denies my requests like giving jobs to people I recommend,” Bansal’s nephew is reported to have promised the unnamed Congress leader.

The exact amount on which the deal was fixed is not confirmed, but sources say that the amount runs in 15 digits, though CAG could find a larger number.

The bribe-giving Congress leader, whose name is being kept secret for some reason, is said to be already holding a cabinet berth in the UPA government, but he was lured towards the Railway berth after he heard about the recent scam involving Rs 90 lakhs to fix a top post in the department.

“He must be in an unusually honest department, else who gets excited by 90 lakhs these days?” an expert wondered, “It could be an achievement by the government!”

Government sources too claim that the arrest of another nephew by the CBI is a shot in the arm of the UPA government as it hints at two positive possibilities – there is an honest government department and the CBI is not a caged parrot.

Meanwhile, Bansal distanced himself from his new nephew as well.

“I am a national leader; all Indians are my brothers and sisters, so their children automatically become my nephews. Linking all of them to me is absurd,” the running Railway Minister told Faking News.

“I will prove that I was not involved in this new scam by not resigning at any cost, and hope Shrimati Sonia Gandhi will support me on this issue,” Bansal added and thanked late Rajiv Gandhi for his vision of India.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Pawan_Bansal-300x237.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/another-bansal-nephew-arrested-trying-to-sell-railway-minister-post-3057,Another Bansal nephew arrested trying to sell Railway Minister’s post,,1368098469.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Sources have informed us that Chinese soldiers have constructed a cheaper replica of Jantar-Mantar in Daulat Beg sector where these soldiers plan to stage a protest against PM Manmohan Singh. They might even go on a hunger strike, though they were seen preparing Hakka Noodles by this correspondent.

Expectedly, UPA has dismissed the demands of the Chinese soldiers. Speaking to media persons, External Affairs Minister, Mr. Salman Khurshid said, “These Chinese soldiers know that we have bought a truckload of Acne-removal cream. They are just getting agitated seeing their end. The country’s future is secure under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.”

Meanwhile, strategic expert R. Baman has said that this was just a ploy by the Chinese soldiers to mix with the locals. Mr. Baman said, “Chinese soldiers have observed that demanding Manmohan Singh’s resignation is a very Indian thing to do, and every Indian does it. So they have also started making this demand to mix with the local population.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/manmohan_singh-300x259.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chinese-soldiers-in-ladakh-demand-manmohan-singhs-resignation-3053,Chinese soldiers in Ladakh demand Manmohan Singh’s resignation,,1367583649.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dip-in-voter-turnout-feared-due-to-mass-hangover-resulting-from-alcohol-being-distributed-4202,"New Delhi. A day before polling for Delhi assembly, intelligence agencies have issued an advance warning of expected dip in voter turnout because of possible mass hangover resulting from alcohol being distributed to buy votes.

Agencies have reportedly tipped the government about an ongoing conspiracy, where local leaders are manipulating the alcohol concentration of bottles being supplied to rival groups.

Some voters might not enter polling booths fearing a pink buffalo inside

“Whisky, Vodka, and Rum with alcohol percentage as high as 60% are being sold to political leaders, who are buying them for election campaigning,” said a person close to government, “And leaders are distributing the same bottles to buy votes, which is surely going to backfire on election day, as their voters most probably would be asleep whole day tomorrow.”

This sensational revelation has created panic among local leaders, who are now brainstorming about ways to minimize the damage.

“First we wasted money feeding them biryani and yet they left the rallies when our leader was speaking, and now it seems we have wasted the alcohol too!” a sitting MLA told Faking News, “These opposition guys have stooped too low.”

However the MLA said that they have not lost all hopes and they he had a plan B ready.

“Tonight we are going to distribute disprins and pamphlets carrying tips to avoid hangover. We will also give them free Pizzas. Carbohydrate-filled foods such as pizza and pasta are best for preventing hangovers,” the MLA displayed his knowledge.

Besides these precautionary measures, parties have also formed area specific disaster management groups to keep track of people they have distributed alcohol to. On the polling day, they will check all their target voters, and if found in a state of hangover, volunteers will show them Sajid Khan movies that are rumored to get rid of hangovers.

While all political parties are blaming each other for the conspiracy, some voters feel that this is a welcome step.

“Let people, who vote on the basis of who gives them free alcohol, keep asleep on the voting day. We will have a fair result truly representing an informed choice,” said a person who had earlier proposed installing mental detectors at polling booths to stop idiots from voting.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/matru.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dip-in-voter-turnout-feared-due-to-mass-hangover-resulting-from-alcohol-being-distributed-4202,Dip in voter turnout feared due to mass hangover resulting from alcohol being distributed,,1386071837.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

With vacant seats haunting Congress at election rallies, especially those featuring him, a distressed Rahul Gandhi finally took Congress party symbol “Hand” to famous astrologer Baba Bhokali for palm reading.

“Low turnout at rallies despite my best efforts was a clear sign that something else was wrong. Something which was beyond our control and out of the reach of money and power,” said Rahul Gandhi talking to reporters at a press conference.

Sources tell Faking News that Rahul Gandhi asked all Congress leaders if they thought he was not doing enough, but not a single leader said that there was anything wrong with Rahul Gandhi’s strategy or approach.

Rahul Gandhi showing the future

It is then, that Rahul realized that something occult was troubling the party. He looked up and saw lines in the party’s hand symbol, and this idea immediately struck his mind.

“Our party is in advantageous position due to its symbol. It was the vision of my daadi Indira Gandhi ji that gave us a symbol, which we could use to know our party’s future and solution to party related problems. No other party has such a visionary symbol,” Rahul said, which was immediately applauded by everyone present.

“Till date nobody in the Congress party had seen their party symbol from this point of view. Rahul ji too is a visionary like Nehru ji, Indira ji, Rajiv ji, and Sonia ji. Now, the world will understand why we chose Rahul Gandhi as our leader, he is an epitome of innovation,” Congress leader Rajeev Shukla couldn’t hide his excitement and ecstasy.

Following adulations and support from party leaders, the Congress Vice President is reported to have taken a high resolution printout of the party symbol to Baba Bhokali.

Party sources say that Baba Bhokali pointed out a minor Shani dosh in party’s symbol. He has asked party high command to do some modification in the ‘Hand’ and make it wear an iron ring in the middle finger to neutralize the effect of Shani.

“Our symbol has super strong wealth line, fate line, and life line. All seems to be ok. We are confident that after controlling the Shani dosh, our rallies will be much bigger than all Modi rallies put together,” party spokesperson Manish Tewari claimed.

However, sources close to Baba Bhokali have confirmed that Congress party was hiding some facts from the public.

“It has been over 33 years since Congress chose this symbol and there has been no change in the palm lines. It’s strange; it shows how resistant to change the party has become,” said one of close aides of Baba Bhokali on condition of anonymity.

“Baba also warned them of a possible derailment in Raaj Yog due to Modi dosh,” the aide added.

The aide further revealed that besides the iron ring, Baba also gave Rahul Gandhi a vashikaran mantra to chant it before starting any speech, which will help in attracting crowds from nearby areas.

Meanwhile, Digvijay Singh has once again blamed RSS for the Shani dosh spotted by Baba. “In this case, I don’t even need to produce any proof, it’s an area of their expertise and I am sure they are behind this,” he said.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rahul-palm.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/upset-with-low-turnout-at-rallies-rahul-gandhi-takes-congress-symbol-for-palm-reading-4198,Rahul Gandhi takes Congress symbol for palm reading for better future,,1386000222.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Hours after being booked under various sections of IPC by Delhi Police, BJP Leader Vijay Jolly has justified his outburst and actions of vandalizing Ex- Managing Editor of Tehelka, Shoma Chaudhury’s house and nameplate by calling his intentions genuine and heartfelt.

Faking News caught and spoke to him while he was busy scribbling some numbers and thoughts inside a public urinal.

Vijay Jolly showcasing his skills.

“Last night I was reflecting on the events gone by when suddenly my doorbell rang. I was shocked to see a crying Sushma Swaraj enter my room. She was extremely critical of what I had done in the morning and called my actions harsh. In hindsight I too felt that the choice of the color I used to paint may have been strong but certainly not the sentiments,” Jolly recounted incidents of last night.

“And yesterday while passing through Shoma’s lane, when I saw her nameplate I felt it was complete nonsense and should be painted up and thrown away, as she was trying to shield Tejpal all this while. Hence I can’t understand why I am being penalized for painting my heart out on something that was wrong and had to be condemned. Am I not entitled to paint my opinion? Maybe I could have used a light colored paint instead of black but that’s not important,” he said in retrospect.

He has now asked police to go easy on him arguing that he has already got more than his share of punishment last night by appearing on Arnab Goswami’s The Newshour.

“But I am glad Police booked me, otherwise after last night I was under the impression that there is no such thing called legal procedure in this country and I have already been sentenced by Arnab,” the BJP leader said heaving a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile Congress was extremely critical of Jolly’s actions but felt it would have been much worse a crime had he used saffron color to paint.

Before Tejpal ji is charged or convicted, it is extremely important that lumpen elements like Vijay Jolly are brought to book. They posses far more danger to the society than Secular Tejpal’s of this world,” Digvijay Singh argued.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jolly.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/vijay-jolly-says-color-of-paint-may-have-been-wrong-not-his-intentions-4182,"Vijay Jolly says color of paint may have been wrong, not his intentions",,1385716851.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-fires-digvijay-singh-for-failing-to-link-modi-with-tejpal-scandal-4174,"New Delhi. Fed up with growing incompetency of senior party leader Digvijay Singh in linking and blaming Narendra Modi with any ongoing controversial event of late, Congress High Command has decided to fire the RSS hand finder.

Sources tell Faking News that Congress leader Sonia Gandhi had been observing his performance rather scrupulously over the last few months.

“He failed to blame Modi when vegetable prices were high, he failed to blame Modi when Pakistan persisted with ceasefires, in fact, he even failed to blame Modi when Ishant went for 30 runs in an over!” a Congress source revealed Digvijay Singh’s problems.

Digvijay claimed he wasn’t enjoying slandering Modi as much of late

The final nail in the coffin was when even after a week of Tejpal controversy breaking out, the former CM of Madhya Pradesh failed to link the current CM of Gujarat CM in any way to it. His failure to squarely lay blame of the scandal on Modi and hold him responsible for it upset the high command and questions were raised over his ability, which cost him his job.

Although he did speak out yesterday, but mere his support of Tejpal and insinuating BJP behind all this was not deemed enough. Sonia Gandhi and other senior leaders felt he should have been more specific in his accusations.

Many in the party feel that Digvijay Singh is on decline now and he should retire, making way for some Jhas and Tewaris. But not all have lost hope.

“Form is temporary, class is permanent. I’m sure he will bounce back and blame Modi for something,” Congress leader Salman Khurshid hoped.

However, the party high command has made up its mind, sources say. The party is willing to give Digvijay Singh an honorable and graceful exit.

In what is being purported to be his last encounter with media and public at large, he would be asked to go to Barkha Dutt’s 9 PM show and show his class to the entire nation for one last time.

Earlier the plan was to send him to Arnab Goswami’s The Newshour, but just the way BCCI changed its itinerary from South Africa to West Indies for Sachin Tendulkar’s last series, Congress thought it would be better to field him against an opposition which echoes Digvijay’s views and where he has a chance of at least saying something.

In a press conference held at party headquarters Jantar Mantar yesterday, Aam Aadmi Party has decided to form and run a parallel govt in Delhi irrespective of whether they win the upcoming elections or not.

Arvind Kejriwal celebrating his party’s victory in alternate reality with other members.

“In our mind we are already the winners. We are acting like government already what with not paying electricity bills which ministers in power are known to do. We are also confident of bringing about a change in the system instantaneously after taking over unofficially,” shouted Kumar Vishwas to the media present in the conference.

“Since people in the party’s internal surveys have already elected Arvind Kejriwal as their CM, he would respect their decision and choice and preside over the CM’s chair,” he further shouted.

Sources confirm that AAP is already on their way to build an alternate CM office and residence next to the original one with the party funds, where Arvind Kejriwal and Co would sit and take important decisions like whom to expose, whose electricity meter to remove, how many more posters to put for women’s safety, how many more outlandish promises to make etc on a daily basis.

When Faking News pointed that forming a government despite losing would mean going against people’s voice, AAP’s political science expert Yogendra Yadav said he would do another internal survey to find out what people think about this move, “I have always believed ‘Internal Surveys’ are the real voice of people, solution to every problem in India and the only way forward.”

“And I am sure if at all we lose it will be only because those who were voting in the internal surveys, did not get time to vote in reality. Or they were stuck in traffic jams and could not reach the poll booths, which is again result of poor governance by Congress govt. Or there was booth capturing done by insecure BJP and Congress goons. So why should we suffer because of poor state and administration policies,” he further argued.

However neutral political experts in the country are not amused with the decision.

“What’s the point of wasting Tax Payer’s money on these meaningless elections? Why don’t we just scrap them and directly ask AAP to carry out few more internal surveys and predict winners of upcoming state and general elections as well?,” demanded to know one such expert from Times Now.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-give-air-tickets-to-poor-people-who-turn-up-at-rahul-gandhis-rallies-4135,"Jaipur. In a masterstroke that is aimed at attracting crowds to Rahul Gandhi rallies as well as making his promise of helping the poor dream big come true, Congress has announced a lucky draw scheme for Rahul Gandhi’s political rallies.

Under this scheme, tentatively renamed “Rahul Gandhi Hawai Yatra Yojna”, a poor person, who attends a Rahul Gandhi rally and doesn’t leave the ground before the Congress Vice President finishes his speech, will stand a chance to win a free air ticket.

“I will pick you up and put you up right up there in the sky”

“Every poor person who turns up at the rally would be given a coupon, free of cost, at the time of entering the rally, which he will have to return after filling up his personal details only after Rahul ji’s speech is over. A lucky winner will be selected afterwards,” Congress leader Rajiv Shukla explained the scheme.

“And look, we are not charging anything for the coupon, while BJP charges for Narendra Modi rallies,” Mr. Shukla quickly added.

Party claims that the scheme is not about attracting crowds as Rahul Gandhi was already very popular. The scheme is all about helping the poor dream big and fly in airplanes – something Rahul Gandhi has been repeating in his speeches.

“This will help the poor attain an escape velocity,” Rahul Gandhi suddenly appeared during the announcement and presented his views.

“My mother once again came to my room last night and cried after she was told that poor guys travel by bicycle or on foot,” Rahul revealed before he went back, leaving media persons awestruck.

The details of the free air travel are not yet known, but sources say that the participating airlines could be the government owned Indian Airlines and the poor could be taken to a free ride to Brunei – a country that has a parliament but is ruled by a royal family that has a venerated status among the people.

Some lucky winners could also be taken to Somalia to help the poor attain a confident state of mind, sources tell Faking News.

While these poor people are away, Rahul Gandhi will stay in their homes and have food there, party sources confirm.

However there are reports that after this announcement was made, many well-to-do people were seen conjuring fake evidence to get fake poverty certificates.

“Looks like yet another welfare scheme will fall victim to corruption,” said Mahesh Katju, Panchayat head of the village where Rahul is supposed to hold his first rally with free tickets on offer.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rahul-Gandhi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-to-give-air-tickets-to-poor-people-who-turn-up-at-rahul-gandhis-rallies-4135,Congress to give air tickets to poor people who turn up at Rahul Gandhi’s rallies,,1384936254.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After BJP claimed that the Government of Gujarat was snooping on a woman following requests from her father who feared for her safety, another worried father has decided to approach the Gujarat government.

Sources tell Faking News that BJP’s Prime Ministerial Candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi got a call on his personal phone around 3 AM today.

Many activists criticized Mallka for laughing when she should be dead serious and raising a hell

Modi was surprised to find that the person on the other end claimed international actress Mallika Sherawat’s daddy, who wanted a vigilant eye to be kept on her daughter.

According to sources, the Gujarat CM immediately called up his top lieutenant Amit Shah and asked him to do the needful. He also made a call to his PR agency so that this news was broken to media by his PR agency and not by Congress leaders.

When this reporter contacted Mallika’s father, he admitted to have put in that request.

“I am very worried about her. Look at the type of shows she is doing, and the lifestyle she is leading. I can’t keep an eye over her as I’ve other things to do. Fortunately we have a leader who can get such things done,” he said.

Mallika’s father rejected criticisms that he was being dictatorial. “Which law says this?” he asked, “Which section of the IPC?”

Claiming that his request was perfectly legal, he further claimed that he was already in touch with Poonam Pandey’s father, who too wanted Modi to keep an eye over his daughter.

While the Government of Gujarat is reported to have ordered dozens of CDs featuring Mallika Sherawat and started work on the “project”, Congress has termed the whole episode “shameful”.

“What about the poor girl’s (Mallika’s) privacy?” Congress leader Ms. Jayanthi Natrajan asked.

“Has Mallika complained about her privacy? Who are Congress leaders to stop her from revealing anything?” a BJP leader retorted.

While both the parties continued to fight, Mallika Sherawat was getting busy to appear during prime time TV shootings debates tonight. When this reporter called her for comments, she started singing some song for Narendra Modi.

When this reporter tried to call up the Government of Gujarat, all lines were found busy.

The speech was later torn up and thrown out by Sonia Gandhi because she didn’t want Rahul to retire, but Faking News could find the pieces and put it together to get the original draft:

An emotional Rahul Gandhi

All my trolls, settle down, let me talk or I’ll get more and more comical. The gates are locked, so no point leaving.

It is hard to believe that my life between 10 Janpath and dalit’s households in the last 10 years is coming to an end. I would like to thank all the sycophants, err people, who have helped me in my life to get here. I have a list in my hand; please forgive me if I miss out on a few surnames for lack of time.

(This was followed by Tewari Ji, Sibbal ji, Falana ji, Dhimkana ji and all that jazz.)

First, I want to thank the most important person in my life, my father, who left us in 1991. Also my grandmother, who left us in 1984. Without their vision, I wouldn’t be standing in front of you. I still repeat the words they had for you – there should be no poverty, and the poor should dream.

My mother, I don’t how she dealt with such a gifted child like me. If I’m gifted, it is all because of her. She started praying for me even before I spoke my first words and took my first step. She still prays when I take steps into a rally ground and speak.

Priyanka (sister), I don’t what do I say about her. Even last night, Priyanka called me and we were discussing my speech. She said I could have added few more daadi-mummy, but no jijaji, stories in it.

The most beautiful thing happened to me when I met Diggi Chacha in 2001. I know that being the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, there was a big career in front of him. But he decided that I should take care of aam aadmi while he will take care of the opposition, RSS, and Modi.

Thanks for all the nonsense you have said Diggi Chacha. That’s the only nonsense I don’t wish to tear and throw out. Thank you for all that you have done and it is the best partnership I have had in my life.

There have been a lot of friends who have supported me. I thought my career was over when I became insomniac, but my friends called even at 3 AM and made me believe that I could still dream.

My career began at a tender youthful teenage of 34. My mother took me to Mani Shankar Aiyer sir and that is the best thing to have happened to me. Sir would be taking me in his Mercedes all over Amethi to ensure I eat at every Dalit household in the town. On a lighter note, he has never said “well ate” to me so that I don’t get complacent.

I have campaigned with many senior politicians; thanks to everyone for changing their stance every time I changed mine. I believe that you guys will serve this country under the leadership of anyone, and not just a Gandhi.

Thanks to all the doctors, especially Dr. Manmohan Singh; without your nonchalance, I couldn’t have thrashed our own government time and again. And those innumerous watchmen on TV, especially that Jha, who would take all brickbats from likes of Arnab.

But not all media men are bad. Many have backed me despite my failures, like Rajiv Shukla ji. A heartfelt thanks you to all of you, especially all those photographers who captured my cute, dimpled pics.

In the end, I thank all the people who trolled me a lot irrespective of whether I lost elections for my party or didn’t win it. Chants of ‘Pappu, Pappu’ will continue to reverberate in my ears till I breathe my last. Thank you very much. I am sorry if I have missed out on anything.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-auto-driver-who-agreed-to-go-by-meter-declared-cm-candidate-by-congress-4074,"New Delhi. An auto driver from Mayapuri has become talk of the town after becoming the first driver in years to charge passengers as per meter.

His identity came to light after a resident of the city who decided to the board the auto suffered massive heart attack when the he told him to pay as per meter, which was not even tampered.

The news later spread like a wildfire and within minutes, auto union decided to go on a strike till elements like him are expelled from the city.

A rare incident in New Delhi brought a rare virtue to the forth

However, Congress high command has reacted rather positively to the news. In a hurriedly conducted party meet, driver’s name was considered for Delhi’s Chief Minister.

The party meet was not attended by incumbent Delhi CM and Congress leader Shiela Dixit, as she was reportedly busy disowning responsibility for the shocking incident. She claimed that she herself has been a victim of such manipulative drivers who charge as per meter.

However, sources indicate that she will have no choice but to back the auto driver as party’s CM candidate because the party high command was in favor of such a move.

“There is hardly anyone in Delhi Congress with better goodwill than Sheila Dixit. But Sheila ji is facing anti-incumbency. Both BJP and Aam Aadmi Party are trying to project people with clean image as CM candidates. It would be near impossible to find a candidate more honest than this auto driver in such a short span of time,” a Delhi Congress leader explained.

Experts say with this move, Congress has managed to kill two birds with single stone.

“Not only they have got a person who is honest, they can claim to work for the poor as the auto driver comes from a poor family,” a political expert told Faking News.

“We want every auto driver of this country to dream that he can become Chief Minister of an Indian state,” party Vice President Rahul Gandhi said declaring the driver as the party’s CM candidate for Delhi assembly polls.

“But what about the post of Prime Minister?” BJP countered Rahul Gandhi’s pitch, but BJP leader conceded that they have been flummoxed by this decision of Congress.

On the other hand, AAP is trying to convince the driver to reject Congress’ offer.

“He should look at Manmohan Singh. Currently he has the freedom to charge as per a non-faulty meter, but will he retain the same freedom after becoming Chief Minister? Meter se cheater ban jaayega,” AAP leader Kumar Vishwas claimed.

Faking News also spoke to the driver, whose name is not being disclosed to protect him from other drivers.

“Please forgive me and leave me alone. I don’t want to be part of any political party. I am not aware of the way autowalas work here. I have just moved here from Mumbai after being kicked out of the city. Now I don’t know where to go,” said the driver who hails from Bihar.

Latest reports suggest that auto drivers in Bangalore have called an emergency meeting and decided to block all entry points to the city so that this erring driver doesn’t move to Bangalore after running away from Delhi politics.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/delhi-auto.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-auto-driver-who-agreed-to-go-by-meter-declared-cm-candidate-by-congress-4074,"Delhi Auto driver, who agreed to go by meter, declared CM candidate by Congress",,1384070962.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Congress decided not to send any representatives to TV news channels discussing opinion polls, the party has made up for this loss of air time by sending Rahul Gandhi to the sets of TV game show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC).

“More people watch entertainment channels than news channels, and this will be a better way to reach out to more people and influence voters,” Congress spokesperson and I&B Minister Manish Tewari explained the logic.

Congress is confident that with this step, Rahul Gandhi would get to speak in front of audiences that will be bigger than those attracted by Narendra Modi.

“This will also help in keeping communal forces at bay,” Tewari added.

Sources tell Faking News that the episode has already been shot and will be aired next week. The amount won by Rahul Gandhi will be used to eradicate poverty, empower minorities, and buy food for Indians who have been hungry for thousands of years.

Here are the highlights of the show that you can watch on TV next week:

Amitabh Bachchan introduces Rahul Gandhi as the “angry young man” that he himself used to be till he acted in Mrityudaata. Rahul Gandhi smiles and says, “I am young, but no more angry. main ab logo mein ghussa kam karna chaahta hoon (I want to reduce anger among people now).”

Rahul further discloses that he loves Amitabh Bachchan movies, especially Mard, which helped him get deep insights into India’s freedom movement. After this Amitabh Bachchan abruptly asks him the first question:

“Who was the first Indian to travel into space? – A) Mukesh Khanna. B) Rakesh Sharma. C) Hrithik Roshan. D) Dara Singh.”

Rahul Gandhi looks confused and takes the “Phone a Friend” lifeline. He asks for Digvijay Singh. Phone is connected to Digvijay Singh, and he is reported to have said:

“RSS would like people to believe that Dara Singh as Hanumaan or Mukesh Khanna as Shaktimaan was the first person to into space, but this is all a conspiracy to keep India backward. We have to defeat these communal forces by coming up with the right answer. Rahul ji, please let everyone know, including this brand ambassador of Gujarat Amitabh Bachchan who has forgotten the favors Rajiv Gandhi ji did to him, that it was only due to Nehru ji’s vision that India has a space mission. This Narendra Modi was selling tea in those days and didn’t do anything to contribute towards space mission. Indira Gandhi ji was the Prime Minister when the first Indian could go in space. Congress helped India…”

30 seconds were over and Digvijay Singh couldn’t give the right answer to Rahul Gandhi.

“Ab aap kya karenge?” Amitabh Bachchan asks a confused Rahul Gandhi, who decides to go for audience poll. 73% of the audience voted for option B.

“Will you go with this audience?” Big B asked.

“Well, these days we don’t believe opinion polls, so I will take another lifeline,” Rahul Gandhi said and opted for 50-50. Computer removed options C and D.

“I think I will go with B, because Digvijay Uncle had said that Mukesh Khanna was an RSS agent,” Rahul Gandhi used his logical and analytical skills to come up with the right answer.

And Rahul Gandhi won the first round. Since it was a special episode, he was immediately handed over a check of 5 lakh rupees.

Another question saw an audio clip being played to Rahul Gandhi. “Meelon hum aa gaye, meelon humein jaana hai” said the audio clip and the Congress Vice President was asked to identify with which organization this clip was associated.

The options were – A) Indian Railways. B) Indian National Congress. C) Delhi Half Marathon. D) Chinese Army.

Rahul Gandhi knew the answer and claimed that the options A, C, and D were complete nonsense.

On another occasion, he termed a question itself as complete nonsense and used his fourth and last lifeline “Flip the Question” to avoid answering it.

The question was: “What is Prince called in Urdu? – A) Sultan. B) Shehzada. C) Wazeer. D) Shehenshaah.”

Sources confirm that Rahul Gandhi wins 7 crore rupees, thus being the first one on the show to achieve this feat. Congress is supposed to cite this achievement as a valid reason why he deserves to be the next Prime Minister of India.

Reportedly Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also called up on the show for “Ghar Baithe Lakhpati” question.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kbc.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-participates-in-kaun-banega-crorepati-to-attract-huge-crowds-4068,Rahul Gandhi participates in Kaun Banega Crorepati to attract huge crowds,,1383993023.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/met-warns-congress-of-cyclone-rahulin-as-pressure-builds-around-banning-opinion-polls-4041,"New Delhi. The Meteorological Department of India has warned Congress of another possible ‘Cyclone Rahulin’ and has urged Congressmen to take all precautionary measures to keep the losses at minimum.

This urgent message is being issued to alert Congress members, especially party spokespersons who are regularly going out of their home and visiting news channels to issue statements in support of ban on opinion polls.

Met officials have warned that the storm is expected to make landfall at any ongoing Congress press conference, causing extensive damage to the spokespersons present at the conference.

The lull before the last storm

Last time it was on 27th of September when Congress was hit by same Level-4 cyclone, ‘Rahulin‘, which was formed due to low pressure zone created by absence of sense within the party over the ordinance issue. Most badly affected people in that cyclone were party spokespersons.

“Our satellite system has spotted formation of similar wind and pressure pattern; this time over the banning of opinion poll issue. Congress party is lying in low sense zone, so a sudden inward spiraling winds is quite likely in next 48 hours,” meteorological department head Narayan Mishra confirmed to Faking News.

“We are expecting possible condemnation of ‘Ban on opinion polls’ with voice intensity ranging from 110 decibels (sound level at front rows of rock Concert) to 140 decibels (sound level of military jet takeoff),” added Mr. Mishra, explaining the gravity of situation, “In the worst case, it may go up to 160 decibels, which can cause instant perforation of eardrums.”

“To other parties it would not be that harmful, but for Congressmen, who start shaking even at a 60 decibel of Rahulin, it will be really tough to survive this cyclone,” he warned of the consequences.

In its official release, the met department has urged the Congressmen to stay away from media, find a safer ground, and inform their friends and family about their whereabouts.

Post this warning, Congress is reported to be on high alert and trying all possible ways to minimize the damage.

“None of the party spokespersons will be allowed to organize any press meet in next 48 hours,” said Congress leader Ajay Maken, who himself was present at the landfall site of 27th of September Cyclone Rahulin.

Meanwhile, some party workers have gathered at 10 Janpath and started praying to the ‘Cyclone Rahulin’ to propitiate the god of good things.",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rahul_Gandhi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/met-warns-congress-of-cyclone-rahulin-as-pressure-builds-around-banning-opinion-polls-4041,Met warns Congress of ‘Cyclone Rahulin’ as pressure builds around banning opinion polls,,1383641213.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/classmates-think-pappu-will-flunk-exams-pappu-wants-ban-on-opinion-polls-4035,"New Delhi. A survey involving interactions with ten classmates of Praveen Pujari, a class 9th student of Bharat Vidya Mandir, has hinted that Praveen, also known as Pappu in the school, will most probably fail in the coming term exams.

The survey was conducted by an education consulting company Creader Private Limited. Creader talked with ten students from IX-A of Bharat Vidya Mandir, and 8 of them believed that there was no way Pappu could get passing marks in any subject in the coming exams.

Pappu fears that this could be reality not because he has not studied, but because the opinion poll says so.

Based on these inputs, Creader claimed that Pappu will flunk the exams, slated to be held in first week of December.

“Since they (the classmates) have been closely observing Pappu’s performance and behavior in the class, it’s logical to assume that they have informed knowledge about Pappu’s scholastic abilities,” Dashwant Thakur, the CEO of Creader explained why the survey’s conclusion couldn’t be dismissed.

However, Pappu has rejected this “nonsense”.

“This survey is to confuse the examiners and fill them with prejudices against me, so that they give me zero marks when checking the papers,” Pappu claimed, “This is totally unscientific study, which is raising a question mark over my studies.”

Enraged with opinion poll result, Pappu has gone on a strike and stopped attending classes. He’s demanding that all future visits by Creader should be banned and no such opinion poll should be held in future again.

Pappu’s best friend Din Vijay, who has been failing in class 9th exams for three years in succession, supported Pappu’s call for a ban on such opinion polls, which were reduced to a joke in his opinion.

“Last year, they had claimed that I will get third division and will pass the exams, but I failed again. What a joke! These guys are totally unreliable,” Din Vijay told Faking News.

Some independent observers, e.g. the guy who rings bell (ghanta) in the school, have claimed that such surveys were indeed random, but Pappu’s objections were even more random.

“Why would examiners fail him if he writes the answers correctly,” the ghanta guy said, “And wait, the school has been using objective type questions that are to be answered in OMR sheets and checked by machines. There is no possibility of any bias creeping in.”

“Further, Pappu should take it as warning and wonder why his classmates think he’s such a duffer,” the ghanta guy added, “There is almost a month left. He should invest energy in studying rather than getting into such things.”",,http://www.fakingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/failed-exam.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/classmates-think-pappu-will-flunk-exams-pappu-wants-ban-on-opinion-polls-4035,"Classmates think Pappu will flunk exams, Pappu wants ban on opinion polls",,1383557370.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/son-of-congress-leader-takes-his-fathers-clean-chit-to-exam-fails-3041,"New Delhi. Clean chits are not always relieving. Sometimes they can turn out to be disastrous too. In a similar such incident, son of a prominent Congress leader took his father’s clean chit to his examination hall, mistaking it with his ‘nakal chit’ or cheat-sheet, and had to return leaving his answer-sheet as clean as the chit he had carried.

The “clean chit” was issued to the father by a central investigating agency probing serious corruption charges against him. But it got mixed up with the cheat-sheet that was being prepared by a team of senior bureaucrats to help the son with his exams.

The clean chit that didn’t help the next generation

“Senior bureaucrats help senior politicians with such household works to get promotion and plum postings, and rewards post retirement,” a government source explained.

As a result of this blunder, the usually meritorious son failed the examination. His failure was confirmed by sudden CBI raids on the rented apartment of his examiner in the wee hours of Thursday, after which he was arrested in a disproportionate assets case.

The charge framed against the examiner – a schoolmaster – is possessing a second hand scooter, affording fuel for which is quite disproportionate to what he could save from his meager salary in these times of inflation.

“The charges against him are very serious, and we suspected that he may have hidden much more inside his house,” a CBI officer told Faking News.

When confronted with questions while being shoved into the police van, the accused denied the charges against him.

“I buy the petrol for my scooter from the money I earn by giving tuitions at evenings. And what would I hide inside my home when I cannot afford to hide my greying hair with some dye, thanks to mehengaayi daayan!” lamented the schoolmaster defending himself.

The schoolmaster’s defense is reported to have been rejected by the CBI and the accused is unlikely to get a clean chit unless he agrees to pass the junior Congress leader ignoring the latter’s blank answer-sheet.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clean_chit-300x285.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/son-of-congress-leader-takes-his-fathers-clean-chit-to-exam-fails-3041,"Son of Congress leader takes his father’s “clean chit” to exam, fails",,1366396085.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/cbi-asked-to-study-history-of-nitish-kumar-3035,"New Delhi. After Bihar Chief Minister and Janta Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar gave clear indications that he could dump NDA if BJP didn’t dump Narendra Modi, Congress has started working on a plan to bring JDU into the UPA fold.

“Bihar could turn into another Uttar Pradesh if BJP-JDU coalition breaks. Lalu and Nitish would become Mulayam and Mayawati of Bihar. Lalu is already there, Nitish needs to be brought in,” a Congress party source confirmed.

Nitish Kumar gestures after CBI failed to find any case against him on day one

As a first step towards that, the party has asked the CBI to study the past of Nitish Kumar and find out a way through which he could have a future similar to Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati – two of the most trusted organs of the UPA’s life support system.

Faking News found this out after our reporter caught a senior CBI official reading the Nitish Kumar article on Wikipedia. Initially the official claimed that he was passing time on internet, but his lies were nailed when a Google Talk message popped up on the laptop screen.

“Yaar, why the hell did the court reject the petition against Nitish in the Fodder Scam last year? Now we’d have to work on weekends too!” read the message sent by someone named “Boss” on the CBI official’s contact list.

After further probing by this correspondent, the CBI official conceded that they were asked “from above” to give a “special status” to Nitish Kumar.

“Normally we go after people who could turn rogue for the UPA, but this is a special case where we are going after a person who could turn rogue for the NDA, that’s why a special status,” the official clarified.

When asked if they could find anything, the CBI official said that they were working towards it.

“It’s going to be a bit tough. Media hasn’t reported much about any misgovernance or corruption in Bihar. We did find a couple of news reports critical of his government, but soon they were replaced with headlines such as – Nitish takes a dig at Modi again – and the news reports subsequently vanished,” the CBI official shared his frustration.

“We might get in touch with Katju sir,” the official added.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nitish-kumar-262x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/cbi-asked-to-study-history-of-nitish-kumar-3035,CBI asked to study history of Nitish Kumar,,1366003322.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/high-alert-in-karnataka-as-thousands-roam-with-false-promises-2987,"Bangalore. Soon after the schedule for Karnataka Assembly elections were announced, intelligence agencies issued high alert for the entire state. However, this alert was not to warn civilians against possible terror strikes, but possible cheating by various tricksters who are suspected to get active as polling date gets nearer.

“We suspect a deluge of false promises, exaggerated claims, and fake shows of empathy in coming weeks,” a security officer revealed, “Citizens should be aware and prepare themselves for this eventuality.”

Such signs would be put across the state which will be ignored by the public

Security officials clarified that their job was not to act and stop such threats as they were part and parcel of the democratic process.

“The law of the land allows such things to happen, we can only ask people to be alert,” the official clarified.

It is the first time that such a high alert has been issued, even though experts and historians point out that such planned deception and hoax has been taking place periodically – at least once every five years.

“I think it’s too late and futile to issue this advisory and declare a state of high alert,” Ganesh Shenoy, an expert claimed, “People are now attuned to it. In fact, they look forward to it.”

Experts claim that the modus operandi of such tricksters is only not much different from the common cheats and frauds, especially those loot poor passengers in trains by making them unconscious after offering them drugged sweets.

“Like those common cheats, these tricksters get friendly with their targets and even voice concern over the ongoing loot by condemning fellow cheats. They offer sweet promises, and sometimes petty cash and liquor,” Ganesh drew the parallel.

“However there is one difference – while the common cheats vanish after the act, these special tricksters don’t do the vanishing act and instead come back again and again to rip off the unsuspecting citizens,” he added.

Experts further claim that this menace of looting through false promises will go beyond politics and elections in the coming weeks.

“IPL is coming up and some former employees of Kingfisher Airlines have threatened to stop matches of Royal Challengers Bangalore if their dues were not paid. In such a scenario, one can expect Vijay Mallya to adopt the same ticks by promising salaries, thus making the employees fall in line,” another expert explained how the high alert was relevant but futile.

When Faking News asked if the “high alert” would be of no use and might end up in yet another “intelligence failure”, experts answered in affirmative.

“Intelligence failure of the common man,” pat came the clarification.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliamentary-resolution-against-sri-lanka-will-be-a-photo-of-karunanidhi-2975,"New Delhi. Congress has found a solution to the political crisis created after DMK decided to pull out from the UPA government. The party has decided that the resolution against Sri Lanka, which will be put for adoption in the Parliament of India, will have a photo of Karunanidhi, and nothing else.

“We were struggling with what words to put in the resolution, because words like ‘genocide’ could have jeopardized our relationship with Sri Lanka, while absence of such words could have further jeopardized our relationship with DMK,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath told Faking News.

DMK has been asked to provide such powerful pictures of their party chief that can be passed as a resolution against Sri Lanka

Sources inform that Congress core group, after a two hour meeting, couldn’t finalize the wording of the resolution; let alone taking the draft resolution to alliance (of whatever is left) partners and subsequently to other political parties of India.

With time running out, the party decided to move a resolution that had no words at all in the draft.

“This is a first in any democracy across the world, and we are proud to take this step under the leadership of Madam Sonia Gandhi – a woman of strong resolve – and Dr. Manmohan Singh – a man of few words,” Kamal Nath justified the wordless resolution.

To make the resolution strong and critical of atrocities by Sri Lankan army on Tamils, a high resolution picture of Karunanidhi will be used.

“The picture would be of at least of 18 megapixels clarity, one megapixel for every DMK Lok Sabha MP,” a source claimed. After Faking News asked for further clarification, the source rejected that ‘megapixel’ was a code word for something like ‘crore rupees’.

“This should make DMK happy and we hope that they will come back to the UPA,” Kamal Nath hoped.

Since the resolution will have no words, and hence nothing to debate upon, Congress expects the Parliament to pass it after a walkout by the AIADMK and a couple of hours of disruptions by other parties where they might object to colors used in the picture.

“You know, something like proportion of colors lie saffron, green, red, blue, etc. in the picture,” Kamal Nath explained, “We are open to feedbacks and suggestions by the parties and make some amendments to the resolution accordingly.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/karunanidhi_poster-300x276.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliamentary-resolution-against-sri-lanka-will-be-a-photo-of-karunanidhi-2975,Parliamentary resolution against Sri Lanka will be a photo of Karunanidhi,,1363762146.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/smoke-from-chimney-to-signal-next-government-formation-in-delhi-2953,"New Delhi. Taking a cue from the papal election process, Congress has decided to follow the “smoke process” to signal government formation if it is invited by the President to form a coalition government after the next general elections.

“The elections are expected to throw a hung parliament, after which we will be hounded by the media for updates on government formation. Since the Radia route of communicating to media has been stopped, we have decided to take the smoke route,” Manish Tewari, Union Minister of Information & Broadcasting informed.

Making the whole process smoky transparent, Congress has announced that every party will be allotted a color – say, Blue for BSP, Red for Samajwadi party, Green for Muslim League, Yellow for NCP, etc. – and the chimney at Congress HQ quarter will emit the respective colored smoke to signal that the particular party has joined or supported the UPA-III government.

“Karunanidhi is insisting on Black color for DMK, but we are trying to convince him to choose any other color from the spectrum, as black smoke signals no decision as per the papal election process,” Tewari told Faking News, “We are sure DMK will agree, after all the whole spectrum belongs to them!”

Congratulations! You have a new government.

A microprocessor based special chimney is being imported from China to be installed at Congress HQ at Akbar Road in Delhi.

The chimney shall start emitting black smoke as soon as a hung parliament appears inevitable. This will also signal an invitation to the rest of the political parties to join the negotiations.

The moment a party gives consent to join UPA-III, the relevant colored smoke shall start coming out from the chimney. Media would be expected to start breaking news and discussing the consequences till the next color is emitted from the chimney.

Progressively, there shall be a rainbow of smoke as each party joins in. Finally, a white smoke shall indicate attainment of majority numbers and formation of the government. This will be followed by fireworks from the same chimney.

Lakhs of Congress supporters are expected to assemble outside the headquarters to watch white smoke come out of the chimney. Supporters will then start dancing and thanking Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi’s leadership.

Apprehensions were, however, expressed as to what happens when a party, particularly Mulayam Singh Yadav’s SP, after joining, changes its mind to withdraw then join again, then withdraw again to finally join again. To handle this situation high powered exhaust fans shall be installed which will diffuse the smoke of that party color indicating withdrawal.

“The media will get colorful pictures and we hope they will cover the entire event live as they cover papal elections,” Tewari hoped.

“Apart from Sonia ji, incumbent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also happy with this idea as it involves communication without having to speak any words,” he added.

Off the record, party sources confirm that with the Indian public having shown their deep disgust over horse trading by political parties, Congress aims to get the whole process covered under smoke screen through this plan.

Meanwhile, BJP is also contemplating a similar process to elect its Prime Ministerial candidate.

“Media can keep reporting ‘Blow to Modi’ until a white smoke is emitted,” BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed how their plan was better than Congress’ plan for the media.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/chimney_smoke.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/smoke-from-chimney-to-signal-next-government-formation-in-delhi-2953,"Congress to follow papal election process, white smoke from chimney to signal UPA-III",,1363254904.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After hearing Sheila Dixit say that her daughter feels unsafe in Delhi during her interview with NDTV, Delhi police has sprung into action. They have decided to set up a special force to provide security to Sheila Dixit’s daughter.

The special task force named SDPG (Sheila’s Daughter Protection Group), not to be confused with the other SDPG (Sonia’s Damaad Protection Group) will consist of the best officers of Delhi Police and will provide 24 X 7 protection to Latika Dixit Syed, Sheila Ji’s daughter. The task force comprising of 1,000 policemen will accompany Latika Dixit Syed wherever she goes.

Sheila Dixit refused to comment over the development as she talks only to a few media houses

Speaking to Faking News, a Delhi police official said, “It is a matter of great shame for us that we can’t even make the daughter of the Chief Minister feel secure. We wish Sheila Ji had told us this in private instead of embarrassing us on national TV. Now, we have taken a pledge that we won’t rest till we ensure safety and security for Latika ji.”

“Initially we thought about hiring Salman Khan as her bodyguard but he said he doesn’t have any free time as he is busy shooting films and preparing for court appearances so he can not commit to this assignment. That is when we decided to form a special task force from our own staff. List of officers hasn’t been finalized yet as we need to find 1,000 policemen who can live without hafta as we don’t expect to get any money from the Dixits. The 1,000 crore rupees earmarked under Nirbhaya fund isn’t enough for everyone to make money. Wish FM had allocated 1 Lakh crores for women safety,” he added.

When we asked the official whether devoting such a large number of officers to protect one person will lead to an even more insecure environment for women in Delhi due to the lack of police force for general public, he answered, “Delhi girls are brave-hearts and women of courage, why do they need protection? We need to protect the meek, not the courageous. Even in case something happens to them, their relatives get money, government jobs and flats in Delhi, I think they are better off unprotected.”

Meanwhile, a little surprisingly, some Delhi citizens we interviewed welcomed this move, a Delhi University student Sonia said, “Why just 1000, can’t they send every cop and his friend to protect Sheila ji and her family? At least some goons will be off the roads then and we will feel safer.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sheila-dixit.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-sheila-dixits-statement-delhi-police-to-appoint-1000-cops-to-guard-her-daughter-2931,1000 cops to guard Sheila Dixit's daughter so that she doesn't feel unsafe,,1362813280.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-cancels-dinner-with-himself-to-improve-his-image-2917,"New Delhi. Narendra Modi was to have a quiet dinner all by himself tonight, however latest reports confirm that Modi has cancelled the dinner with himself under pressure from multiple stakeholders.

“The Chief Minister of Gujarat didn’t want to be seen with Narendra Modi,” a close aide of the BJP’s most advertised Prime Ministerial candidate told Faking News, “He hopes that this step will help him gain some goodwill among those who oppose everything related to Narendra Modi.”

Modi calling Modi?

Sources say that some stakeholders in Modi’s Prime Ministerial prospects advised him to cancel his dinner with Modi, arguably the most polarizing and controversial leader of India.

They claimed that it will help improve Narendra Modi’s image and public perception, even though Narendra Modi has historically been Narendra Modi in reality.

“Reality or history doesn’t matter,” a stakeholder explained, “The same people, who accuse USA of killing millions of Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Palestine, etc., celebrate USA’s prudence and integrity when it refuses a visa to Narendra Modi.”

“Unlike USA, Narendra Modi is accused of killing thousands, not millions of Muslims, so it should be easier for Modi to improve his image,” the stakeholder claimed.

“In fact, we have reports that some University in Tel Aviv is planning to invite Narendra Modi and subsequently cancelling their invite to improve Israel’s public perception,” the stakeholder further claimed, but independent sources couldn’t verify the claim.

Sources say that BJP could advertise Narendra Modi as the only person who refused and cancelled a private dinner with Narendra Modi, thus a secular person capable of taking on Narendra Modi.

“What’s so strange in that? Doesn’t Congress oppose years of mis-governance by itself that causes just 15 paisa (out of a rupee) to reach the aam aadmi?” a BJP leader justified this approach because Congress does the same.

It’s not yet clear who has replaced Narendra Modi to have dinner with Narendra Modi. When Faking News contacted Narendra Modi to comment on Narendra Modi, he said, “All I will say is that the paneer used in dinner has been made from milk of Gujarat.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/narendra-modi-300x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-cancels-dinner-with-himself-to-improve-his-image-2917,Narendra Modi cancels dinner with himself to improve his image,,1362391006.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The Union Budget could be presented late tomorrow as the only physical copy of the budget speech has been damaged. Apparently, Rahul Gandhi made paper boats and airplanes out of some sheets from the speech printout.

“Finance Minister P Chidambaram had submitted the final and the only copy of his Budget Speech at 10 Janpath for approval by the UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi. Rahul Baba happened to visit his mummy’s place earlier today and started playing with things around. He didn’t find the remote control of the robot that Sonia Madam had gifted him, so he took out some papers from the budget speech,” a highly placed source confirmed.

The boats sank but will the economy swim and survive, experts wonder.

When asked why was there no soft copy of the budget speech even though Rajiv Gandhi brought computers to India, the source said that the Congress party has decided to go the traditional way so far as computers were concerned.

“We will come out in open only after we have gained ground and are equal to BJP in the digital and electronic world,” a Congress leader told Faking News, “We have reports that BJP won elections in Gujarat and Punjab after hacking electronic voting machines. We feared that BJP supporters could hack into our computers and steal the budget speech, so there was no soft copy.”

Meanwhile experts are trying to collect torn and soiled papers around 10 Janpath in an attempt to join them together and recreate the budget speech.

“Frankly, we think this is an exercise in futility,” said a frustrated housekeeping staff asked to find papers from every nook and corner of the house, “Even if we replace those part of the budget speech with something totally random, say a speech from the Portuguese Budget, who will get to know it? Do people really think that anyone understands Budget?”

But the government doesn’t want to take any chances, and every piece of paper is being scanned.

“We found some torn copies of Anna Hazare’s letters and CVs of various Congress leaders, but we couldn’t find the original pages of the budget speech,” a gardener at 10 Janpath claimed, “Looks like the planes made by Rahul Baba flew off really far away while the paper boats sank in the swimming pool.”

“It shows he can handle planes better than Vijay Mallya. It’s a tight slap on the faces of those who think Rahul Gandhi doesn’t have any skills,” senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh claimed, “So far as the paper boats sinking in the swimming pools are concerned, Baba Ramdev is a thug and Kejriwal is working for RSS.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/paper-boat-300x234.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/union-budget-delayed-rahul-gandhi-made-paper-boat-of-the-only-copy-2908,"Union Budget delayed, Rahul Gandhi made paper boat of the only copy",,1361980281.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/railways-to-offer-six-special-free-wi-fi-networks-2902,"New Delhi. Railways Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has announced that some select trains will see Free Wi-Fi services in the coming days. Our sources have informed us that it indeed was true, and there would be six different Wi-Fi networks that a passenger will be able to connect to.

Following are the six public networks that would be offered. A person can opt to connect to one of the networks depending upon his or her needs and the services the network would offer:

The Social Network

Rajiv Gandhi Free Wi-Fi : This will be the most generic offering and will be the one that was announced during the Rail Budget earlier today. After providing his or her credentials, a person will be taken to a ‘Terms & Conditions’ page where he will be asked to click ‘Yes’ or ‘Decline and travel without internet’ to a pledge accepting Shri Rajiv Gandhi as the person who brought laptop, computers, smartphones, etc. to India. After accepting this pledge, a person will be promised high speed internet.

Rahul Gandhi Youth Network : A connection that will pre-load pages such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, MTV Roadies, and HD wallpapers of celebrities on your browsing device. The government aims to impress the youth and reinforce the brand positioning of Rahul Gandhi as the Youth Icon of India through this connection. With an eye on the 2014 elections, this will be the default connection offered to a user.

Sibal Safe Link : A connection to this network will come with a guarantee of no arrests under the section 66A of the IT law. The only catch is that whatever you post on websites such as Twitter and Facebook, will be first sent to the office of Kapil Sibal for pre-screening and approval. Once the content is approved, you enjoy seamless online experience. This is being touted as the safest way to travel by Indian Railways.

Secured Secular Connection : If a user chooses to connect to this Wi-Fi network, he would be guaranteed a secular surfing experience. The connection would block access to content that could offend religious sensibilities, especially of the minorities e.g. IMDb page of Vishwaroopam or The Da Vinci Code. When Faking News tested this connection, Gujarat’s government’s official website was also blocked. We were told that it might be a bug, though no one confirmed it.

eNREGA – Surf & Earn : This network could allow a person to earn some money by posting content favorable to the government or the Congress party on social networking websites, especially Twitter. This is part of the 100 crore rupees budget (though being implemented through Rail Budget) that Congress party has decided to spend to fight the war online. Party believes that this step will make sure that they are on the railway right track.

Manmohan Singh Browser : These days some websites use background music or video ads that start playing as soon as the page loads.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/appraisal-discussion-between-manager-and-employee-turns-into-congress-vs-bjp-fight-2892,"Noida. In a bizarre turn of events, an appraisal discussion between an employee and his manager turned into political discussion. Both, the manager and the employee started accusing each other of playing politics. The management has not taken any action saying that they would wait and watch till 2014.

This incident happened in Noida office of SysInfo Tech Ltd, a global MNC. As the financial year end is approaching, the process of appraisal discussions kicked off last week. The Project Manager of their TechFin arm Dhananjay K. Bose sent a meeting request to Senior Program Lead ‘Jignesh Modi’.

Modi first declined the request saying that he wants the discussion to happen in the Delhi office of the company. Dhananjay could not understand the reason behind it so he resent the invite. This time Modi accused him of trying to keep him away from Delhi.

Earlier a cloth shop in Delhi had witnessed an unitentional Congress vs BJP fight

After some intervention from other colleagues, Jignesh Modi accepted the invite and updated the meeting request with a link to Google Hangout. He also shared the link with his colleagues and told them that he will expose the corrupt manager calling him names like ‘ND Tiwari’.

This pissed off the PM (Project Manager) further. This time HR Manager Kapil Singh Bal had to intervene. He managed to convince Modi to drop the Hangout idea since appraisal discussion was a strictly one-to-one discussion as per the company policy.

On the day of discussion, when D.K. Bose started with the feedback, Modi started tweeting the same using his smartphone.

Following were some of his tweets during the meeting:

Gaali session with DK today at 11 DK Bose says I dont come office at 9. Bitch Please… I always cum @ 9 not IST though. DK Bose says I dont take responsibility. I dont give a duck 2 what he thinks. Send me onsite if u want me 2 take responsibility. DK warns me not 2 use Kohli type language with US clients. How does he know? Was he tapping my call with customer? Extra hours my foot, itna paisa me itna-ich milenga #BhagDKBose This loser is denying my promotion to ProjMgr instead trying to promote that new guy Amulya Bose.#ModiForPM That Amulya Baby has not even finished induction training. #ModiForPM

D.K. Bose went on and on about telling Modi’s shortcoming for an hour and was almost sure that he has convinced Modi for a 3/5 rating when HR Kapil Singh Bal barged in the room and took away the cellphone from Modi.

Modi reacted sharply, accusing HR Kapil Singh Bal of blocking freedom of speech. D.K. Bose tried to calm him down by saying that such actions could terrorize people around. That was the last straw. Modi accused him of adopting Congress type tactics such as blocking freedom of expression and phone tapping. Modi demanded unconditional apology from DK Bose on ‘terrorize’ remark.

At the time of publishing this report, Modi was sitting on a ‘Dharna’ demanding resignation of Project Manager.

When we talked to DK Bose, he said “He has given 5/5 to himself on all the parameters, as if he is the only person doing any real work in the company. He let the servers hang during last production Go-live. He neither put additional servers nor tried putting any Firewall. A database with almost 2000 users went down and he kept watching. And what onsite he is talking about… let him first get a valid US Visa!”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/congress-BJP-300x232.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/appraisal-discussion-between-manager-and-employee-turns-into-congress-vs-bjp-fight-2892,Appraisal discussion between manager and employee turns into Congress vs BJP fight,,1361637641.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sushil-kumar-shinde-exclusive-interview-2888,"New Delhi. History was created when Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde (SKS) called Faking News (FN) to give his first interview after the Hyderabad blasts. Here is an excerpt of the interview.

Read it before it gets blocked:

Home Minister trying to read an intelligence report

FN: Thank you sir. It is an honor that you called us first!

SKS: I had no choice. All the other news channels started broadcasting my older statements from previous blasts not bothering to ask me if I had something new to say.

FN: Sad. How unfair of them!

SKS: Not really. I actually don’t have anything new to say except the three point formula.

FN: Three point formula?

SKS: Yes. 1. Foreign hand. 2. Compensation. 3. We will give a fitting reply

FN: Oh! No wonder the opposition says your response was routine.

SKS: So? Blasts are also routine in our country, so how can my response be unique every time. I am not Aamir Khan, am I?

FN: It is said you had intelligence reports that a blast would occur in Hyderabad. Why didn’t you take action?

SKS: We took action. Only that we thought it was Hyderabad the city in Pakistan. I even called my counterpart there. Don’t know why he burst into a fit of laughter though.

FN: But shouldn’t the government be alert?

SKS: Who says we aren’t. We are super alert. With all this CWG, Coalgate, Tatra truck, 2G and what not we are alert and take all precautions in …err…whatever!

FN: No, No I meant alert about blasts.

SKS: How can we? You fellows expose us left right and center. Our attention gets diverted. I blame this on the investigative media. We are so occupied ensuring we are secure from the media that we do not have time for national security.

FN: Ok forget that. Who do you think is responsible?

SKS: I told you, the media!

FN: No, I mean, responsible for the blasts?

SKS: We have left that decision to Madam.

FN: Thank you Sir, and we have left ourselves to God.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shinde-300x251.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sushil-kumar-shinde-exclusive-interview-2888,Sushil Kumar Shinde’s exclusive interview,,1361544373.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gujaratis-now-live-for-at-least-125-years-declares-narendra-modi-2884,"Gandhinagar. Following the monumental achievements on development in almost every field in Gujarat, including mobilization of Rs 1 lakh crore during Vibrant Gujarat summit, CM Narendra Modi today pleasantly shocked the nation with the revelation that Gujaratis’ life expectancy has improved to above 128 years over the last 8 years of his rule.

He said in a recent meeting that this is another achievement he will dedicate to the 6 crore Gujaratis.

When challenged that the government records don’t reflect this, Modi blamed fashion conscious girls for this skewed data. He claimed that the girls, fearing that they will become old, drop the first digit of their age till almost they become, well, very old.

So a girl, when she becomes 16, she registers herself as 6. When their mothers advise them against it, they say “Maama, main buddhi ho jaayegi”. Hence, he said, the data shows the average age less than real.

Narendra Modi declaring Gujarat number One

Modi further claimed that there was a conspiracy by Congress led central government that too caused the life expectancy figure to remain below 100.

“When I was filling up my application for the CM’s job, I discovered a great conspiracy,” he said, “There were only 2 spaces against the ‘Age’ column. So it became clear that the central government did not want any Gujarati to live for more than 99 years!”

“This shows the genocidal attitude of the Congress led UPA government,” he added.

In a related development, Mr. Subramanian Swamy quipped that while the average life expectancy of Indians have been static, that of the Italians have gone up by 8 years. According to him, this happened especially after one Mrs. Antonio Maino a.k.a Sonia Gandhi moved to India.

“I see a great Italian conspiracy to usurp all the Indians’ wealth after they die earlier than Italians. I have strong evidences for this and will present at an appropriate time,” he added.

Following the declarations by Narendra Modi, a panic meeting was convened in the Congress head-quarters today.

Digvijay Singh proposed a campaign against Modi titled “Jhooth Ka Saudagar”. He said that Modi has been cheating the country with false stories that the Gujaratis live longer only after Modi came to power.

“Modi himself is as senile as a 180 year old, so he can’t claim the credit for Gujaratis living well over 100,” Digvijay Singh came up with the logic.

Meanwhile Justice Katju too has said that Modi’s claims were baseless.

He said, “Real increase in expectancy can be claimed only when every sperm in every man’s body lives for many years. I understand that millions of sperms die within 24 hours and that’s grave injustice to the unborn. We can’t accept Modi’s claims when such things keep happening in Gujarat.”

A great debate was happening in the online world after this report was published, with both pro and anti Modi commentators citing various data and incidents to debate Gujaratis’ life-expectancy, but no one bothered to talk to any person above 100 years living in Gujarat.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/modi.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gujaratis-now-live-for-at-least-125-years-declares-narendra-modi-2884,"Gujaratis now live for at least 125 years, declares Narendra Modi",,1361380526.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Since he became popular due to his views on idiots, we sent an idiot from our team to interview him. Here are the highlights of the interview:

Faking News: Thank you for taking time out to talk to us. I’m a journalist as well as an idiot. Are you happy to meet me?

Justice Katju: You don’t need to tell me that you are a journalist as well as an idiot. They are one and the same to me.

FN: So this is not the first time you are meeting an idiot?

JK: I’ve met mostly idiots all my life, that’s how I reached the conclusion that 90% of Indians were idiots.

FN: But maybe you are an idiot magnet? You could be attracting idiots? See, I came running to interview you.

JK: Fools rush in everywhere; you don’t need to attract them.

A rare moment during the interview when Justice Katju smiled

FN: Are fools a type of idiot?

JK: All fools are idiots.

FN: So 90% Indians are fools?

JK: (irritated) You don’t know simple mathematical concepts like set and subset, which proves that you are both a fool and an idiot.

FN: Okay, maybe, but why does it bother you if someone is an idiot? I mean, if everyone were intelligent, you might not have become a judge as there would have been more intelligent people competing against you. Should you not be happy that there are idiots, who make you appear sharp in comparison?

JK: What kind of nonsense is that? Everything is not relative. Tomorrow you’d say that since there is more malnutrition in Bihar when compared to malnutrition in Gujarat, there is no malnutrition in Gujarat! What kind of stupid argument is that? You seem to be a fascist person!

FN: Err… where does Gujarat come into this? I was merely talking about RG.

JK: RG? Rahul Gandhi? I don’t comment on Gandhis senior leaders of Congress national parties. But since you have commented on Rahul Gandhi, you appear to be a Narendra Modi supporter. Not surprised that you are fascist. You must apologize now.

FN: Sir, by RG I meant Relative Grading, not Rahul Gandhi. Relative Grading, where you are deemed intelligent because others are idiots in comparison.

JK: How is that relevant to malnutrition in Gujarat or Narendra Modi’s leading an army of fascists?

FN: But we were not discussing Gujarat or Modi! We were discussing idiots!! And that’s why I came to interview you!!!

JK: No, you came to interview just because your boss told you to! You may claim that you were just following orders, but you are liable to be prosecuted if you follow illegal orders. You seem to be uneducated and have not heard about Nuremberg Trials of Nazi soldiers.

FN: Sir, you seem to have totally lost the track and focus!

JK: You have no decency or culture on how to talk to a senior person like me. You have misbehaved with me. I can’t continue with this so-called interview.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lok-sabha-adjournment-plan-for-budget-session-finalized-2859,"New Delhi. An all-party meeting held at speaker Meira Kumar’s home today finalized the plan for adjournment of the Parliament during the Budget Session. The plan has been accepted by every party and will be followed religiously by them during the session.

Representatives from all major parties, such as Congress, BJP, SP, BSP, DMK, AIADMK, JD (U), TMC, SS, SAD, etc. were present at the meeting. Congress and TMC representatives were made to sit as far away from each other as possible to make sure the meeting progressed very smoothly.

The all-party meeting saw no such unruly scenes as the honorable members were discussing a very important issue i.e. adjournment

Addressing the media after the meeting, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mr. Kamal Nath said, “During every session, there is a lot of chaos as every party shouts on the issues concerning their vote banks, and Madam Speaker struggles to decide on which issue should she adjourn the Parliament. That is why we have decided to show unity during this session and shout over only one issue a day.”

Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Ms. Sushma Swaraj, who was also present there, said, “In the spirit of democracy, we have agreed to this suggestion by the Speaker. Initially, we wanted the house to adjourn daily over Mr. Shinde, but during the meeting, we have accommodated the adjournment topics of other parties as well. Democracy hai bhai, sabko house adjourn karwaane ka haq hai.”

Lok Sabha speaker, Meira Kumar, who was smiling a bit more than usual, said, “This is such a relief. Now I know I don’t have to bother with baith jaiye to try and pacify the members as adjournment is pre-decided. I have to wait for them to start shouting, and within 5 minutes adjourn over the issue of that particular day.”

Faking News has managed to get details of the adjournment schedule. This is an FN exclusive, not TV news type of exclusive, but an actual exclusive! The detailed adjournment schedule is as follows:

Working Day Excuse Reason for adjournment Monday Home Minister’s remarks linking BJP/RSS to terrorism Tuesday Helicopter scam Wednesday Telangana Thursday Demand for reservation in any one bill of the members’ choice Friday Hafiz Saeed, Yasin Malik, and others

After going through the schedule, we asked Mr. Kamal Nath what happened to the Lokpal bill, supposed to pass during the Budget Session as per Sonia Ji, he replied, “What!? Pass it now and remain unprepared for the Monsoon Session!?”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/parliament-300x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/lok-sabha-adjournment-plan-for-budget-session-finalized-2859,Lok Sabha adjournment plan for Budget Session finalized,,1360771615.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-to-organize-vibrant-bjp-summit-2847,"Gandhinagar. After widely assumed success of various “Vibrant Gujarat” summits organized by Gujarat government under Narendra Modi, the Gujarat Chief Minister is planning to host “Vibrant BJP” summit to showcase BJP as a growing and prosperous political party.

“Most critics claim that Modi has well marketed the ‘Gujarat model of development’ through such summits. Now the next thing that is needed is to market BJP among the voters ahead of the 2014 elections; that’s why this new summit,” Sujit Patel, a close aide of the Gujarat CM told Faking News.

Narendra Modi making a pitch

However, those invited to the summit are not the common voters, but political leaders.

“The first step towards making BJP a vibrant party is to widen its appeal among potential allies,” Modi’s aide informed, “We have extended invitations to everyone, including leaders from Congress and UPA allies. They can come in person or send delegations, depending upon how they want the public to perceive their relationship with NaMo.”

The summit will run for a week, and the host Narendra Modi will use this opportunity to prove why BJP was a great destination for “investment” by political parties and leaders, as it was set to form the next government at center.

“Well, there is no empirical data to prove that BJP was set to form the next government, but then we can always put something like data on the PowerPoint slides to drive home a point,” claimed Sujit, an MBA by education.

Sources inform that BJP President Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the summit, but all the events will be moderated and supervised by the Gujarat CM.

“Yes, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has also been invited,” Modi’s aide responded when asked, “We will get to know whether he has accepted or declined the invitation by reading tomorrow’s newspapers.”

Unconfirmed sources say that Sonia Gandhi received three copies of invitations – one meant for her, and other two forwarded by Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. She trashed all the three as the subject line read “Are you ready to meet the next Prime Minister of India?”

When asked why was the summit named “Vibrant BJP” even though it appeared more like aimed at projecting Narendra Modi as the growing and prosperous party rather than the BJP, the Modi aide said, “Yes, we could have called it ‘Vibrant Modi’, and that’s what it is, but then we thought we should let the critics say the same.”

“It has more impact that way,” he added.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-tulika-in-gujarat-it-is-mallika-in-haryana-for-congress-2845,"Rohtak. Mallika Sherawat will lead Congress campaign in Haryana during the 2014 assembly elections, Haryana Congress chief Mr. Phool Chand Mullana announced today.

She will be the face of the campaign and there will be 50 commercials per day featuring Mallika Sherawat every day on every channel for the next 1 year.

Mallika Sherawat (born Reema Lamba) is a Bollywood actress from Rohtak in Haryana. She has claimed to be a Hollywood actress as well, but Faking News didn’t find any evidence of that except the term ‘LA‘ (Los Angeles) in her Twitter handle.

A motivational poster by Congress for upcoming Haryana elections

Flanked by Chief Minister Mr. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Mr. Mullana said, “After the tremendous success of ‘Tulika for Gujarat’ campaign that saw Congress score a huge moral victory in Gujarat elections, the party has decided to follow the same model in every state. This was discussed in detail during the Chintan Shivir in Jaipur, and since then we were looking for an ideal candidate to lead our campaign in Haryana. Finally we have settled for Mallika Sherawat.”

Explaining the decision to appoint Ms. Sherawat, CM Hooda said, “We had contemplated several candidates like Poonam Pandey and Sherlyn Chopra, but in the end we decided to go with a local girl, Mallika Sherawat. She is a Jat so she will help us in the Jat belt. At the same time, she is very popular among the youth of our state as well. In a recent survey, we found her photo in almost every room of every boys hostel in Haryana, apparently she inspires all of them. We will portray her as an empowered woman to attract the female voters too.”

“Our government is currently under attack by communal forces who talk about land grab by our government in Haryana so we need to start our campaign early and ensure not much damage is done to our image. That is why we have decided to hire Mallika well in advance and start our campaign,” Mr. Hooda added.

When asked about Mallika’s response to this offer, Mr. Mullana said, “Mallika is very excited about this assignment. Right now, she isn’t doing much except following people on Twitter so she has plenty of time on her hands. Her upcoming film Dirty Politics has already trained her in the art of politics so we won’t have to waste any time teaching her the intricacies of politics. She doesn’t mind being part of a project destined to fail either, as evident from her signing KLPD, the movie.”

Some of the slogans from Gujarat will be used too after editing them to make them appealing for Haryanvis. Instead of “Disha badlo, Dasha badlo”, it will be “Disha wahi, Dasha wahi. Gulaabi bhains pee kar vote karo, Hota usse nasha sahi!”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mallika_Sherawat-272x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-tulika-in-gujarat-it-is-mallika-in-haryana-for-congress-2845,"After Tulika in Gujarat, it is Mallika in Haryana for Congress",,1360332295.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/computers-in-india-to-carry-made-in-china-brought-in-by-congress-label-2843,"New Delhi. To reinforce the claim that computers were brought to India by Rajiv Gandhi, the government has asked all computer manufacturers to put “Brought in by Congress” label on their products selling in India.

Since India has failed to become a manufacturing hub and most of the computers/laptops among other things are made in China these days, the effective label will read “Made in China. Now in India. Brought in by Congress.”

Old story with a new label

“We are trying to educate our citizens who are being misinformed by stuff they read it online, ironically through computers,” Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said.

“The young generation is being told half-truths,” Mr. Sharma claimed, “They think Charles Babbage designed a computer and Bill Gates sold it, but they have no idea about crucial intervention by Shri Rajiv Gandhi and Congress.”

When asked what special efforts did Congress put in to bring in a technology that was already to set to enter global markets including India, the Union Minister expressed shock and disgust at the question put by Faking News.

“Do you have no sense of patriotism left inside you? How can you even say such a silly thing?” Mr. Sharma started off with a rhetorical counter question.

“Nothing can enter or leave India without special interventions by Congress, be it Ottavio Quattrocchi or Warren Anderson, ” he explained after regaining his composure.

“And don’t assume that just because an idea/technology is popular and convincing, it is set to enter India. Democracy was also popular and convincing, but we kicked it out in 1975-77! We decide what is good for the masses, and accordingly we let it enter India e.g. corruption ,” he clarified.

“We should be rightfully credited for the good work we have done,” Mr. Sharma justified the new government order for the computer manufacturers.

Meanwhile unconfirmed sources suggest that espresso chains like Barista, Café Coffee Day, Starbucks, etc. have been approached by Narendra Modi with a proposal to put a banner in the outlets reading “Milk used in our coffee comes from Gujarat.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/barcode-300x265.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/computers-in-india-to-carry-made-in-china-brought-in-by-congress-label-2843,"Computers in India to carry “Made in China, Brought in by Congress” label",,1360319927.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/everything-modi-said-at-srcc-is-copied-from-us-congress-2839,"New Delhi. Congress has claimed that not only the statements dealing with the “youth” and “computer” factors – pioneered by Rahul Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi respectively – but almost everything said by Narendra Modi at SRCC in Delhi University was borrowed from Congress.

In fact, sources tell Faking news that 10 Janpath, the residence of the Congress President Ms. Sonia Gandhi, was abuzz with unusual bonhomie and loud cheers contrary to the tremors expected from students’ response to Narendra Modi’s speech at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC).

A Congress leader went on to claim that Narendra Modi even copied the way Rahul Gandhi waves his hand to a crowd of cheering party workers

The Congress think tank had just presented before Sonia Ji, a rebuttal of all the high-flying and deep-sounding phrases used by Modi in his speech, where it has been claimed that all those terms either originally belong to Congress or are meaningless.

Here are the highlights:

P2G2: Congress has been an old practitioner of P2G2 i.e. “Progeny to Progeny, Gandhi to Gandhi” dictum of passing on the political power to the ‘Youth Icon’ of the country.

Speed, Skill & Scale: This model of looting the exchequer has already been perfected under the UPA rule. The Congress spokesperson thundered, “If any party can beat our scam record, either in Speed, Skill, or Scale, I will take sanyaas from politics!”

Fiber to Forex: Modi’s pitch for establishing value chain for the cotton growers came in for hearty laughter, especially from the well-travelled Congressmen. “Which international label uses cotton? Armani? Prada? I have cupboards full of these at home and none of it is made of cotton! Forex, my foot!”

Agriculture Production: All the Congress ruled states have already achieved peak agricultural productivity, so where is the question of a double-digit growth? Unless, of course, Center’s push for GM crops is supported by the Opposition and the activist vermin.

Water Table Rising: What does Gujarat want, annual floods like Assam and Bihar? People of Gujarat need to wake up while there’s still time. Imagine the deadly saline of Kutch flowing through the streets of Ahmedabad and Surat!

The Glass is Full: Once again, Narendra Modi had tried to steal an idea Congress and UPA had long perfected. While Modi said that the glass was half full of water and half full of air, Congress has always been fording ahead with its plan to loot the country dry and tell the people of India that the glass was still full!

Ms. Sonia Gandhi is reported to be delighted at the job well done. She has asked the Information & Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewary to issue the above rebuttal as an immediate press release titled “Blow to Modi.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/namo-300x244.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/everything-modi-said-at-srcc-is-copied-from-us-congress-2839,Everything Modi said at SRCC is copied from us: Congress,,1360228919.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-leader-wants-salman-khan-to-be-partys-pm-candidate-2825,"Mumbai. The race for becoming the Prime Ministerial candidate of the BJP/NDA has become even more competitive and confusing. After Yashwant Sinha recommended Narendra Modi and Shiv Sena preferred Sushma Swaraj, a little-known leader of the party has recommended the name of Salman Khan.

“We have learnt all the bad things from Congress, such as corruption, foot-in-mouth statements from our leaders, confusion on economic policies, etc. It’s time we learn some good things from them too,” the BJP leader argued.

“We should make a member from the minority community our Prime Ministerial candidate,” the leader, who didn’t want to be named, suggested, “Sikhs are to Congress what Muslims are to BJP. If Congress fought last elections under a Sikh, we should go for a Muslim, and my choice is Salman Khan.”

Salman had earlier campaigned for a few BJP leaders, such as Vinod Khanna.

The choice of Salman Khan was backed by factors like widespread appeal despite being a polarizing figure, acceptance among the youth (especially among those who have no idea about politics and who tend to vote Congress consequently), acceptance among the core Hindu groups, and someone who matches Rahul Gandhi – the putative Prime Ministerial candidate of Congress for the next general elections.

“Salman is over 40, young, good-looking, and unmarried like Rahul Gandhi, and his movies have as much logic as some of the statements by Rahul,” the BJP leader told Faking News, “Shiv Sena too supports Salman, while JD-U will not oppose a Muslim candidate; so he’s good for the alliance too!”

The leader further pointed out that Salman holds Ganpati Puja at his home, which could convince Hindu groups of his acceptability, while he could get much more Muslim votes than any current BJP leader, including the Muslim ones, can ever manage.

The leader further argued that just like Congress manages to get votes in the Sikh majority state of Punjab, BJP will do better in the Muslim majority state of Jammu & Kashmir after Salman is made the party’s Prime Ministerial candidate.

“If Salman Khan ends up marrying Katrina Kaif, who is half Kashmiri, I don’t see any reason why BJP can’t win elections in Kashmir,” the leader came up with the logic.

When asked about the various criminal cases, such as hit-and-run and illegal poaching of Black Buck, which Salman faces, the leader said that the party could use them as strings to control the Bollywood superstar if he refused to toe the party-line.

“We can transfer these cases to the CBI, which is the best tool to control any political leader having independent ambitions,” he suggested.

When contacted for comments, Salman Khan said, “kya bakwaas hai yaar! I’m not the Khan whose movies have flopped recently, so no plans to enter politics.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/salman-300x251.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-leader-wants-salman-khan-to-be-partys-pm-candidate-2825,BJP leader wants Salman Khan to be party's PM candidate,,1359457282.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/constitution-to-be-changed-to-allow-minors-to-become-corrupt-ministers-2823,"New Delhi. After the sixth accused in the infamous Delhi gangrape case was declared a “minor” on the basis of school certificate, politicians in India are thinking of using the juvenile delinquency laws to their own advantage.

“He (the rape accused) will be a free man just after three years, even though he’s accused of acting in the most ghastly and beastly manner,” a politician marveled at the benefits of being a minor.

“Imagine, if this is what he gets for raping and killing a girl, what he would have got for carrying out corrupt activities like taking bribe or undermining policies,” the politician added,“ Man, one can be free in just a few days, even if there is clinching proof of corruption!”

Corrupt politicians are now hoping to hide behind another law

Sources tell Faking News that politicians are thinking of amending the constitution that disallows minors from voting for contesting elections. They see this as an excellent opportunity where they can get a person under 18 years as a proxy minister, who can be the front to carry out all the corrupt activities.

“They are thinking of allowing those over 13 years i.e. those eligible to join Facebook, to contest elections and become MPs, and finally become ministers in the government,” a source revealed, “Finally they won’t have to worry about their corrupt practices being caught.”

In fact, some of them are planning to declare themselves minor by producing fake school certificates; somewhat on lines of Raja Bhaiyya of Uttar Pradesh, who produced an affidavit that suggested that he had won his first assembly elections when he was just 19, whereas the minimum age-limit as per the Indian constitution to fight elections is 25 years.

Sources suggest that while there is near unanimity among all politicians to allow minors to contest elections, there are sharp divisions between Congress and BJP over allowing minors to vote.

“While Congress claims to have the youth icon Rahul Gandhi, they are not sure if the Facebook generation will vote for them as the social media is dominated by anti-Congress elements,” a source revealed, “They want to wait till they spend the 100 crores rupees on social media effectively.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/juvenile-300x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/constitution-to-be-changed-to-allow-minors-to-become-corrupt-ministers-2823,Constitution to be changed to allow minors to become corrupt ministers,,1359393792.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/aman-ki-asha-between-congress-and-bjp-proposed-2813,"New Delhi. After Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde accused BJP of running terror camps in cahoots with RSS – a remark that was backed by many Congress leaders such as Digvijay Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyar –many media organizations have been thinking of launching a “peace campaign” between Congress and BJP on lines of “Aman Ki Asha” between India and Pakistan.

“Brokering peace between India and Pakistan is a passé now,” a senior marketing manager at one of India’s leading newspapers told Faking News, “In fact, there is no room to do anything innovative as there are hardly any problems to be solved, except Kashmir that no one, except Hafiz Saeed, wants to talk about.”

“Pakistani artists get visa more easily than Indians can get their passports renewed. Cricket matches between the two nations are back. Indian and Pakistani people interact freely on Twitter and Facebook. It’s all so good! Frankly a peace campaign is not needed!” the manager explained.

The manager claimed that a potential peace campaign between Congress and BJP was a better “business idea” than a peace campaign between India and Pakistan.

“The ‘Foreign Hand’, which de-facto meant ‘Pakistani Hand’, has been replaced by ‘RSS Hand’ for some years now – I guess for as many years ever since Google search volumes for ‘Digvijay Singh’ went up – and it means that the new enemy is BJP/RSS and not Pakistan,” the manager further explained.

Many other marketing managers and advertising professionals agreed that a peace campaign between Congress and BJP was really a good idea.

“We are already working on a few ideas to be implemented as part of this campaign,” revealed a copywriter with an advertising firm.

Sources inform that advertising and event management firms were already drawing parallels between India-Pakistan peace campaigns and a theoretical Congress-BJP one, and trying to come up with fresh ideas.

Unconfirmed reports suggest that both the parties were told to come up with a list of in-house artists who could represent either sides at events, but the parties could come up with names of a few journalists only, who are not considered as “artists” by general public.

As a result, professionals are trying to come up with new ideas that they could suggest to both the parties.

“Cross-cultural exchanges are perhaps meaningless,” an event manager opined, “Both parties have almost the same culture and there won’t be much fun. Unless of course they throw seminar chairs at each other, which will make wonderful TV event!”

“We don’t need people-to-people contact initiatives as well because Congress and BJP supporters are not geographically separated as India and Pakistan,” he tried to find new ideas, “Guess we can make their corrupt leaders, separated geographically by being locked up in different jails, meet each other. That could be a good starting point.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nitin-gadkari-admits-to-doping-to-win-bjp-presidents-race-2805,"New Delhi. It’s India’s own Lance Armstrong moment. BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, in an exclusive interview to Faking News, has confessed that he resorted to doping to win the race to become party president for the second time.

“I took a few performance enhancing drugs earlier today,” a candid Gadkari confided to this reporter who dressed up like Oprah Winfrey to extract the truth.

Gadkari said that he had grown nervous after realizing that his second term as BJP President might not be as smooth as he had imagined, and hence took this step in desperation.

An emotional Not-so-strong Gadkari spilled the beans a la Lance Armstrong

“What could I have done?” a tearful Gadkari argued, “My surname starts with ‘G’ and ends with an ‘I’, and it has even a ‘D’ in between, but it’s not Gandhi! Being elected to the top post doesn’t come naturally to me due to that. Not my fault!”

“In absence of such natural inborn skills, I had to go for some artificial and external help,” the incumbent BJP President explained the extreme circumstances under which he took to doping.

Reports suggest that Gadkari had taken 5 milliliter of RSScitazone, a performance enhancing drug, mixed with 5 liters of Orange juice, which he takes daily in breakfast. He did it after media reports suggested that Mahesh Jethmalani or Yashwant Sinha could contest elections against him.

However, Nitin Gadkari maintains that whatever he did might have been a bit improper, but not illegal, just like the accounting practices in Purti Group companies.

“RSScitazone is a performance enhancing drug, but it’s not on the list of banned drugs by the Indian Medical Association, Indian Olympics Association, or the Election Commission of India,” Gadkari claimed.

Experts agree that Gadkari is right on technical grounds and hence he can’t be disqualified from the BJP President’s race.

“Unless the government, incidentally led by Congress party, bans RSScitazone, Nitin Gadkari is well within his right to take this drug,” a television expert pointed out.

“So what if RSScitazone is not banned,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh jumped in to offer a comment, “I have clinching proof, such as phone records and emails exchanged with Hafiz Saeed Mahesh Bhatt Sahib, which prove that terrorists take RSScitazone shots before carrying out attacks.”

Latest reports suggest that Gadkari has decided to withdraw from the race following his confession to Faking News. It’s not yet clear if he took the same drug to win the race last time.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gadkari.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nitin-gadkari-admits-to-doping-to-win-bjp-presidents-race-2805,Nitin Gadkari admits to doping to win BJP president’s race,,1358871220.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-supporters-start-petition-urging-deepika-padukone-to-date-rahul-gandhi-2801,"New Delhi. Frustrated by the inability of their own party leaders, some BJP supporters have decided to take matters into their own hands to ensure a BJP victory in the 2014 general elections. A group of these supporters has started an online petition urging Bollywood star Deepika Padukone to date Rahul Gandhi, the preordained Prime Ministerial candidate of the ruling UPA alliance.

Explaining the rationale behind this petition, Mr. Rahul Gupta the representative of the group said, “We were celebrating couple of days back when we heard that Rahul Gandhi will lead UPA campaign during 2014 elections but BJP is trying hard to level the playing field by electing Nitin Gadkari as the party president once again. We need something to gain the edge again and looking at Deepika ji’s track record, she may be the ideal person to pull down Rahul Gandhi, even below Nitin Gadkari.”

He added, “When talented people like Yuvraj Singh and Ranbir Kapoor started struggling while dating her then what chance does Rahul ji have? Rahul ji is more in league with Siddharth Mallaya and look what happened to not just him but his father too. We hope for a similar bankruptcy for Mrs. Gandhi after her son dates Deepika.”

Deepika is reported to be a bit taller than Rahul, but BJP supporters say that it won’t be a problem as Rahul Gandhi is known to like bigger roles.

“Rahul Gandhi said in his speech that he loved to play Badminton and Deepika Padukone is the daughter of the best Badminton player India ever produced. She played Badminton herself before entering Bollywood so Rahul ji will be interested in her. That could be the starting point of their relationship”, a hopeful Mr. Gupta went on to add.

However, experts are not too optimistic about this match as Deepika Padukone doesn’t belong to any Minority or Dalit Community so Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to meet her with too much warmth.

BJP President, Mr. Nitin Gadkari meanwhile has refused to take it as a condemnation of his leadership. Mr. Gadkari said, “How can they not be comfortable with my leadership if they are working so hard to ensure we win the elections with me as the president. We need to promote this out of the box thinking culture. Maybe, they can join Purti Group once this mission is accomplished, we need such smart thinkers in our company.”

Meanwhile, leading journalists and thinkers, especially those on Twitter, have termed this petition a result of “misogyny” and “patriarchal mindset” because it discounts the will and views of Deepika Padukone about Rahul Gandhi.

Ms. Padukone was unavailable for a comment but the online petition has already got 14,589 signatures and Mr. Gupta plans to submit the application to Deepika after reaching 100,000 signatures.

As per sources within this support group, Siddharth Mallaya and Dr. Vijay Mallaya were the first to sign this petition.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/deepika.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-supporters-start-petition-urging-deepika-padukone-to-date-rahul-gandhi-2801,BJP supporters start petition urging Deepika Padukone to date Rahul Gandhi,,1358758866.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a major blow to Modi, Bajaj Allianz refused to sell an insurance policy to the Gujarat Chief Minister that could have covered any physical, psychological, or electoral damages caused due to repeated “blows” reported in the media.

Narendra Modi had tried to buy such a policy as a bulk of news item related to him appeared as “blow to Modi” in the mainstream media.

“We feared for his wellbeing,” a local BJP leader told Faking News, “What if some of these blows actually cause some damage? Maybe a broken rib or something?”

Modi, apparently dealing with a blow to Modi.

The need for an insurance policy against blows was felt after Supreme Court refused to invalidate the appointment of Gujarat Lokayukta, which was reported as another blow to Modi.

Officials in Gujarat government and BJP leaders believe that the coming months will see several “blows to Modi” as the Lokayukta could release various reports hinting at irregularities in various government schemes.

“BJP doesn’t have any policy to deal with Lokayukta reports. Yeddyurappa had to resign,” the local BJP leader said, “In absence of a political policy, we decided to have an insurance policy.”

However, the first company that was approached, Bajaj Allianz, refused to create and sell any such policy.

“First of all, insurance policies are there for emergency and unexpected scenarios. ‘Blow to Modi’ falls under neither category,” Arjun Singhal, a Bajaj Allianz representative explained, “Secondly, how do we assess the damage? They kept on saying ‘blow to Modi’ and he won the elections again! There is no proof that such blows have caused him any physical, psychological, or electoral damages.”

“In fact, when he won elections last month, some said ‘blow to Modi’ as BJP couldn’t win over 150 seats in Gujarat,” he further explained, “Now imagine if we had sold this policy. Modi would have not only won the elections, he’d have claimed damages! Selling such a policy is inviting bankruptcy.”

While Narendra Modi fans claim that the insurance company’s refusal to sell any policy reflected the confidence industry had in Modi, his critics have claimed that the mere fact that Modi was looking for an insurance policy proved that there was a major blow to Modi’s confidence.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/modi-300x220.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/blow-to-modi-gujarat-cm-fails-to-get-insurance-against-blows-2762,Blow to Modi: Gujarat CM fails to get insurance against “blows”,,1357133180.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/samajwadi-party-mps-to-wear-roller-skates-for-faster-walkouts-2727,"New Delhi. Samajwadi Party MPs will wear roller skates inside Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the next session of parliament, Party leader Mulayam Singh announced today. This decision has been taken to speed up the process of walking out of parliament, something SP MPs frequently indulge in during every parliament session.

Speaking to media persons outside parliament after a walkout (reasons for which were unknown to Mr. Singh himself), Mr. Mulayam Singh said, “We too want to contribute to the functioning of parliament. Since we can’t help ourselves from walking out over every damn issue, we have decided to contribute by saving time and getting out of the parliament as quickly as we can.”

“Most of our MPs are getting pretty old too, myself included, so it gets a bit tiring to walk in and walk out all the time, so we have decided to skate our way in and out of the parliament,” he added.

A sample roller skater, though the actual ones used by the SP leaders could be red in color to represent the party ideology.

When asked why they bother to turn up if they are going to walkout every single time, Mr. Singh turned a bit philosophical and said, “Everyone’s role is defined in this world. This walkout is the only big role we have in our democracy; we can’t wait for a bigger role like some others, so have to fulfill this role only. That is why we come to the parliament to walk out of the parliament.”

Sources informed us that Mulayam Singh Yadav ji has gifted a pair of skates to Mr. Hamid Ansari as well so that he can exit quickly after 12 PM before Mayawati can catch him in the act.

Every Samajwadi Party MP has been instructed to learn roller skating by the time the next session of the parliament starts. Sources inform us that this is not the only thing they will be learning during the off-season between sessions. Self-defense training has also been scheduled for their MPs as they don’t want to look like cowards, wearing helmets on their heads in case Lok Sabha goes down West Bengal assembly path.

Every Samajwadi Party leader has been asked to attend a speech therapy session every day as well, as their shouts were frequently drowned by BSP MPs during the current session, a repeat of which, they want to avoid at any cost.

Even though Mr. Mulayam Singh was very confident that all their MPs will be able to learn roller skating by the time Budget session starts in 2013, not everyone shared his optimism.

Samajwadi Party leader, Mr. Mohan Singh said, “Is cheez ka to naam hi angrezi me hai to hamare saansad ise kaise seekh payenge.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/roller_skate-300x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/samajwadi-party-mps-to-wear-roller-skates-for-faster-walkouts-2727,Samajwadi Party MPs to wear roller skates for faster walkouts,,1355423594.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

An unnamed MP belonging to the Samajwadi Party was arrested by the CBI this evening when the investigators found him speaking in English. The MP was ordering Pizza and he said “yes, a cheesy dip too along with a bottle of Coke” when the sleuths arrested him.

He was arrested based on the statement by party leader Mohan Singh, who claimed that no one from Samajwadi Party could be involved in lobbying for Walmart as no party leader could speak English.

Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh speaking something in Hindi

“We suspect him to be involved in shady dealings with Walmart,” a CBI officer told Faking News on conditions of anonymity.

“We can’t reveal the name of the MP as per the orders from above,” he further said.

While government sources refused to comment over the issue, Samajwadi Party has rubbished the report. Party leader Mohan Singh reiterated that no MP from Samajwadi Party could speak English.

“Amar Singh was the last MP of our party who could speak English, and he spoke all that he knew while on phone with Bipasha Basu,” Mohan Singh claimed (he spoke in Hindi with English subtitles), “We don’t have any other leader who speaks English on phone.”

However, BJP insisted that the news was true and the UPA government was again using CBI to pressurize Samajwadi Party into supporting them on some other issue after FDI in retail.

“BSP is flexing muscles on the reservations in promotions issue, and the government can’t afford a belligerent SP at the same time, so they are using CBI,” BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed.

Meanwhile, Walmart India has clarified that their employees in India could speak Hindi and other regional languages.

“But that doesn’t mean we are talking to anyone in Hindi for lobbying,” a Walmart official hastily added to avoid any further controversy.

In other news, Rapidex, widely known for publishing language learning self-help books, has announced a special edition for non-English speaking leaders and politicians of India, so that they didn’t miss out on earning money through international lobbying.

“The special editions of this book will be given free if your shopping bill is over 3000 rupees in a Walmart store,” a Rapidex sales manager declared.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mohan_singh-300x236.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/cbi-arrests-samajwadi-party-leader-speaking-in-english-2721,CBI arrests Samajwadi Party leader speaking in English,,1355163615.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-be-converted-into-a-walmart-store-2713,"New Delhi. After Kapil Sibal declared in the Parliament that there was hardly any space in Delhi for Walmart to open a store, the government has taken corrective step so that the retail giant didn’t drop its plans to start operations in India after FDI in retail was approved by Lok Sabha.

“The existing Parliament building will be given to Walmart to carry out its business,” Parliamentary Affairs and Urban Development minister Kamal Nath informed, “Parliament will shift to a new building as the current structure is more than 85 years old and could turn unstable.”

“We could have turned the old i.e. the current building into a memorial or museum, but we thought that the better option was to earn some revenues,” the minister justified government’s decision.

“It will help the farmers, the poor, dalits, women, and minorities of India,” the minister further declared, but declined to explain.

Now things would be openly bought and sold inside

As expected, BJP has opposed the move saying it was an insult to the “temple” of democracy.

“This is simply ridiculous,” party leader and leading lawyer Arun Jaitley protested, “Now Afzal Guru will be pardoned because you can’t hang someone for plotting to loot a retail store.”

Parties like Samajwadi Party and BSP too have opposed the move and have asked the government to let them know if they can get any discounts while shopping at the new Walmart store coming up at the parliament building.

“Of course, we oppose turning the parliament into a store!” Mulayam Singh Yadav told Faking News, “We will protest by shopping at the store.”

While the politics over the Walmart store was as confusing as the debate in the parliament, Faking News asked experts if the current parliament building, feared to be weak for the parliament, could sustain the pressures of holding a mega retail store.

“I think the pressures exerted by a retail mall would be bearable compared to those by the MPs,” Vigyaan Shastri, an expert said, “There will not be frequent shouting in a Walmart store as happens in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and walk-outs will be balanced by walk-ins.”

However, Vigyaan said that the Walmart should take some precautions.

“The vaastu of the current building is not good for cash transactions,” he declared, “Last time they flashed cash in the building, all hell broke loose. Walmart should accept payments only through CBI.”

“Cards (issued) by Banks of India,” Vigyaan explained the meaning of CBI.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Parliament_of_India-300x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-be-converted-into-a-walmart-store-2713,Parliament to be converted into a Walmart store,,1354723565.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gujarati-boy-disappointed-to-know-tulika-wont-be-cm-if-congress-wins-2699,"Ahmedabad. Jignesh Modi, who turned 18 earlier this year and will be voting in the upcoming assembly elections next month, is confused over whom to vote for.

Jignesh had almost made up his mind to vote for Congress after seeing TV and online ads featuring a girl called Tulika. However, he was heartbroken to learn that the girl was just a TV actress and not the Chief Ministerial candidate of the party.

Television actress Tulika, who is often seen on TV news channels these days.

“This is cheating!” Jignesh protested, “I thought she will become the Chief Minister if Congress won, but she’s just an actress! Now I have no idea what to do! I don’t even know who the Gujarat Congress head is!”

Jignesh is the first known case where an aam admi has made up his mind after being influenced by TV ads by political parties. A similar case was reported in 2004, where a man in Delhi was believed to have turned a BJP supporter after watching India Shining ads, but investigations later revealed him to be a television journalist and not an aam aadmi.

“You can sell soaps, deodorants, insurances, or tickets to samagam of Nirmal Baba through TV ads, but not political beliefs,” a marketing professor of IIM Ahmedabad told Faking News.

“You have to buy political support, you don’t sell it,” the professor explained.

However, Congress has not lost all hopes. They are confident that spinners stalwarts like Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari can issue statements that might confuse people like Jignesh and make them believe that Tulika indeed could become the Chief Minister of Gujarat if they voted for Congress.

“It’s almost like making people believe that they will get to kiss Katrina Kaif if they buy Slice mango drink,” a Congress leader conceded that the task was not so easy.

“But then we have made people believe that there was no 2G scam!” he pointed out.

“Or we may even consider making Tulika the Chief Minister,” the Congress leader further said, “Just like Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tulika.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gujarati-boy-disappointed-to-know-tulika-wont-be-cm-if-congress-wins-2699,Gujarati boy disappointed to know Tulika won’t be CM if Congress wins,,1353778299.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/suresh-kalmadi-wants-to-host-cwg-again-to-prove-there-was-no-scam-2693,"New Delhi. Taking inspiration from the conclusions being drawn from the recent 2G spectrum auction, Suresh Kalmadi has decided to redeem himself and put an end to the whole issue of CWG scam.

Kalmadi has asked for permission to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Delhi again, so that he could prove that there was no scam when the Games were hosted in 2010.

“Just as the 2G spectrum licenses were offered again to telecom companies, why can’t CWG be held again in Delhi?” argued Kalmadi, who along with A Raja, was inducted as members in Parliamentary standing committees last month.

Where is the loss? Kalmadi too wants to ask.

Sources tell Faking News that Kalmadi has been feeling restless ever since the low revenues earned from the 2G spectrum auction has been cited as a clinching proof that the 2G scam never happened.

“Kalmadi feels that if the revenues figures realized in 2008 could be compared with those realized in 2012, the expenses figure realized in 2010 could be compared with those realized in 2014,” Lalit, a close aide of Kalmadi explained.

Explaining further, Lalit said, “See, the way prices are rising, very soon a roll of premium toilet paper could actually cost 4000 rupees, which was the figure quoted in media and which led to outrage. If the next CWG also sees a toilet paper of 4000 rupees, we can claim that there was no loss and hence no CWG scam!”

When asked how could one ignore factors like inflation between 2010 and 2014, Lalit said, “Just as we are ignoring the market dynamics and technological advances between 2008 and 2012 in the case of 2G spectrum licenses sales.”

Experts too believe that if India could convince Scotland, where 2014 Commonwealth Games are scheduled to be held in Glasgow, to forgo the host status and let Delhi host the games again, lawyers like Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari could argue that there was no CWG scam in 2010.

“An excessive focus on 1.86 lakh crore rupees led people to believe as if that was the only aspect of the 2G scam. The way rules were bent and companies were favored for suspected quid pro quo was almost kicked out from the public and media discourse,” Rajkumar, an expert pointed out.

“Similarly, if one could just focus just on numbers like ‘4000 rupees for a toilet paper’ and try to obfuscate the malpractices and shoddy preparations that were witnessed during the games, even the CWG scam could be laid to rest like the 2G scam,” he added.

“There is a strong case – comparisons with London Olympics were made and attempts were made to argue that CWG was not hosted that badly,” the expert further pointed out, “Kalmadi is not wrong if he thinks he too can get a clean chit and India can forget yet another scam.”

A day after he called Arvind Kejriwal similar to Rakhi Sawant, latest reports coming suggest that it could be Digvijay Singh himself who is similar to Rakhi Sawant. Both of them are reported to have got silicone implants – Rakhi for her breasts, and Digvijay for his brains.

“Yes, Diggi Raja was not too happy with the size of his brain,” confirmed Dr. Pinki Gandhi, who carried out the surgery on the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh around five years ago, “He asked if he could get his brain enhanced, and I suggested silicone implants.”

Intel Inside or Silicone Inside? Digvijay Singh is often found to be touching the now-revealed silicone part of his brain.

Dr. Gandhi confirmed that a substantial portion of Digvijay Singh’s brain is made of silicon cells and not grey cells, which is the case with normal human beings.

“We are not yet sure if silicone implants are good for mental health or not,” the neurosurgeon told Faking News in an exclusive interview, “We can’t conclude anything based only on how Digvijay Singh’s brain has been functioning after surgery; this could lead us to wrong conclusions and assumptions.”

The latest revelation has expectedly turned into a political controversy. Arvind Kejriwal has claimed that it was a corrupt practice by Digvijay Singh to have got silicone implants and not declare it.

“Either that part of his brain is not any asset, or he has not been truthful with his asset declarations,” Kejriwal claimed.

“This is good news. We should send Nitin Gadkari to Dr. Gandhi for some brain implant so that he doesn’t compare IQs again,” BJP leader Ram Jethmalani said, but not many in his party agreed to his views.

When contacted by Faking News for free comments, Rakhi Sawant said that the latest piece of information had shocked her.

“I will remove my silicone implants,” she declared, “I have been planning it for years. But this is too much. Jeejus! I don’t want to be compared with Digvijay Singh!”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/diggi-300x261.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-has-got-silicone-brain-implants-2685,Digvijay Singh has got silicone brain implants,,1352694288.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After BJP leader Sushma Swaraj woke up to the serious threat to Hinduism by Bollywood movies, as was originally pointed out by a Mahila Congress leader, both BJP and Congress have decided to join hands to discuss Bollywood movies during the upcoming winter session of the Parliament.

Addressing a press conference, Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting (Independent charge), Mr. Manish Tewari said, “We fully agree with Sushma ji, it is about time we discussed Bollywood movies in the parliament. We need to discuss something important for a change after wasting so many parliament sessions on trivial issues like Coalgate, CWG, 2G, Arjun Rampal… Sorry Jan Lokpal… See, it is so hard to even remember the names of such minor issues!”

Such scenes will be reviewed by the MPs

“Now we can focus on SOTY & OMG and every other movie where something offensive may have been said,” he added.

Kamal Nath, the new Parliamentary Affairs Minister has also supported Sushma Swaraj. He said, “I was worried that the first session of the parliament after I became the minister will be lost to Salman Khurshid, Nitin Gadkari, and Robert Vadra, but thankfully, we will discuss Alia Bhatt instead.”

Speaker of Lok Sabha, Ms. Meira Kumar too has welcomed this decision by the political parties to discuss the Radha song in the parliament. She said, “I am tired of saying baith jaaiye during every session. I swear I won’t say baith jaaiye if some MPs dance to this song to re-enact the song in parliament.”

BJP leaders have thanked Congress leaders for such generosity and have promised that the party would work with Congress to ban any movie that hurt political sentiments too apart from religious ones, especially movies like Kissa Kursi Ka, which was banned for being based on emergency, or Amu, which failed to release in cinema halls for being based on 1984 riots.

“4 movies hum unke ban karwaayenge, 4 movies woh humaare ban karwaayenge,” Nitin Gadkari, the BJP President explained the agreement between Congress and BJP for the Winter Session.

Sources inform us that preparations have already been made to put a giant projector screen in both the houses of the parliament where every Bollywood movie released this year will be played to find out offensive items in these movies.

Kapil Sibal, specializing in finding offensive items online, has been especially requested to be present during every screening.

Sources further claim that Jism 2 may get more than one show due to the probability that there was a lot more offensive content in that film, which otherwise is not noticed as people concentrate only on Sunny Leone during the first show.

The mango man of India wasn’t much impressed with this development though. Aam Singh, a common man said, “World is definitely going to end in December 2012. First Congress and BJP agreed that Kejriwal was a bad guy and now they agree again?”

However, some filmmakers were very happy with this decision.

Ram Gopal Verma tweeted from his account, “They will show Bhoot Returns during winter session of the parliament. FINALLY someone will see the film.”

“Though I hope they don’t interpret it as being offensive to re-election of Barack Obama, and ban it!” he tweeted again.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/soty_radha-300x192.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-and-congress-to-spend-whole-winter-session-watching-movies-in-parliament-2681,BJP and Congress to spend whole Winter Session watching movies in Parliament,,1352444569.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nitin-gadkari-goes-for-image-makeover-launches-being-honest-t-shirts-2658,"Mumbai. BJP President Nitin Gadkari, who has been in the line of fire since last week, has decided to go for an image makeover by introducing his own brand of t-shirts called “Being Honest”.

The motivation clearly seems to have come from Salman Khan’s “Being Human’ campaign, which is supposed to have helped the Bollywood actor fight some bad press.

Gadkari flaunting his appeal

“These t-shirts are for all those honest politicians who are unfairly targeted by the media and branded as corrupt,” Nitin Gadkari announced and expressed confidence that his t-shirt will work.

“If Salman Khan can be accepted and loved by people after the black buck and hit-and-run cases, why can’t politicians be accepted and loved by people after black money and loot-and-run cases?” Gadkari argued.

Gadkari further announced that he’d be sending one special t-shirt to Salman.

“Salman Khurshid,” he clarified.

While Salman Khurshid is yet to comment on the offer, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has supported Gadkari’s initiative.

Speaking exclusively to Faking News, which he lambasted for portraying politicians in a negative light, Pawar turned nostalgic about the good old days when people could openly indulge in corruption and no one was bothered.

“I don’t know if the media has become cleverer or we politicians are getting dumber and losing the art of corruption,” he wondered.

Although black color is supposed to represent evil, the t-shirt has been launched in black as it can absorb all smear campaigns by the media.

The NCP chief revealed that he had decided to retire from fighting elections because he was planning to play the role of a mentor to politicians who are being caught by the media and RTI activists.

“I am also designing a Common Entrance Test for Corruption (CET-C), which will determine if a politician was smart enough to conduct a scam and get away,” Pawar disclosed.

“We politicians need to redefine and reinvent ourselves, and this t-shirt is a good beginning,” Pawar came back to the core issue, “Gadkari ji will get all the support from me. I am willing to become the exclusive distributor of these t-shirts.”

“Baseless allegations!” Pawar said when Faking News asked if his offer of being the exclusive distributor of the t-shirt proved that he and Gadkari had close business relationships.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gadkari-270x300.jpeg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nitin-gadkari-goes-for-image-makeover-launches-being-honest-t-shirts-2658,"Nitin Gadkari goes for image makeover, launches “Being Honest” t-shirts",,1351531796.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his disappointment over Rahul Gandhi’s decision not to join his government, it’s now the turn of Congress office bearers to be disappointed.

Rahul Gandhi has said that he’d not yet accept the No. 2 position in Congress i.e. that of a “Secretary General” or “Working President” as was being speculated by the media.

“He still wants to strengthen the Youth Congress, especially in Tamil Nadu, where things are not so good,” a Congress source told Faking News.

Many political analysts were trying to decipher this enigmatic smile to find out if Rahul Gandhi was ready for a bigger role

“Rahul Gandhi was very disappointed when Youth Congress workers burnt Times of India copies to protest against Time magazine, and recently there were allegations of irregularities in the internal elections of the organization,” the source explained why Rahul Gandhi still wanted to devote time in Youth Congress.

However, sources confirm that there is a huge pressure on Rahul Gandhi to accept a “bigger role” and come out of this whole “youth” business.

“There should be some change, just like the cabinet was reshuffled,” a Congress source explained, “It may not make hell lot of difference, but it makes news and gives a sense that some progress has taken place. It’s high time Rahul Gandhi took a bigger role.”

But reports indicate that Rahul Gandhi has said a clear-cut no to the post of Secretary General, which he found to be an inverted version of the current post that he was holding i.e. General Secretary.

“Maybe the thought that an existing General Secretary had to stand over his heads to become Secretary General,” a Congress worker guessed why Rahul Gandhi might have said no to being promoted.

With “Secretary General” ruled out, party members tried to persuade Rahul Gandhi to accept the “Working President” post, but sources say that this was opposed by his close aide and adviser Digvijaya Singh.

“Diggi Raja said that if we create a post called ‘Working President’ in the party, BJP members would start taunting that the need of such a post was felt because the current President Mrs. Sonia Gandhi was ‘not working’,” the source revealed.

With both the options of being No. 2 in the party being rejected, party leaders are trying to convince Rahul Gandhi to accept No. 2.5 position in the party and thus finally assume a bigger role.

Congress leaders refused to explain what does No. 2.5 position mean.

“First let’s find what does this ‘bigger role’ mean, and then we’ll explain 2.5 to you,” a Congress leader said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Rahul-Gandhi-300x239.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-not-ready-for-no-2-position-in-congress-may-accept-no-2-5-position-2656,"Rahul Gandhi not ready for No. 2 position in Congress, may accept No. 2.5 position",,1351499880.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nd-tiwaris-imaginary-son-listed-as-imaginary-director-in-gadkaris-company-2648,"New Delhi. The list of people listed as directors in companies that controlled shares in Nitin Gadkari’s Purti Power and Sugar Limited is getting weird and weird. After real people like Gadkari’s driver, cook, astrologer, accountant, now it’s the turn of fake people listed as directors.

One of such fake people is an imaginary son of ND Tiwari.

“The documents accessed from the Registrar of Companies show a certain ‘Satyanarayan Dutt Tiwari’ as director of one of the companies,” a source told Faking News, “Father’s name of this Satyanarayan is given as ‘ND Tiwari’ and permanent address is mentioned as ‘Bedroom, Raj Bhavan’ – which clearly indicates that it referred to the Congress leader ND Tiwari.”

BJP President Nitin Gadkari claimed that allegations against him were imaginary

Faking News reporter tried to locate this “Satyanarayan Dutt Tiwari” but we gave up after five minutes of extensive investigative journalism i.e. Google search, and we concluded that it indeed was an imaginary character.

“I think this was the smartest move by Gadkari and he should have shown only imaginary sons of ND Tiwari as directors in his company,” Om Prakash, an expert on everything argued, “People listed as directors in his companies have no idea that they have such position, so in essence they are imaginary. So why not have ‘genuinely’ imaginary directors?”

“Also, if someone accuses Gadkari of forgery for having shown an allegedly imaginary person on legal papers, he can reasonably challenge the accuser to disprove that no such son of ND Tiwari exists,” Om added, “And you know, this is almost impossible.”

However, not everyone agrees.

“Dude, this is dangerous,” another expert told Faking News, “If such a son of Tiwari actually exists, and there is every possibility, he’d fight for his rights unlike those drivers and cooks of Gadkari!”

While experts are busy debating whether Gadkari was smart or dumb to have indulged in such chicanery, Arvind Kejriwal has claimed that this again proved that Congress and BJP were two sides of the same coin.

“Congress would have done their best to hide the sons of ND Tiwari, which could have helped Gadkari hide the directors of his company. You don’t need a bigger proof,” Kejriwal said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nitin-gadkari-253x300.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/nd-tiwaris-imaginary-son-listed-as-imaginary-director-in-gadkaris-company-2648,ND Tiwari’s imaginary son listed as imaginary director in Gadkari’s company,,1351176907.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/expose-me-please-little-known-corrupt-politician-requests-arvind-kejriwal-2634,"New Delhi. A little-known politician from a remote part of India has requested Arvind Kejriwal to expose him so that at least he is known for his deeds. This unidentified politician has sent a big parcel containing dozens of documents that allegedly prove how he has amassed huge wealth through corrupt practices.

“Yes, we have received such papers but are not sure if they are genuine and authentic,” Manish Sisodia, a close aide of Arvind Kejriwal confirmed, “We even googled about this person, but it seems there is absolutely no news about him or his claimed corrupt deeds.”

The documents received by IAC (India Against Corruption), which are accompanied by a passionately written letter, claim that this little-known politician is frustrated with people like Salman Khurshid hogging all the limelight for an alleged scam of just 71 lakhs while no one even knows his name.

Experts believe that if IAC starts selling t-shirts with “I was exposed by Kejriwal” printed on them, the organization can make good money.

“Sir, I siphon off 71 lakhs rupees from government funds almost on a daily basis. Don’t you think I need at least some recognition from you or the people of this country?” the letter addressed to Arvind Kejriwal read.

The politician claims that no welfare or development schemes by any government have ever been implemented in his constituency, yet he wins the elections regularly as an independent candidate in a far off region in the country assumed to be under the control of Naxalites.

“Apart from being a community leader, which gets me votes on caste basis, I’ve also created an ecosystem, where everyone is earning, even though peanuts, through corrupt means, and hence corruption is almost a non-issue here,” the politician explained his politics in the letter.

This yet-to-be-identified little-known politician further claimed that he was “reasonably certain” that being accused of massive corruption will not harm his career; instead it could help him get an entry into national level politics.

“All this wealth is meaningless if people don’t even know me,” the politician is reported to have argued in his letter to Kejriwal.

Arvind Kejriwal and his team members are currently trying to ascertain the identity and “achievements” of this politician, but are not sure if they should expose him.

“The numbers he has quoted are impressive, almost CAG level, but then what’s the point if no one knows him?” an activist of IAC told Faking News on conditions of anonymity, “It’s almost like Karan Johar signing a Bhojpuri actor opposite Kareena Kapoor in a high budget movie, just because that Bhojpuri actor’s movie have been a hit in some parts of Bihar.”

After being blamed by Khap Panchayat for incidents of rape in Haryana, “fast food” has been blamed for corruption by Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi, who is facing heat for his business deals with the real estate company DLF.

“I think Khaps are right, fast food like chowmein causes hormonal disturbances and incites people to indulge in wrongdoings,” Vadra said in an exclusive interview to Faking News, “I love noodles and fast food, and maybe that caused some bad business deals between me and DLF.”

Vadra claimed that he was innocent and honest but noodles might have done something wrong

While Vadra refused to accept that there was any corruption involved in his deals with DLF, he demanded that the government should form a committee to find out how much of corruption in the country was due to fast food.

“Elders from Khap Panchayats can be involved and we must launch a war on chowmein so that our country is crime and corruption free,” Vadra suggested.

“People wrongly blame my family, I mean my wife’s family, for corruption in this country. It’s the fast food that must be blamed, not us,” he added.

Vadra’s statements have been welcomed by Khap and Congress leaders, who gave a clean cheat to Robert Vadra in the rape DLF case.

“Our government respects the sentiments of Khap Panchayat and Mr. Robert Vadra and we are trying to find if chowmein is a kind of biological weapon that China has unleashed on us,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said.

Experts believe that the government might blame China for rising incidents of crimes in Haryana and cases of corruption in the country. War hysteria could be created so that people forget the scams and silly statements by various leaders, experts warn.

“They are already working on a song titled ‘Blame China’ that will be aired on all TV channels after the Bharat Nirman ads,” a source claimed.

“If there are any diplomatic issues in blaming China, the government might just blame the chowmein, as chowmein can’t speak for itself and will not join any anti-corruption movement that prides itself on hunger strikes,” the source added.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/robert-vadra1-300x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/robert-vadra-blames-fast-food-for-his-deals-with-dlf-2605,Robert Vadra blames fast food for his deals with DLF,,1350369741.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arindam-chaudhuri-nirmal-baba-in-race-to-become-indias-new-finance-minister-2395,"New Delhi. After Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee successfully resigned yesterday, hunt for his replacement has begun even though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has retained the finance portfolio for now.

Although Manmohan Singh is rumored to be doing nothing as PM and thus having enough free time to hold an additional portfolio, experts believe that India needs a full-time Finance Minister as the economy is believe to be in deep shit.

To help India recover from this mess, the names of the following persons for the post of Union Finance Minister are being considered, sources tell Faking News:

Arindam Chaudhuri claims he is the number one, ahead of all other contestants.

Arindam Chaudhuri: A leading economist and management guru, who can sell dreams to millions of youth belonging to the Middle Class, currently believed to be angry with the government. Government sources believe that UPA government needs someone as capable as Prof. Chaudhuri, who can dare Indians to think beyond inflation, corruption, and incompetence, and land into utopia.

Prof. Chaudhuri had earlier presented a budget for Rahul Gandhi, which is being seen as a subtle hint that he wants the job as the nation’s number one Finance Minister.

Jairam Ramesh, apparently trying to scare away all the problems.

Jairam Ramesh: He seemed to have learnt the hint of subtle job application from Prof. Chaudhuri and has sent a letter to Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi on how to fix economy earlier today. With this, he has removed all chances of Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy-chairman of the Planning Commission, being considered for the job.

Known for his strong views on toilets and mobile phones, Ramesh, currently the Union Rural Development Minister, is expected to flush all the problems though simple means like sending an SMS, the favorite approach of Indian masses towards solving a problem.

Baba Ramdev, when he heard Digvijay Singh speaking about him.

Baba Ramdev: An expert on black money, corruption, textiles, Ayurveda, and Yoga, Baba Ramdev could be made the Finance Minister to please Samajwadi Party, with whom Baba is supposed to be close, and to break the unity of India Against Corruption and Internet Hindus team.

Although he is not the favorite among the Congress party, some sections in the party believe that instead of finding another PV Narsimha Rao Pranab Mukherjee, the party could blame everything on Ramdev if the economy doesn’t shape up. And if it shapes up, they can credit the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.

However, his candidature is being bitterly opposed by Digvijay Singh, who supports Nirmal Baba.

Keeping cash in black purse can solve the financial crisis

Nirmal Baba: Digvijay Singh is reported to have become his fan the day Narendra Modi made fun of the godman who has the power to remove poverty though green chutney and samosa. Following the age old wisdom of “enemy’s enemy is friend”, Digvijay Singh decided to support Nirmal Baba even though Nirmal Baba has never accused his detractors of being RSS agents.

Since Nirmal Baba could convince millions to donate money to him, government sources believe he would be helpful in attracting investment. Furthermore, many believe that his solutions could work as all other steps by the government have failed.

P Chidambaram, apparently with a file filled with clean chits.

P Chidambaram: He was the Finance Minister in UPA-I, before he was made the Home Minister as Shivraj Patil was making mess of a job there. Now that many are accusing Pranab Mukherjee of having made mess of a job, some believe that Chidambaram, the mess-cleaner should be called in.

However, he doesn’t have the popular support as he is believed to fight mess with even more mess. Also, Subramanian Swamy has been after Chidambaram’s life and many believe that he could soon be forced to resign, which will force the government to go through this exercise of choosing a new Finance Minister yet again.

He knows run-rate better than anyone, but what about repo-rate?

Sachin Tendulkar: For no rhyme or reason, some experts believe that making Tendulkar the Finance Minister of India could ‘boost’ the Indian economy. Congress leader and IPL Chief Rajiv Shukla is reported to be bullish on making Tendulkar the minister as he believes this will force aam aadmi to forget all other problems. If things get any worse, Shukla proposes to give Bharat Ratna to Tendulkar, sources claim.

Tendulkar is reportedly least interested and has declined the offer saying he doesn’t know anything about Finance or Economy, but government authorities are trying their best to convince him by giving examples of Kapil Sibal and saying, “Look at him, do you think he knows anything about Education or Technology?”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Arindam-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/arindam-chaudhuri-nirmal-baba-in-race-to-become-indias-new-finance-minister-2395,"Arindam Chaudhuri, Nirmal Baba in race to become India’s new Finance Minister",,1340798342.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

No longer the Finance Minister of India and not yet the President of the country, Pranab Mukherjee is reported to be treading carefully for the next one month when he’d be virtually an aam aadmi or a common man left at the mercy of the government and the authorities.

Pranab Da is especially worried as he has also been given farewell by the Congress Working Committee and thus ceased to be a political entity, in his own words.

“I know how messed up the economy is, better than you,” Pranab Da told Faking News reporter, “And hence I am more worried about living my life as an aam aadmi than any other aam aadmi out there.”

Pranab Mukherjee thinking if he should use Delhi Metro or DTC bus for traveling

Practically jobless for the next one month, the former Finance Minister immediately took out his calculator and found out if he had enough cash to survive in the National Capital Region without a government job and political post.

“Thank God I have the MP’s house and I’m not letting it go before I get the keys of Rashtrapati Bhavan,” Pranab Da said, “Real estate rates are too high and I can’t afford to rent or buy a decent house. Nor can I live in hotels as we are still on austerity drive.”

“And this Sheila Aunty raised the electricity rates the day I resigned!” the veteran leader pointed out, “With monsoon delayed like FDI in retail, we’ll have fans and AC switched on the whole day. The bijli bill will scare me more than the Lokpal bill!”

“Thank again for the MP’s bungalow and I don’t even have to worry about the electricity bill; don’t know why Tendulkar doesn’t want it!” he wondered.

Though relieved that he doesn’t have to pay rent or electricity bill, Pranab Da expressed disappointment that monsoon session of the Parliament was a few weeks away, which will make it difficult for him to have food at the Parliament canteen at subsidized rates.

“I know how costly food items are,” he said, sounding worried over rising prices for the first time.

“Sharad Pawar ji will retire as the ICC President this weekend; maybe he will take care of agriculture after that,” hoped the former Finance Minister, often blamed by Pawar for rising food prices.

Like a middle-class unemployed common man, a worried Pranab Da then went on to compare his situation with his rival PA Sangma, who too has been practically jobless after having resigned from his party to contest Presidential elections.

And like an aam aadmi, Pranab Da then felt happy that his own situation was not as hopeless as Sangma’s.

“Poor Sangma has to keep on calling various persons to seek support for his candidature. God! That itself will push the telephone bill too high, given that I had increased the service tax in the last budget! Thank God I called everyone, including Advani ji, from the office phone,” Pranab Da said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pranab-mukherjee-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pranab-mukherjee-happy-he-has-to-live-like-aam-aadmi-just-for-a-month-2393,Pranab Mukherjee happy he has to live like aam aadmi just for a month,,1340725095.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-university-launches-new-course-bachelor-of-secularism-2379,"New Delhi. Taking note of the development that “secularism” was back in the limelight after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar demanded a secular Prime Ministerial candidate for NDA, Delhi University has launched a course in secularism – Bachelor of Secularism or B.Sc.

“There will be no minimum qualification needed to get admitted to the course,” DU vice-chancellor Prof. Dinesh Singh informed, “We thought we would lose out on a big pool of potential candidates – political leaders of India – if we insist on some educational qualifications.”

The course will help students learn different types of secularism and become a certified secular after successfully completing the course.

“We have often seen a person’s secular credentials being questioned, so we thought we’d start awarding such credentials,” Prof. Singh said.

One can become a certified secular person now in just three years

When asked if the university had acquired the necessary rights to issue certificates of secularism – something that has been the prerogative of a few intellectuals and political leaders – Prof. Singh said that time had come when different centers started issuing certificates of secularism.

“Traditionally an institute like JNU or a politician like Digvijay Singh would issue certificates of secularism, but we think that this trend needs to be changed,” he said.

“In fact, we’d be awarding degrees,” he added.

The proposed course will be of three year duration. Participants would be exposed to different types of secularism in the first two years. The student can choose to specialize in an area or go for a ‘pass course’ in the final year of the course.

The different types of secularism, as identified for the course curriculum, are – Western Secularism (separation of the Church and the State), Gandhian Secularism (equal respect to all religions), Nehruvian Secularism (equal confusion towards all religions), Atheistic Secularism (equal disrespect to all religions), Pseudo Secularism (more respect to the minority religions), and Indian Secularism (no definition; pass course, no specialization).

“We were also thinking of offering specialization in Instant Secularism (opposition to Narendra Modi) but we think one doesn’t need to study for three years for this, so we are sticking to the five areas of specialization,” Prof. Singh informed.

The announcement by Delhi University has received mixed reactions. Many students have welcomed the move to have no minimum educational qualification as cut-off marks for admission to DU colleges were already going sky high, but some question the utility of such a course.

“Will being secular get me a day job?” wondered a class 12th student.

Also, as expected, the course has already landed into a political controversy.

“What about reservations during admission? Secularism without social justice is useless,” demanded a leader from a regional party, “Also, a minority institution like St. Stephen’s College should have more autonomy in running such courses than a college like Hindu College.”

HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has promised to look into such concerns. “If DU doesn’t fall in line, we will authorize JNU to launch M.Sc. – Master of Secularism – course,” Sibal told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/certificate-250x193.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-university-launches-new-course-bachelor-of-secularism-2379,Delhi University launches new course B.Sc – Bachelor of Secularism,,1340185976.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/wish-we-had-put-similar-efforts-before-voting-realizes-aam-aadmi-2373,"New Delhi. Political leaders, who are perceived to lead a corrupt, criminal, and debauched way of life in eyes of the aam aadmi, could get the desired respect and status in the society thanks to their present conduct around the Presidential elections, experts believe. Aam aadmi could stop lampooning their leaders and start learning from them, a recent research claims.

“As various leaders meet each other multiple times and reassess their position on Presidential elections, the aam aadmi in the country has realized how important a vote was,” Joginder Jadhav, an expert on social issues told Faking News.

“An aam aadmi is realizing how much analysis and effort needs to be put before supporting anyone in any elections,” Jadhav explained, “He is contrasting this with his own effort that he had put when he voted in the last elections.”

Jadhav claims that he arrived at this conclusion after undertaking a research work where he met various people in the last few days. All the research respondents agreed that their leaders had opened their eyes on the issue of importance of a vote.

Political leaders are putting so much thought before sending a person to this house, which doesn’t have much power as such. However an aam aadmi doesn’t think much before sending a person to the Parliament and state assemblies.

“I met people who had voted after watching TV ads!” Jadhav claims, “Now these guys are realizing how they wasted a rare opportunity.”

Jadhav points out that the best thing about the ongoing political maneuverings around election of a new President of India is the absence of allegations of money being used to buy votes, as was alleged during Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand earlier this year in March.

“When the common voter hears about votes of his leaders being bought by money, he feels that the leaders are as stupid as him. Because he also sells his vote for a few thousands rupees, sometimes just for a bottle of wine during the assembly or general elections,” Jadhav pointed out.

“However he’s really shocked when he sees his leaders being motivated by factors other than economical, religious, regional, or casteist – the greatest influencing factors when an aam aadmi votes,” Joginder Jadhav explained.

In the ongoing drama, Mamata Banerjee, a Bengali, is not too keen to support Pranab Mukherjee, a fellow Bengali, while Mulayam Singh Yadav, who often flaunts his pro-Muslim image, is willing to ignore APJ Abdul Kalam.

PA Sangma, despite being an ST, is finding no popular support, while the original OBC candidate Sam Pitroda’s name has vanished like anything.

“No caste, region, religion, or language factor seems to be working here,” Jadhav explains, “For an aam aadmi, his leaders are not appearing as someone who is blindly and easily influenced by sectarian passions – something he is always consumed with when the election season arrives – and this is what has opened his eyes.”

Jadhav claims that aam aadmi could use this opportunity to realize that he too needs to put similar effort before supporting a candidate and casting his vote.

“Though I fear that aam aadmi may forget this learning soon, as they forget everything else,” Jadhav ended on a not-so-positive note.

Surprised at this sudden encounter, the mater blaster initiated a conversation with the Prime Minister, the transcript of which was accessed by Faking News through our exclusive Parliament sources: —

Tendulkar taking oath as Rajya Sabha MP

Sachin Tendulkar: Aila! Prime Minister of India! How come you are here!?

Manmohan Singh: I’m also a Rajya Sabha MP!

Sachin: Oh! So, you were also nominated?

MMS: Well, kind of.

Sachin: I was nominated for playing Cricket, what about you?

MMS: hmmm… I was the Finance Minister when India opened up the economy. You know – that thing called liberalization, which helped India go global. Else no international brands would have come to India and you would have got no sponsorship deals.

Sachin: Oh, I thought I got those deals because I played good cricket and I was popular.

MMS: No! You got this Rajya Sabha nomination for playing well and being popular. Don’t confuse the two issues.

Sachin: hmmm… frankly, I did have some doubts over correlation between playing well and earning after I saw Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja earning so much in the IPL auctions.

MMS: I don’t know much about IPL, though Mamata Banerjee had sent me a mail asking me to tweet about Kolkata’s victory.

Sachin: Never mind; our PM should know issues related to GDP better than IPL.

MMS:

Sachin: Sorry, did I say something inappropriate?

MMS: well, sort of, because the latest GDP figures are not good.

Sachin: Oh sorry! But when I was coming to the parliament with Rajiv Shukla, he said there is a lot of growth.

MMS: He might have been referring to the growth that an MP experiences. Maybe he was trying to motivate you to become an active parliamentarian.

Sachin: Oh, Shukla ji is always cryptic. Last time he took me to Sonia Gandhi and told me that meeting her was necessary as she was part of the government. Later I realized that meeting you or the President was enough. After all, you head the government, right?

MMS:

Sachin: Sorry, did I say something inappropriate again?

MMS: Never mind. You tell me how did you like the Parliament, especially Rajya Sabha?

Sachin: It’s good. I had heard some people say that parliament is full of murderers, dacoits, and rapists, but I didn’t find any.

MMS: Attendance is not mandatory unless party issues whip; so you won’t find all the members every day.

Sachin: What!? You mean there are actually such people in the Parliament?

MMS: Oops! I think I misinterpreted your statement. But forget what you asked. It’s true that attendance is not mandatory. And since you don’t belong to any party, you can skip it altogether. But try coming to the Parliament. Our canteen is very cheap and offers good food.

Sachin: Sure! Thanks for the invitation Sir.

MMS: You are welcome! And yes, that invitation was on behalf of UPA chairperson Madam Sonia Gandhi.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-named-manmohan-singh-fails-in-cbse-economics-paper-2351,"New Delhi. 17-year-old Mannu, known as Manmohan Singh in school records, was shocked to find out that he had been awarded an ‘F’ grade in the Economics paper of CBSE class 12th exams, the results of which were announced today.

Manmohan was one of the favorites of the teachers in his school and was expected to top the charts, but the results have shocked everyone beyond belief.

“He has been a studious student throughout the school and we thought he’d do us proud, especially in the Economics paper,” Sonia Sharma, the Principal of Upahaar Vidyalaya said.

Mannu had shown special interest in Economics and Finance related subjects pretty early in the school. He was spotted by school teachers when they saw him teach his seniors the basics of economic theories a few years back.

Unconfirmed sources say that Manmohan Singh didn’t write a word in the answer paper

“We were very impressed with his knowledge and dedication, and soon he became the favorite of every teacher, even though he was quite a loner and a boy of few words,” informed Pranab Mehta, a teacher of Finance in Upahaar Vidyalaya.

Mannu had fared well in the Class Xth exams a couple of years back and had decided to pursue higher studies in the Commerce stream in the same school.

“We thought he’ll win the Student of the Year award that year but somehow Sonia Madam made him the head-boy of the school and monitor of his class,” Pranab recalled the developments that had surprised most of the teachers.

“Yes, it was a surprising, in fact, a shocking decision,” PC Antony, another teacher agreed with Pranab, “Being a head-boy or a head-girl is a different ball game altogether. It’s for students who are outgoing, diplomatic, sometimes even brash – qualities not guaranteed in an academically brilliant mind.”

Many teachers believe that the extra responsibilities and work as a head-boy and class monitor ruined Manmohan Singh’s academic performance.

“He faced many challenges,” Kapil Sinha, another teacher recalled, “One of his classmates and good friends, Anand Raja, stole three laptops from the school’s IT lab and refused to return them. Mannu had to face pressure from everyone and the school management ultimately decided to expel Raja.”

“I wonder if he got any time to study for the board exams!” he added.

“He didn’t even get the support of a head-girl even though Upahaar Vidyalaya is a co-ed school,” a teacher told Faking News on conditions of anonymity, “Sonia Madam did away with the practice of having a head-girl when she joined the school in 1998.”

Many teachers fear that today Manmohan Singh is neither good at being a brilliant student nor a good manager as a head-boy.

Manmohan Singh, or Mannu, declined to comment on his performance.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/fail-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/boy-named-manmohan-singh-fails-in-cbse-economics-paper-2351,Boy named Manmohan Singh fails in CBSE Economics paper,,1338202813.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-find-out-if-the-caveman-drew-offensive-cartoons-2339,"New Delhi. After unearthing a more than 60 years old cartoon on Jawaharlal Nehru and BR Ambedkar, which appeared offensive to every one of them, the honorable members of the Parliament have decided to inspect every place of archaeological significance to find out if the Indians living in the medieval, ancient, or pre-historic times made fun of some national figure or icon. If any such offensive drawing is found, MPs will immediately remove them.

“What if there was someone who was drawing offensive cartoons on the walls of cave while our forefathers were busy hunting animals for food outside in the wilderness?” Kancha Raja, an MP belonging to the LLB (Let’s Look Backwards) party expressed his concerns.

The offensive cartoon that was threatening the foundation of democracy in India all these years

“In fact, I had seen such cave paintings in NCERT textbooks when I was in school,” Kancha claimed, “I could never understand them then, but now I think they were made to mock our hardworking and honest forefathers.”

“Those paintings of bulls drawn during the Harappan era, I find them so offensive. I think they mean bullshit in pictorial language,” the MP interpreted the cave paintings and declared them offensive.

Kancha was backed by honorable members cutting across party lines who agreed that any cartoons drawn in prehistoric times were the most worrisome aspect of today’s modern life and needed to be resolved.

“We should also have a re-look at those nude paintings in Khajuraho,” Pornveer Pandey, another MP suggested, “I think they were made by sinful and shameful people. We must not accept anything just because they were accepted in the past.”

“We are a matured democracy now,” he added.

Agreeing with such observations and grave concerns raised by the honorable members, the Parliament of India decided to form a committee to inspect every place and work of historical and archaeological importance and dig out any dirt that was never known to the people of those times.

“Kapil Sibal ji will head the committee as he is expert in assessing offensive materials,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal informed.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cartoon-200x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-find-out-if-the-caveman-drew-offensive-cartoons-2339,Parliament to find out if the caveman drew offensive cartoons,,1336760690.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/debate-around-presidential-elections-reveals-hamid-ansari-as-vice-president-2325,"New Delhi. Millions of college/KFC going and TOI reading youth had no idea who the Vice President of India was, or whether India had any such constitutional post at all, but thanks to the news reports and TV debates around the upcoming elections to choose a new President of India, these guys now know about Hamid Ansari and the post of Vice President.

Experts believe that this could be the most significant outcome of the elections, which usually results in selection of a person who gets to spend five years in a big house called Rashtrapati Bhavan with frequent foreign trips and post-retirement benefits.

“I used to think Hamid Ansari was the President of Afghanistan!” said Pritam Kapur, an MTV Roadies aspirant who also discovered Hamid Karzai due to the ongoing presidential debate.

Hamid Ansari, looks somewhat similar to IK Gujral, another person about whom the youth didn’t know anything.

Super excited at his twin discoveries, Pritam further concluded that the post of Vice President must have been created as the President was often out of the country on foreign trips, or because there was too much workload, like taking decisions on hanging someone for murder, for a Lonely Planet lonely President.

“But where does the Vice President live? Is there any Up-Rashtrapati Bhavan? Or he is allocated a room in Rashtrapati Bhavan? I heard there are over 1000 rooms there, no?” Pritam wondered.

Some others like Deepak Naik are in a better position as they claim to have known about Hamid Ansari, though they didn’t know that he was the Vice President.

“I was switching channels sometimes back and I accidentally saw those scenes of that guy named Rajneeti something tearing that Lokpal script in the Parliament,” Deepak recalled, “And I had seen this guy sitting in the chair of Meera Kumar – that lady who always says ‘baith jaaiye, baith jaaiye’ – I thought he was assistant of Meera Kumar. Man, he turned out to be the assistant of Pratibha Patil!”

Faking News talked to at least 19 more young Indians and most of them agreed that they came to know about Hamid Ansari or the post of Vice President only after the recent news reports.

“Man, now don’t tell me there is some Vice Prime Minister too!” Alok, one of the respondents said, “Wait.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-claims-party-symbol-is-hand-of-rajinikanth-2317,"New Delhi. After nominating Sachin Tendulkar for Rajya Sabha and giving it an impression as if the cricketer had joined the party, Congress is now targeting superstar Rajinikanth to garner popular support. As part of this strategy, a Congress leader has claimed that the party symbol – a human palm – was actually the hand of Rajinikanth.

News channels, without questioning the logic of the statement, immediately turned the statement into headlines and breaking news, which led many people into believing that Rajinikanth was endorsing Congress party.

“It’s the hand of Rajinikanth, the hand of god,” declared Congress leader Rajiv Shukla, who had earlier arranged for a meeting between Sonia Gandhi and Sachin Tendulkar, where Sonia Gandhi apparently wished Sachin on completing 100 centuries and 39 years, but it was reported as if Sachin had gone there to collect his Rajya Sabha I-card.

This is the closest Rajinikanth’s hand looks to the Congress symbol, but such technicalities were ignored in the debate that followed.

Since he couldn’t arrange a meeting with Rajinikanth, Shukla showed to journalists the bouquet that Sonia Gandhi had sent to Rajini when he was admitted to hospital last year.

Faking News reporter tried to enquire how the bouquet, which should have been with Rajini if he had accepted it, was with Shukla, but the queries were ignored by the Congress leader. Rest of the reporters had already broken the news and a TV debate was taking place if Congress could win every seat in Tamil Nadu.

“Shameful of Thalaivar to have joined a corrupt party,” tweeted an anti-Congress activist, who was heckled by Rajinikanth fans on Twitter. Rest of the people cracked Rajinikanth and Kolaveri jokes as the virtual world virtually believed that Rajini had joined politics.

BJP, not able to understand anything and shocked by verdict on Bangaru Laxman, first demanded the resignation of Prime Minister, but later claimed that Rajinikanth was anti-Congress because he had whole heartedly supported Anna Hazare’s movement.

“LOL! So what? It’s either Congress or Anna in that case. Where is BJP?” Congress leader Rajiv Shukla demonstrated the effect of his statement.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rajini-250x178.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-claims-party-symbol-is-hand-of-rajinikanth-2317,Congress leader claims party symbol is hand of Rajinikanth,,1335600407.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/communists-not-to-get-a-railway-berth-next-to-a-non-communist-2307,"New Delhi. Railway Minister Mukul Roy has announced a new feature in train ticket booking that will protect a Trinamool Congress worker from being allotted a berth next to a CPM supporter. The feature will be introduced in beta stage first on the IRCTC website next week, and would soon be implemented on all ticket counters of the Indian Railways.

“We have to make sure that an aam aadmi, especially a Trinamool Congress supporter, doesn’t end up befriending a communist during a train journey,” Railway Minister explained the rationale behind the decision.

Earlier, Trinamool Congress had called for a social boycott of CPM supporters. The party had asked its members not to marry into families supporting CPM, in fact, not to be even friends with a communist.

There was a risk of ‘sleeping with the enemy’ if the co-passenger in the train turned out to be a communist, TMC sources say.

Following this instruction, Trinamool MP and former TV quiz-master Derek O’ Brien had declared, during an interview on a national television news channel, that he would not sit next to an MP belonging to the Left parties in the Parliament.

Sources say that Mukul Roy heard the statement on TV and decided to extend the logic to seating arrangements in the Railways.

“There is a race to impress Mamata Di among the Trinamool MPs; maybe with an exception of Dinesh Trivedi,” a source said, “The decision of Mukul Roy has to be seen in this light.”

After consulting party members and software experts, Mukul Roy is believed to have ordered changes in the IRCTC website. Now a person would be asked to fill up his political affiliation while booking a train ticket.

“Just like currently they ask you to indicate your food preferences in terms of ‘veg’ or ‘non-veg’ while booking a Rajdhani or Shatabdi ticket, you will be asked about your political preference in terms of ‘left’ or ‘non-left’ while booking tickets in any reserved class,” a source informed.

Passengers with left leanings will be allotted berths together, and it would be made sure that no one with non-left political leanings gets to sit next to a left leaning passenger.

“The same rule will apply in cases of ticket upgrade or RAC (reservation against cancellation). In fact, people won’t be allowed to exchange berths if the action ends up putting a communist next to a non-communist,” Mukul Roy explained the benefits of the new feature.

When asked why he was assuming that every non-communist would like to avoid contacts with a communist, the Railway Minister said that it was a decision that couldn’t be rolled back.

“Didi approves it, and this is for aam aadmi’s better future and welfare,” he said.

For the non-reserved class, a special coach for communists, with 24 berths and without any toilet or basic amenities like fans, could be attached to trains, unconfirmed sources tell Faking News.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-unmarried-due-to-coalition-politics-he-had-cpm-girlfriend-2299,"New Delhi. One of the best kept secrets of India is out – sources tell Faking News that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has not married due to compulsions of coalition politics. Rahul had a Bengali girlfriend but he couldn’t marry her as her family members were traditional CPM supporters, and any such attempt would have meant Mamata Banerjee ending the coalition with Congress in West Bengal.

“Rahul ji sacrificed his personal choices over public welfare,” a Congress leader from West Bengal told Faking News on conditions of anonymity, “Bidya was a very good girl, but her father and brothers were hardcore CPM supporters.”

Earlier, there were rumors that Rahul Gandhi had a Columbian girlfriend.

Bidya Bagchi, the alleged Bengali girlfriend of Rahul Gandhi, is now happily married into a CPM family in Kerala, sources inform. She waited for Rahul till as late as 2009, the last general elections.

“When results were announced and left parties faced a huge setback, Bidya asked Rahul one last time if he could marry her,” a source informed, “Rahul is believed to have asked her mother, who in turn decided to have a word with Mamata Didi.”

Mamata’s party Trinamool Congress had appeared as the second largest party in the UPA coalition and her support was crucial to the formation of a Congress-led government at the center.

“Mamata Di asked Sonia ji to choose between bahu (daughter-in-law) and bahumat (majority in the Parliament),” the source revealed.

Sources say that Sonia Gandhi tried her best but Mamata refused to relent. She openly threatened to walk out of UPA if Rahul was married into a CPM family.

“The pressure on Rahul Gandhi was increasing as his much younger cousin Varun Gandhi was also planning to marry a Bengali bride, whom he later married,” the source explained the complex socio-political equations behind the wedding.

Finally, Rahul Gandhi had to bow before Mamata’s diktat and drop his wedding plans to save the UPA-II government.

“Even we didn’t know this fact,” a Congress leader told Faking News when asked for a comment, “The respect for Rahul Baba has grown many times now! He deserves Bharat Ratna!”

However, skeptics in the opposition camp have rubbished the whole story and dubbed it as yet another attempt by Congress to blame its own shortcomings on its allies.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rahul_gandhi-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-unmarried-due-to-coalition-politics-he-had-cpm-girlfriend-2299,"Rahul Gandhi unmarried due to coalition politics, he had CPM girlfriend",,1334650298.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-to-sell-all-mayawati-statutes-to-wb-after-modifying-into-mamata-banerjee-2295,"Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh has decided to earn some revenues through sale of Mayawati statues that have been lying unused after a new government was formed by Samajwadi Party last month. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had earlier promised not to demolish the statues, has ordered the statues to be altered a little and turned into statues of Mamata Banerjee. These modified statues would be subsequently sold to West Bengal.

“There are many similarities between Mayawati and Mamata – their names start with the same letter, both are nicknamed ‘sister’ i.e. Behenji and Didi respectively, both are unmarried, both run their respective political parties like private business, and both hate red color of their political opponents,” Gurunath Murthy, a senior bureaucrat in UP told Faking News.

Kolkata could be soon full of such statues of Mamata Banerjee

Sources say that UP officials got this idea after a professor in West Bengal was arrested for forwarding a cartoon of Mamata Banerjee. This reminded them of the incident where four school children were arrested in UP for damaging a poster of Mayawati.

“While Behenji had ordered release of the schoolboys, Didi justified the arrest – this reinforced our belief that Mamata Di could love something like her own statues installed in Kolkata; maybe she’d not even need an excuse like Mayawati ji that Kanshi Ram had it in his will,” Murthy claimed.

Convinced of West Bengal’s Chief Minister’s love for herself, the officials in UP suggested Akhilesh Yadav to sell off all the statutes of Mayawati to Mamata Banerjee, to which the young CM immediately agreed.

Sources say that sculptors were straightaway kidnapped from their homes and brought to the capital to prepare an execution plan for alteration of the statues from Mayawati’s to Mamata’s.

Sculptors are reported to have said that they could easily clip off the handbags and change the facial features of the statues to suit the needs, but the biggest problem was altering the salwaar-kameez of Mayawati into Bengali saari of Mamata. Sculptors warned that if salwaar-kameez was given shape of a saari, it might start looking like the dresses worn by cheerleaders of the Kolkata Knight Riders.

“That could have angered Mamata Banerjee and her supporters, causing fissures in the federal structure of India,” Murthy said, “But fortunately we had a solution ready; we decided to use all the cloth that was used by the Election Commission to cover Mayawati and Elephant statues. We will make saari out of those covers.”

Faking News thought of contacting Mamata Banerjee’s office for a comment, but we were reminded of the jokes we had cracked on Didi, so we dropped the idea.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mamata_Statue-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-to-sell-all-mayawati-statutes-to-wb-after-modifying-into-mamata-banerjee-2295,UP to sell all Mayawati’s statutes to WB after modifying them into Mamata’s,,1334338709.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalitha-cancels-all-marriages-solemnized-under-dmk-regime-2056,"Chennai. In a shocking development, though perfectly in keeping with the trend of reversing and scrapping the schemes and decisions of the previous DMK regime, Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa has announced that all the marriages that took place during the DMK rule will be “null and void”.

“Those who got married during the Karunanidhi’s rule were blind to the reality and our government has decided to give them an opportunity to mend their mistake,” an official press release said, “Those who think they were right can remarry; there will a single-window counter for such couples.”

Expectedly, the decision is being opposed by DMK, which called it draconian and undemocratic. In a response striking similar to that of his father and former CM Karunanidhi, party’s heir-apparent M K Stalin said, “Being unmarried, Jaya does not understand the sanctity and value of marriage. No one is a bigger authority on marriages than my father.”

Jayalalithaa signals end to DMK marriages

The DMK is reported to be considering moving the Chennai High Court challenging the decision. It hopes the court would declare the move “ultra vires”. Party has also asked the central government to impose President’s rule in the state.

Congress is playing it safe as the party doesn’t want to offend Jayalalithaa so soon. However, Congress leaders are trying their best to help DMK.

“There was no need for this order by the Jaya government,” Union Minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal argued, “As per my calculations, the number of marriages held under the DMK rule is ‘zero’. There were only notional nuptial knots. There is no need to cancel any.”

Sibal hotly contested the figures released by the marriage bureau attached to the Ministry of Social Welfare and dubbed those figures as “presumptive”, and “figments of AIADMK’s imagination”.

The decision is also being opposed by lawyers, in-laws, and religious leaders, who think that Jayalalithaa is trying to intrude into their respective and reserved domains.

But some reports suggest that many men were happy and joyous after the announcement.

“I didn’t vote for Amma in the assembly elections, but this is too good!” Karthik Murali, a software engineer who got married in 2009, welcomed the decision. Kathik also canceled the order for a diamond-studded gold necklace that he had booked just a couple of hours back to please his perpetually angry wife.

While women are divided over the issue, women organizations have all opposed the move and asked Jaya to take back the order. “It’s true that we love it when women call off marriages, but this is a bit too far,” a women rights activist told Faking News.

After differences appeared in Team Anna over Prashant Bhushan’s remarks on Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati has suggested Anna to replace Prashant Bhushan with her statue in his team. Mayawati claims that the move will balance the composition of Team Anna and will make sure that corruption is rooted out forever from the country.

“My statue will be more valuable than Prashant Bhushan,” Mayawati declared while showering flowers on her own statue in Noida, where she had gone to inaugurate the Rs. 685 crore park, “No one will dare to speak anything against the statue, let alone daring to slap it.”

“Also, it will make sure that dalit views are represented in the Lokpal committee,” she added, “Team Anna doesn’t have a dalit member and it’s the right opportunity to correct that mistake.”

One of them could become Lokpal

Mayawati claimed that her statue was more capable of representing and defending dalit interests than any lawyer, politician, or activist in the country.

“If Anna Hazare is not anti-dalit, he should immediately include my statue no. 420235 in his team,” she demanded, referring to a statue of herself that she had handpicked to draft the Lokpal bill.

Many pro-Mayawati thinkers have supported the demands by UP CM citing the fact that Mayawati statues were now an integral part of India. Many of them even suggested that one of these Mayawati statues could later be appointed the first Lokpal of India.

“You can’t imagine the socio-political landscape of India without a Mayawati statue holding a handbag in the backdrop,” Suryabhan Misra, a pro-Mayawati journalist argued, “If we can have a puppet Prime Minister, what’s wrong with having a statue Lokpal?”

“If we have a Mayawatiji’s statue as Lokpal, it will also give the post of Lokpal the much needed statue-tory status,” Suryabhan said, making a reference to Rahul Gandhi’s demand of making Lokpal a constitutional or statutory body. He was apparently not joking.

Some independent experts also believe that having a Mayawati statue in Team Anna could actually prove to be beneficial for Anna, as he can then reject every criticism of his actions for being a conspiracy against dalits of India.

Faking News tried to reach members of Team Anna to get a response but they refused to comment over Mayawati’s demands. Meanwhile unconfirmed sources suggest that Maywati has also asked BJP leader LK Advani to install one of her statues on his Rath while it’s in Uttar Pradesh, so that the message against corruption is delivered effectively to the masses.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Mayawati_statues-250x208.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-demands-replacing-prashant-bhushan-with-her-statue-in-team-anna-2016,Mayawati demands replacing Prashant Bhushan with her statue in Team Anna,,1318597687.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A team of doctors and psychiatrists from Hisar Pagalkhana (Mental Asylum) have given a clean chit to senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh in the suspected case of him being a mental patient. While doctors have certified that Digvijay Singh was not suffering from any mental illness, they have expressed concerns over the wellbeing of the Congress General Secretary as he was found to be suffering from a rare disorder called “Digvijay Singh”.

“He is not pagal (mad),” declared Dr. Hariram Bishnoi, bringing relief to the Faking News correspondent.

“But he is suffering from Digvijay Singh,” he added, “It is a recent phenomenon and researchers all over the world are trying to study the causes and effects of this ailment. We would soon come with the details of this ailment and a medical name for it. For now, we are calling it ‘Digvijay Singh’.”

Digvijay Singh coming out happy after getting a clean chit from psychiatrists

Both Digvijay Singh (the human being) and social activist Anna Hazare had gone to Hisar Mental Asylum after the congress leader challenged Anna on Sunday to accompany him to a hospital and get their brains checked.

Anna took up this challenge yesterday itself and both of them visited Hisar Pagalkhana early today morning.

“Anna was discharged in fifteen minutes as no major symptoms of any mental illness were found,” Dr. Bishnoi informed, “However Digvijay Singh kept on pointing fingers at Anna and yelling ‘Gandhigiri karta hai, chemical locha hai,’ all the while we were examining Anna.”

“We had tough time concentrating on our work while Diggi Raja spoke,” another member of the team that diagnosed both Anna Hazare and Digvijay Singh, said on conditions of anonymity.

After discharging Anna, the team of doctors and psychiatrists then examined Digvijay Singh. Anna Hazare didn’t point fingers or yell at Digvijay Singh all this while, but he gave four interviews to various journalists in the meantime.

“Politicians are servants and the citizens are the king (neta sevak hain, janta raja hai)” Anna Hazare repeated for the estimated 5829th time during his interview, which was suddenly interrupted by Digvijay Singh.

“Main raja hoon!” Digvijay Singh, fondly known as Diggi Raja, is reported to have objected when Anna declared the citizens (janta) as king (raja) during the interview.

At this point of time, the doctors concluded that Digvijay Singh was not stark mad, but he was simply suffering from “Digvijay Singh”.

“This primarily appears like a speech disorder,” Dr. Bishnoi gave more details about Digvijay Singh (the disease).

“We will undertake more lab tests and researches. As of now, this doesn’t look like any mental illness; but we will wait before jumping to any conclusion,” he said.

Sources inform that the team of doctors and psychiatrists had earlier decided to call this peculiar speech disorder as “Diggi Raja Speech Syndrome” but decided against it as it shortened to “D-RSS”.

“It could have worsened the situation and Digvijay Singh could have turned violent,” Dr. Bishnoi explained why the team decided to drop the name “D-RSS”.

While Digvijay Singh has expressed happiness and satisfaction at being certified a non-mental patient by the doctors, he expressed fears that some doctors of the Hisar Mental Asylum could be RSS members, who gave a clean chit to Anna as well.

“I stand vindicated,” Digvijay Singh said in a press conference afterwards.

Meanwhile Congress too has expressed happiness over clean chit to Digvijay Singh and has decided not to show black flags to Advani during his latest Rath Yatra, which starts tomorrow.

“We will instead show white flags with Digvijay Singh’s face printed on them,” a party source revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Digvijay_Singh-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-diagnosed-with-a-disease-called-digvijay-singh-2010,Digvijay Singh diagnosed with a disease called Digvijay Singh,,1318239241.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After the controversial 2G note matter was closed in a 10-minutes press briefing on Thursday, government has decided to close the larger matter of 2G scam itself and put a conclusive end to the whole affair. After consulting various ministers and advisors, the UPA government has announced that it will officially close the matter of 2G scam on Dussehra, which is less than a week away.

“The views expressed by the CAG in their report are not their own,” Union Minister Kapil Sibal explained why the government thought that the matter should be closed.

Prime Minister is reported to have given green signal to the whole proposal

“Recent reports have suggested that initially an internal audit by CAG had put the notional loss in the 2G spectrum allocation case to a much lower figure, which was overturned by the CAG headquarters,” Sibal explained, “This clearly shows that the CAG report doesn’t reflect the views of the CAG as an institution, much like the 2G note didn’t reflect the views of the government.”

Drawing parallels between the 2G note and the CAG report, Kapil Sibal further said that both the documents were just a “routine” communication between various government agencies, which were misreported widely by the media and misinterpreted by the public.

“Fortunately, under the able guidance of Madam Gandhi, we could close the matter around the 2G note,” he said, “And now is the turn of the CAG report – a matter that will be closed for good on the auspicious day of Dussehra.”

Sibal refused to divulge the details on how the government intends to close the matter, but sources tell Faking News that the process might not take more than 10 minutes, as was the case with closure of the matter arising out the 2G note.

“I think they are going to make a Raavan effigy out of the CAG report on Dusshera and Rahul Gandhi, acting as Lord Rama, will burn down the effigy with a burning arrow made out of the CBI charge-sheet,” Ravindra Chaudhary, an expert visualized the closure of the 2G spectrum allocation scam.

On being asked why he thinks Congress could take help of religious symbols, which almost makes it appear like the BJP, Ravindra said, “Congress has been claiming that they just followed the policy of the BJP government in the 2G spectrum allocation, so I guess they’d do the same even while closing this matter.”

However Congress has rejected such visualizations as figment of imagination of a few people and has blamed the BJP for spreading misinformation.

“All I want to say right now is that there was no scam. There was no loss and no rules were broken,” Kapil Sibal reiterated, “I am happy that the matter will be closed.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-metro-announces-special-line-to-10-janpath-for-vips-1992,"New Delhi. Realizing that there has been an increased flow of VIP traffic to 10 Janpath in the recent days, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has announced a special “10 Janpath Express Line” for speedy commuting to and from the residence of UPA Chairperson and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

This will be the second special line added by DMRC after it inaugurated “Airport Express Line” early this year, which takes just 18 minutes to reach Indira Gandhi International Airport from the New Delhi Railway Station.

“10 Janpath line should not take more than 15 minutes from Airport. Various leaders and dignitaries will save time by straightaway boarding the Metro to Soniaji’s residence without worrying about the road traffic,” a DMRC official informed, “Not only Airport, the line will connect 7 RCR and the Parliament building to 10 Janpath as well.”

Power in her hands?

“We hope that this project will be completed in the next six months,” the official added. DMRC is hopeful that things won’t change much in the next six months and the traffic to 10 Janpath will only go up in this duration.

“What could happen even in the extreme case? Maybe Manmohan Singh ji resigns and Rahul Gandhi ji takes over? That will only increase the traffic to 10 Janpath, no? Surely BJP is not coming to power anytime soon; they are more interested in riding a Rath than Metro!” a DMRC source said.

The proposed line will be called the “White Line” as most of the VIPs are expected to be wearing spotless white kurta-paijama when visiting 10 Janpath.

There won’t be any “VIP pass” for this route for obvious reasons; however, DMRC has rejected demands for an “aam aadmi pass” on this route.

“The common man still stands to benefit because the traffic on the roads would be normal after VIPs start traveling in a special metro line. No security checks, no barricades, no diversions – what more does an aam aadmi want?” a DMRC official argued.

When asked if journalists could be given free passes for the route, the DMRC official said that the matter would be decided by the Delhi government. When Faking News team approached Delhi government, we were chased away as the government had sanctioned freebies only for non-FN journalists.

DMRC refused to give details of fare charges for this upcoming line and avoided questions on whether VIPs will be frisked at the entrance. However sources indicate that the fare could be heavily subsidized and the line will have facilities like tasty food, exotic beverages, and beautiful rail hostesses.

“All those air hostesses and beer bottles laid off by Vijay Mallya after he shut down his Kingfisher Red could be accommodated in the Delhi Metro White Line,” a source told Faking News.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sonia_metro-223x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/delhi-metro-announces-special-line-to-10-janpath-for-vips-1992,Delhi Metro announces special line to 10 Janpath for VIPs,,1317280163.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-misplaces-clean-chit-sonia-gandhi-gave-him-1986,"New Delhi. This act of carelessness can cost the Home Minister dearly if his careless attitude towards internal security didn’t cost him anything. P Chidambaram has misplaced the “clean chit” that Congress President and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi had given him yesterday during his 15-minutes meeting on the issue of Finance Ministry note by Pranab Mukherjee, which appeared to implicate him in the 2G spectrum allocation scam.

“Look beneath the sofa; it’s white in color,” Chidambaram was seen hurriedly and worriedly ordering his housekeeping staff, who searched every nook and corner of his official residence to find the now missing “clean chit”.

Chidambaram in a jolly mood last night

“Sir was in very good mood last night when he came back home; he was singing Benny Lava song flashing a piece of paper in his hand,” Gangubai, the senior most member of the housekeeping staff described the scenes of the last evening when Chidambaram came back home after meeting Sonia Gandhi.

“He switched on the television where news channels were discussing what could have transpired in the meetings,” Gangubai further recalled, “He was smiling and suddenly he burst into laughter, waving his piece of paper towards the television screen, yelling – this, this, you biatches!”

Chidambaram reportedly turned off the television when he saw a small report on death of Rajbala, a Baba Ramdev follower who was injured during Ramlila Maidan crackdown in June early this year.

“Good lord, the news has been lost in the whole speculation over 2G note and meetings; perhaps Pranabda is not so bad,” he is alleged to have muttered to himself before going to have a peaceful and sound sleep.

This morning, when he was supposed to hand out the “clean chit” to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is returning to India after speaking at UN, Chidambaram found to his horror that the chit was missing. He frantically searched everywhere but couldn’t find the prized possession.

“He even called up Subramanian Swamy and asked if he had broken into his house last night,” a close aide of Chidambaram told Faking News, “Swamy is reported to have denied the allegations and asked Chidambaram to check if his house was bugged like Pranab Mukherjee’s office.”

“Swamy seemed to suggest that there was someone who was keeping an eye over both Chidambaram and Pranab, and manipulating them to his or her own advantage,” Chidambaram’s aide explained.

Not interested in pondering over conspiracy theories, the Home Minister is reported to have tried calling up everyone, including Digvijay Singh, to get help on the missing “clean chit”, but of no help.

Experts believe that Chidambaram could be in deep trouble if he fails to find the missing chit before Manmohan Singh returns back to India later tonight.

“He better finds it by tomorrow morning and hands it over to the Prime Minister, who will then hand it over to the CBI,” an expert said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/P-Chidambaram-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-misplaces-clean-chit-sonia-gandhi-gave-him-1986,Chidambaram misplaces “clean chit” Sonia Gandhi gave him,,1317113302.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-told-to-launch-a-regional-party-so-that-2g-scam-can-be-fully-blamed-on-allies-1973,"New Delhi. Congress sources suggest that the party has asked Home Minister P Chidambaram to resign from the party and re-launch his regional political party Congress Jananayaka Peravai (Congress Democratic Front), which he had founded in 2001 after breaking away from Tamil Maanila Congress, which itself was a party formed after breaking away from Congress in Tamil Nadu.

The “advice” to Chidambaram was given after a “secret” note written by Finance Ministry appeared to implicate the Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum scam by arguing that Chidambaram, the then Finance Minister, could have insisted on competitive allocation of spectrum and nipped the malpractices in the bud.

Chidambaram is still thinking what to do

“Congress doesn’t want to have any of its leaders name coming up in the 2G scam,” a party source told Faking News, “DMK has been the party to be blamed for it, and if Chidambaram is made a co-accused in the case, he’d be asked to form his own party and become a UPA ally.”

“We want to have a clean image, like Dr. Manmohan Singh’s,” the Congress source clarified.

With Subramanian Swamy on a mission to make Chidambaram a co-accused in the case, Congress is taking no chances and has asked the Home Minister to make all arrangements to regroup his former regional party, which he had merged with Congress after the 2004 general elections.

“Yes, it was a mistake,” the Congress source referred to the merger, “I think we should have taken in his party as an ally; just like we treat Sharad Pawar’s party, another breakaway Congress party. Imagine if NCP (Pawar’s party) is merged with Congress! Oh God!”

The source refused to divulge the relationship Congress will have with Chidambaram’s regional party (if and when it’s re-formed), but he said that the party will be an important ally of the UPA so that communal forces led by BJP don’t come back to power at center.

“Congress is completely against corruption and we have taken all steps to check it. But people have to understand that there are compulsions of coalition politics,” the Congress source repeated what Rahul Gandhi had said early this year.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Chidambaram-224x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-told-to-launch-a-regional-party-so-that-2g-scam-can-be-fully-blamed-on-allies-1973,Chidambaram told to launch a regional party so that 2G scam can be fully blamed on allies,,1316688108.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/controversy-over-narendra-modi-refusal-to-wear-birthday-cap-1969,"Ahmedabad. The nation was shocked to see Narendra Modi refusing to wear a colorful conical cap that is widely worn by children on birthdays. The cap, along with some balloons and a birthday whistle, was offered by a child to Modi during his sadbhavna fast, but the Chief Minister of Gujarat refused to put them on and instead chose to accept a small cake from the kid.

“He said he was too old for these things,” recalled Pappu, the child who offered the birthday paraphernalia to Modi. Video clips from the sadbhavna fast clearly showed that Modi had politely refused to wear the cap or hold the balloons, even as Pappu took out the birthday whistle and cake for the Chief Minister who had started the sadbhavna fast on his birthday.

“If Modi really loves children, why can’t he dress up like this on his birthday?” ask critics.

Sources inform that Narendra Modi was not interested at all in Pappu’s way of celebrating birthdays, but he finally agreed to take a small bite off the cake as a token of appreciation. The partial acceptance of his wishes confused Pappu, who was later reported by news channels as being livid with what he termed as an “insult to childhood”.

This whole affair, which took place on the last day of Narendra Modi’s fast yesterday, is slowly growing into a major political controversy with Congress accusing Modi of having insulted the future citizens of India i.e. the children.

“Not only has he insulted our future generation, he has also shown scant respect for the feelings of the innocent child who had gone there to greet him,” state Congress leader Shankarsinh Waghela said, “I appeal to all the children of this country to support Congress, the party of Chacha Nehru, who loved children.”

BJP on the other hand has tried to play down the issue and has claimed that Modi had never won anything like that before, not even a dunce cap in his school.

“Furthermore, his birthday was on Saturday, not on Monday when he was offered those stuffs,” BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad justified Modi’s conduct, “And why can’t you media guys appreciate the fact that he accepted the cake. That shows he respected the sentiments and trusted the kid. He didn’t bother to check if the cake was poisoned, as is done by other leaders before eating food.”

Children of India, who are not yet eligible to vote in the elections and thus form a vote-bank, have refused to comment on the issue, though they claimed that they were finding the controversy a bit “childish”.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narendra_modi_birthday-187x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/controversy-over-narendra-modi-refusal-to-wear-birthday-cap-1969,Controversy over Narendra Modi’s refusal to wear birthday cap and hold balloons,,1316507417.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-claims-victory-over-narendra-modi-fast-using-duckworth-lewis-method-1961,"Ahmedabad. On a day when both Congress and BJP leaders sat on their respective fasts in Gujarat, it was but natural that the whole affair would become competitive in nature, with each side claiming victory at the end of three days. However, Congress has claimed victory on the first day itself citing provisions offered in the Duckworth-Lewis method, which is used to decide a winning team if a limited over cricket match is curtained due to rains or bad light.

“It is raining in Ahmedabad these days and we realized that rains could stop the fasts anytime soon,” Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela said, who had announced a “counter fast” after BJP leader and Chief Minister Narendra Modi announced his three-day fast for peace and harmony in the state.

“We had done our homework and we decided to stay ahead on all the vital parameters that an expert could factor in to decide the winner, once rains interrupted and stopped the fasts,” Vaghela revealed the strategy Congress has been adopting to defeat Modi in Gujarat all these years.

Many commentators have referred to the ongoing fasts by BJP and Congress as GPL – Gujarat Premier League

Finally, when it rained around 1.11 PM and both the fasts were briefly stopped to make sure political workers don’t get drenched, Congress announced that they had “won” the fasting match according to the Duckworth-Lewis method.

“We had ‘scored’ more and we had more than required ‘resources’ at our hands when rains stopped the fast,” Vaghela explained and claimed that the Duckworth-Lewis method could be applied in this case as more than four hours of competitive fasting had already taken place when rains interrupted the contest.

It should be noted that the Duckworth-Lewis method takes into account the ‘resources’ a team has at a point of time to calculate and predict team’s final score. In terms of cricket, these resources refer to ‘wickets in hand’ and ‘overs remaining’ and are applied to the score at which the game was stopped.

Congress scorers point out that since Vaghela had started his fast earlier than Modi, he was fasting on a ‘higher score’ when the fast was stopped; however there was huge controversy over the calculation of ‘resources’.

“Our fast venue was bigger and we had ACs and other grand arrangements, while he was fasting at footpath. How come he had better resources?” BJP President Nitin Gadkari disputed the claims of the Congress leader.

“Or was he referring to the Gujarat Governor as Congress resource?” he quipped, and claimed that the real winner was BJP, whether in the four-hour format or the three-day version of the contest.

Congress has rejected such criticisms and insisted that the party had many resources such as the goodwill of minorities and it indeed had won the “first round” of the fast, and would eventually win the series at the end of the third day.

With both the parties claiming victory, some journalists advised that the matter could be referred to Anna Hazare, who is seen as an expert on fasts. But sources suggest that Anna refused to step in and play third-umpire in this particular case.

However, both the parties agree that their stances didn’t amount to any mockery of fasting.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Duckworth-Lewis_Modi-Rahul-225x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-claims-victory-over-narendra-modi-fast-using-duckworth-lewis-method-1961,Congress claims victory over Narendra Modi’s fast using Duckworth-Lewis method,,1316245293.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ship-carrying-sharad-pawar-undisclosed-assets-gets-stuck-at-juhu-beach-1953,"Mumbai. A huge merchant ship, carrying massive amount of valuables, has drifted ashore and got stuck at Juhu beach, making it the third ship in the last three months to have met such fate. Even though the government officials have declined to comment over the ownership of the ship or the cargo, sources tell us that the ship, along with the goods, is owned by union minister Sharad Pawar, who had earlier declared his total assets as being 12 crore rupees only.

“The ship was carrying all those remaining assets, which were not declared by Pawar earlier,” a whistleblower on the ship told Faking News, “I have no idea about the final destination of the ship as everyone on the ship was supposed to be replaced by trained militia after a few days in the middle of the ocean, so that the ship is not hijacked by Somali pirates.”

Clicking pictures of the Sharad Pawar’s ship has been banned, but it apparently looks like this.

Based on this input, Faking News investigative team concluded that the ship, named Panchshil, the unsinkable, was destined to follow a route that would have made it pass through the Somali waters, which meant that the ship was either headed towards North Africa or Europe.

“Libya? Is Pawar buying oil from Gaddafi? Or maybe he is funding Gaddafi’s resistance in anticipation of some rewards and favors in the future?” an intern with Faking News argued, who was earlier the chief international correspondent with a leading news channel.

“That appears a bit farfetched,” the international desk editor rejected the intern’s idea as part of his job, “I think this ship was going to Switzerland. Swiss Bank you see.”

“Not Italy?” interjected the housekeeping guy, who was warned not to interfere in editorial work again and instead concentrate on removing the spider webs from the Library.

Even as the editorial and janitorial staff debated the destination of the ship, another “source” called up Faking News’ office and informed how the ship got stuck at the beach in the first place.

“The captain of the ship was a former truck driver, who was given the supari to kill Anna Hazare after some contract killers refused to do so,” the source revealed, “It seems that he saw some bhelpuri vendor wearing ‘I am Anna’ cap taking a walk on the beach early this morning. He mistook the vendor for Anna and the ship for a truck and tried to run over the poor guy with the speeding ship. The ship got stuck in the process.”

This theory appears convincing as the local police confirmed that the captain of the ship had been absconding ever since the ship got stuck, leaving behind huge cache of cash, jewelry, gems, gold bricks, onions, share and land registration certificates, apart from some suspected ICC cricket trophies on board.

However the police chased away our reporter when he asked if they were investigating the case from “Sharad Pawar owing the ship and the cargo” angle.

Meanwhile Faking News advises Mumbai residents not to flock to the Juhu beach again to see the ship, because this time a large number of criminals and politicians could also be there in the crowd to take a look at the ship.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/gold-ship-in-burma-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/ship-carrying-sharad-pawar-undisclosed-assets-gets-stuck-at-juhu-beach-1953,Ship carrying Sharad Pawar’s undisclosed assets gets stuck at Juhu beach,,1315980628.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/meira-kumar-opposes-ipads-demands-silencers-for-mps-1922,"New Delhi. Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar is reportedly not too excited about MPs being given iPads or other high end tablets to make parliamentary proceedings paper-free; she has demanded “silencers” for MPs instead.

“Paper is not any hindrance or problem; waste paper like the unread copies of the union budget speech can be recycled,” Ms. Kumar is supposed to have argued with the parliamentary committee that had sanctioned 50,000 rupees for each MP to buy an Apple iPad or Samsung Galaxy tab.

The Lok Sabha speaker further expressed concerns that the honorable members could download tablet applications like “Air Horn” that is used to make noisy sounds like a siren or a Vuvuzela, and disturb the parliamentary proceedings whenever they disagree with a point being made.

Meira Kumar, apparently showing the way out to a noisy MP, but the MP went on to make a statement that was later removed from the parliament records (paper archives).

“These tablets are not going to cure my headache,” Meira Kumar had complained to the committee and asked them to drop plans of giving high-end communication gadgets to the MPs.

Ms. Kumar, who is often heard saying “baith jaaiye, shaant ho jaaiye” (please sit down, please keep quiet), has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Minister to find out if “silencers” could be given to the MPs during parliamentary proceedings.

“Some gadget that could be made compulsory for each MP to wear whenever he or she enters the parliamentary premises,” Ms. Kumar is said to have proposed.

“They could be like a helmet or a gas-mask in shape, but would make the area around the mouth air-tight,” she explained her vision of the urgently required gadget for the MPs, “There would be provision allowing them to breathe by letting fresh air go in, but I should have the control to stop the air from vocal chords from coming out.”

Although “human silencers” are not currently available for use by the masses, experts believe that a modified version of what astronauts wear when going into outer space could be designed for the MPs to make parliamentary proceedings smoother and more meaningful.

“It could cost more than a tablet, but I guess the results would be to the effect as desired by the Madam Speaker,” an expert argued and claimed that Meira Kumar’s suggestion could be implemented if there was enough “political will”.

Meanwhile unconfirmed reports suggest that China has already produced around thousand cheap iPads and is planning flood markets in New Delhi around the Parliament.

“They are even offering fake bills to the extent of 50,000 rupees,” a man dealing with fake Chinese goods claimed.

Starting today, Google is planning to use the ever growing statues in the state for the benefit of aam aadmi.

“We have launched our services in Beta stage in Lucknow and we hope to extend these services all over the state once the Indian courts give green signal to Miss Mayawati for completing her statue building projects,” Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Faking News.

Sources inform that a “statue predictor algorithm” designed by Google engineers had estimated that Lucknow would have a Mayawati statue after every hundred feet by the year 2020.

“This is huge! We don’t even expect street lights or traffic signals cropping up at similar rates; nothing could give a sense of direction in the state better than the statues, and that’s why we decided to incorporate them into our services,” Google CEO explained.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati with statues that would give directions to the lost citizens in the state

The news has brought an early Diwali for Maya’s supporters in the state capital, and even the Chief Minister herself was happy with the announcement.

“We thank Maanniya Google Ji for taking this noble step that will help the poor people in Uttar Pradesh,” Mayawati read out a prepared statement in a press conference. Later her Chief Secretary informed that the government will provide the required data to Google engineers, and the statues would be meticulously numbered in order to make direction-giving easy and accurate.

Government sources inform that the news has excited Behenji so much that she is planning to build a statue of herself that would be the tallest in the world.

“Taller than the Christ the Redeemer and the Statue of Liberty put together,” a government source informed. Faking News learnt that this proposed tallest statue of Mayawati would be called the “Redeemer of Poverty” symbolizing Maya’s constant concern for the poor.

Besides, the statue will have Mayawati holding an elephant in her right arm, instead of the customary torch. “This is to symbolize her power and stature,” explained the source.

This decision, as expected, hasn’t gone down well with the Samajwadi Party leaders who have vowed to demolish the statue once they come back to power, even if that means partnering with the BJP for the demolition, while Congress workers are reportedly working on a “counter offensive”.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-confuses-sonia-gandhi-remote-control-with-magic-wand-1902,"New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who had revealed on Independence Day that there was no “magic wand” against corruption, was momentarily excited earlier today when he mistook Sonia Gandhi’s “remote control” for being some kind of a magic wand.

Dr. Singh was exposed to the remote control during a meeting with Rahul Gandhi that took place to discuss the issues arising out of Anna Hazare’s indefinite fast.

“What is that?” Prime Minister is reported to have asked Rahul Gandhi, who was holding a strange looking gadget in his hand. Rahul was given the gadget – the remote control – by his mother when she had to leave India for medical treatment a few weeks back.

“Oh, this thing? I don’t know what is it called, but mom says she can get whatever she wants using this,” Rahul replied to a bewildered Manmohan Singh and other cabinet ministers who had come to his residence for the secret meeting after skipping breakfast early this morning.

“You mean some kind of magic wand!?” Dr. Singh asked with a clear but rare excitement in his tone.

“I don’t know,” Rahul said, “Although even I wanted to know more and use this thing myself, Mom says that I may not need it at all after a couple of years!”

The remote-control that was mistaken for being a magic-wand by the Prime Minister

“But I think you are right; it might be a magic wand,” the young Gandhi added as an afterthought.

“Could this be the magic wand that Pranab da wanted to control inflation with, or is this the magic wand Pawar was looking for to stop farmers’ suicides and rise in onion prices?” Manmohan Singh thought, “Or maybe it’s the magic wand needed to fight terrorists that Chidambaram needs. Or please god, let it be the magic wand with which I could control corruption!”

Excited over the wide-ranging prospects this magic wand could attain, Prime Minister is reported to have implored the Congress General Secretary to let him use the magic wand for once and clear the mess that has been created in the country over the last couple of years.

After some initial hesitation, Rahul Gandhi agreed to allow use of the supposed “magic wand”, but nobody present in the meeting knew how to operate it. Since it was night time in the USA, where Sonia Gandhi was recuperating and possibly sleeping at that time, calling up the UPA chairperson for help was ruled out.

Sources inform that Sharad Pawar was the first one who offered to operate the wand, but he kept on waving it like a cricket bat and exclaiming “no more suicides”. It was not clear whether he was making a wish for the farmers or the Indian cricketers in England. Frustrated by his acts, Manmohan Singh ordered him to hand over the wand to Pranab Mukherjee.

The Union Finance Minister is believed to have taken a long drawn look at the wand, perhaps hoping that the wand would operate itself. P Chidambaram too joined him and they took turns to take a look at the supposed wand but neither of them did anything.

Finally, Prime Minister took the wand in his own hands, and he could see a big red button that said “push and order”. He wondered what why were his cabinet colleagues clueless about this.

“Fill the stomach of the old man and let his hunger and frail health vanish till the next general elections,” Manmohan Singh wished for Anna Hazare as he pressed the button.

To his surprise, Manmohan Singh found a sensation in his stomach and in his limbs soon after. Even though he had skipped breakfast, Dr. Singh no longer felt the urge to have food and he almost felt like running around in excitement. He realized that the changes he had wished for Hazare, had been implemented on himself. He realized it was the famed “remote control” and not any “magic wand”.

“There is no magic wand to fight corruption, please help us deal with the situation,” Prime Minister is later said to have requested Anna Hazare in another letter after the meeting.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/magic_wand_remote_control-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-confuses-sonia-gandhi-remote-control-with-magic-wand-1902,Manmohan Singh confuses Sonia Gandhi’s “remote control” with “magic wand”,,1314254779.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Anna Hazare’s demand of having Rahul Gandhi as the mediator for talks between his team and the government has been accepted by the Congress general secretary and the young Gandhi has come up with a compromise formula that he believes will satisfy all the participants in the ongoing debate over Lokpal.

Rahul Gandhi has proposed two Lokpals for the two Indias that he had discovered earlier.

“The civil society led by Anna wants one Lokpal while the civil society led by Aruna Roy wants five Lokpals; I believe two Lokpals is what they should settle for, for Anna’s team has the upper hand right now,” Rahul Gandhi showed his prowess as a mediator.

Rahul later clarified that the two Lokpals would respectively cater to the two Indias or the two Hindustans that he and many others have talked about earlier.

“One for the rich and the other one for the poor,” Rahul hastily clarified lest journalists, especially those belonging to Faking News, interpret the two Indias as one where the politicians lived and another where the common man lived.

Among the other solutions offered by Rahul Gandhi included a dice throwing game where a numbered clause each from the three Lokpal bill drafts – by Team Anna, by Team Aruna, and by Team Karuna UPA – will be chosen as per the number dice shows. Clauses thus chosen will be compiled and incorporated in the final draft of the bill that will be presented in the parliament.

However sources say that this solution has been rejected by Team Anna. “They continue to be dictatorial and pig-headed and are not listening to our sane suggestions,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari, speaking from an undisclosed location, complained about Team Anna on conditions of anonymity.

But it appears that Team Anna is willing to experiment with the two Lokpal solutions by Rahul Gandhi, even as stalemate continues on how to define and recognize the two Indias.

While Anna Hazare wants the two Indians to be divided among bribe-takers and bribe-givers, Congress wants it to be divided into Gujarat and Non-Gujarat. BJP was not able to present its point of view on the issue but the party demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Many others too have joined the debate with Arundhati Roy demanding the two Indias to be divided in Corporates and Non-Corporates, while Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid wants one Lokpal for those who chant Vande Mataram and another for those who can’t.

Congress leader Manish Tewari has announced that he would be moving around in the streets of Delhi with a light-bulb to oppose Team Anna’s call to switch off lights between 8-9 PM tonight in support of Jan Lokpal Bill. Tewari has expressed hope and confidence that many more Congress leaders and activists would join him with lighted bulbs and tube-lights and defeat the nefarious designs of the “A Company”.

“Thousands of bulbs would come out and expose Anna,” Manish Tewari announced in a press conference holding out a 60-watt lighted light-bulb. The Congress spokesman further claimed that the call to switch off lights for an hour was “unconstitutional”.

Manish Tewari shows his weapon against Anna

Sources suggest that Tewari, a lawyer by profession, chose light-bulbs over traditional candle-lights as a mode of protest to differentiate himself from Anna supporters, who usually take out candle-light marches.

“It’s also raining in Delhi today so candle flames could get doused off,” a close aide of Manish Tewari explained the lucid thinking and strategizing skills of the Congress leader, who is climbing up the Congress ranks with a speed inversely proportional to the speed of his speech delivery.

Tewari was joined by Kapil Sibal and Digvijay Singh at the press conference, who declared that their supporters would come up with thousands of bright bulbs and tube-lights aimed at outshining Anna Hazare’s campaign.

“Anna is spreading darkness but Congress will show the light,” Sibal said.

Sibal also said that Congress workers will move around with light-bulbs in every locality of Delhi as it was the fundamental right of a citizen to protest.

Sibal also ridiculed Anna’s idea of switching off lights.

“Can he guarantee that it will end corruption?” Sibal asked.

Digvijay Singh also said something.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kapil-sibal-appointed-head-of-cag-congress-against-graft-1859,"New Delhi. Embarrassed by one CAG report after another accusing its leaders of corruption, Congress has decided to form its own CAG – Congress Against Graft. Senior party leader and union telecom minister Kapil Sibal will head the new CAG and will come up with reports that will counter and invalidate the findings in the reports published by the current CAG – Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

“We realized that the CAG reports were increasingly getting stupid day by day,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewary told Faking News, “We fully agree with A Raja’s view that CAG is just an accountant who is legally illiterate and comes up with reports that are worthless papers. That’s why we decided to form our own CAG headed by someone who was legally literate.”

Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit was among the first one to visit Kapil Sibal to congratulate him on becoming the head of the new CAG

“And who better than Kapil Sibal?” Tewary added.

Kapil Sibal, who already has the additional responsibility of Human Resources and Development ministry, will now be given additional charge of heading the newly formed Congress Against Graft/Corruption (CAG), and will come up with the reports that will explain Congress’ official position on corruption cases, such as ‘there was zero loss to the national exchequer in the 2G spectrum scam’.

“This is a good development,” 2G spectrum scam accused Shahid Balwa’s lawyer reacted when contacted for comments, “Now I can present the new CAG report by Mr. Sibal in the court as evidence and get bail for my client. I hope Mr. Sibal can complete this report by this weekend.”

But it seems that Balwa’s lawyer will have to wait for a few weeks as the first CAG report by Sibal is believed to be focused on the Commonwealth Games scam.

“Sibal is already a member of the Group of Ministers looking into the findings of Shunglu Committee report that had earlier accused Sheila Dikshit of malpractices. He will soon come up with a report that will counter and invalidate both the (existing) CAG report and Shuglu Committee Report findings on the CWG scam,” a Delhi government spokesman confirmed.

Apart from ‘legally literate’ persons, Sibal headed CAG will also have accountants who audited Satyam’s books under Ramalinga Raju and a group of journalists to educate the common masses. Unconfirmed sources indicate that Digvijay Singh will also be a part of the new CAG.

“If everything fails, Digvijay Singh will write a report accusing the current CAG of being either anti-woman or anti-dalit, because the recent CAG reports have caused troubles to A Raja, Sheila Dikshit, and Mayawati – two women and two dalits,” a Congress source confirmed.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sibal_sheila-250x205.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/kapil-sibal-appointed-head-of-cag-congress-against-graft-1859,Kapil Sibal appointed head of CAG – Congress Against Graft,,1312793939.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pmo-role-in-2g-scam-should-be-forgiven-in-the-spirit-of-the-game-sibal-1842,"New Delhi. Union telecom minister Kapil Sibal has asked BJP leaders to take a leaf out of Indian cricket captain MS Dhoni’s book and forgive Prime Minister’s role in the spectrum scam. Dhoni had forgiven Ian Bell yesterday for assuming that the ball was dead and the umpires had called for tea break. Bell had walked off his crease and was adjudged run out as per the rules, but Dhoni reversed the decision in the spirit of the game.

Sibal says that the ‘mistake’ of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was not any graver than that of the English batsman.

“Bell was looking at the ball all along and even Prime Minister was not looking the other way,” Sibal argued, citing the PMO’s statement clarifying Manmohan Singh’s position on allotment of 2G spectrum licenses.

Sibal also made a point drawing parallels between a cricket ball and a CBI investigation

“Manmohan Singh thought that the spectrum allocation was done and over with and he could relax, and even Bell thought that the over was done with and he could walk off to have tea,” Sibal drew the parallels between the two incidents.

“Yes, technically one can drag Manmohan Singh’s name in the spectrum scam as Abhinav Mukund dragged the ball on to the stumps,” Sibal continued.

“But what about the spirit of the game?” the union minister asked with his trademark smile as he looked at all the journalists present in the press conference who seemed to agree.

The minister then asked the BJP leaders to learn a thing or two from the Indian captain who withdrew the appeal during the tea break.

“Contrast it with BJP leaders’ behavior who demanded PM’s resignation after A Raja dragged his name in the 2G scam,” Sibal said, “Is this how politics will be played in India? I hope they see the bigger picture now and withdraw their demands of PM’s resignation.”

Sibal argued that if Bell could be recalled even after umpires had ruled him out, demand for PM’s resignation can definitely be recalled, if not the cases against A Raja, in the spirit of the game.

When contacted by Faking News, BJP didn’t react to Sibal statements, but sources inform that a team of BJP leaders are planning to meet Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde to request him to withdraw his report in the spirit of the game.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kapil_sibal-250x210.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pmo-role-in-2g-scam-should-be-forgiven-in-the-spirit-of-the-game-sibal-1842,PM’s role in 2G scam should be forgiven in the “spirit of the game”: Sibal,,1312189190.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a dramatic development, BJP has offered Kapil Sibal, senior congress leader and union minister of various portfolios, to take up the job of Chief Minister of Karnataka, once BS Yeddyurappa resigns. BJP believes that after taking over from Yeddyurappa, Sibal can successfully defend the actions taken by the office of CM in the illegal mining case and pave way for return of BSY at some time in future.

“If Sibal ji wants he can join BJP, or he can act in personal capacity and take it up as an independent consulting job,” BJP President Nitin Gadkari said, “It is not at all strange for lawyers to help people from opposition parties in distress. Remember Ram Jethmalani had defended Kanimozhi even though he was a member of BJP.”

Sibal reacts after being asked if he would like to be the CM of Karnataka

“We have been forced to outsource work that our in-house lawyers have been unable to do,” BJP leader Sushma Swaraj interjected, which appeared as a veiled attack on Arun Jaitley. Gadkari later played down the statement and reiterated that the party was united on the issue of hiring Kapil Sibal.

BJP is hoping that Kapil Sibal would defend every action and decision of Karnataka CM’s office the same way as he had been defending every action of Telecom Ministry, even though A Raja is in jail for the same actions.

“We find some parallels and we believe Sibal ji can do a good job,” Gadkari explained, “There was a CAG report there and there is a Lokayukta report here, kickbacks appeared to have been paid as investment in a TV channel there and it appears to have been paid as a donation to a Trust here, and there were Maran brothers there and we have the Reddy brothers here.”

“Sibal ji has dealt with that situation and we think he can help us deal with this situation,” Gadkari said, “Even here he can argue that the BJP government was just following the policies set by the JD-S government of H D Kumaraswamy, as he has been arguing for Telecom Ministry following the ‘first come first serve’ policy set by the NDA government for 2G spectrum allocation.”

“Similar arguments can be made even in the case of land scams under Yeddyurappa government so that when BSY returns from a break, he doesn’t have to fight another battle over corruption charges,” BJP President hoped.

Kapil Sibal or Congress has not reacted to the BJP proposal but sources indicate that the two parties are warming up to the idea of helping each other in corruption cases before Anna Hazare and team restart their anti-corruption campaign after a couple of days.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Kapil_Sibal-227x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-asks-kapil-sibal-to-become-the-new-cm-of-karnataka-1830,BJP asks Kapil Sibal to become the new CM of Karnataka,,1311848635.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In an attempt to rationalize the process of political funding in India, Congress has taken a lead and announced a series of circus shows all over the country to raise funds for party expenses. Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, who had earlier likened the grand old party with a circus, has been given the charge of organizing these shows and raising money to meet the operational expenses of the party.

“We aim to fund the whole political campaign in the coming Uttar Pradesh elections through such circus shows,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari confirmed the development, “A team of chartered accountant, lawyers, and jokers would work with Mr. Tewari and plan out the whole series of circus shows.”

A proposed poster for the Congress circus shows

Although party leaders are tight lipped over the proposed events that would be portrayed in the shows, sources say that it would be like any other circus show involving acrobatics, stunts, jugglery, magic, music, and humor.

“The performers would all be Congress party members,” Tewari gave a little detail of the proposed shows but refused to divulge further, “No animals would be used for the circus shows as it’s against Indian laws.”

Mr. Tewari later quickly clarified that his statement shouldn’t be misinterpreted to mean that some members of the Congress party were animals.

Party sources inform that Rahul Gandhi could be given the role of ‘ringmaster’ for all the shows that would happen in Uttar Pradesh. This has led to a scramble among state party leaders to grab other roles for the show, even if it means roles of small clowns to support ‘the joker’.

Sources further inform that even the senior leaders of the party has been asked by the high command to take part in at least one ‘grand show’ that could take place in the national capital. P Chidambaram is rumored to take up the role of ‘tight rope walker’ in the show while Kapil Sibal will juggle at least a dozen balls going round and round in circles.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will also perform a trapeze act where he would be seen flapping his arms while being suspended in the air by a string.

The party will earn revenues through selling tickets and through corporate sponsorships, and the money thus got would be spent in fighting elections in Uttar Pradesh and for organizing other political events.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/court-orders-to-tattoo-kalmadi-body-with-cwg-scam-facts-1820,"New Delhi. After Suresh Kalmadi was diagnosed with dementia, a disorder that causes people to have memory loss, Supreme Court has ordered Tihar jail authorities to tattoo all facts and data related to the CWG scam on Kalmadi’s body. The apex court took this suo motto action based on the events portrayed in the Bollywood movie Ghajini, where Aamir Khan’s character tattoos his body with information he doesn’t want to lose.

“We can’t risk losing information related to the CWG scam like we have been losing files related to the Adarsh Housing scam,” Court said, “We can’t allow Suresh Kalmadi to forget whatever little he revealed. His confessions and statements should be finely documented and he should be constantly reminded of them, lest he goes back on them citing his mental medical condition.”

Sources reveal that Kalmadi is now planning to get infected with dyslexia, a learning disorder portrayed in the movie ‘Taare Zameen Par’, so that he fails to read the facts tattooed on his body.

Supreme Court has asked Tihar jail authorities to watch Ghajini and Memento, the Hollywood movie that originally showed a guy with a memory loss disorder, and learn finer details on “helping” such people deal with their medical condition.

“The best way out will be to log all the confessions and statement on his body in form of tattoos,” the court suggested a “treatment” to Kalmadi.

However, legal experts point out that Kalmadi might escape being tattooed as it could be deemed as an attack on individual freedom.

“Unless qualified doctors certify that what they showed in the movies i.e. tattooing was the only way to deal with this disorder, such a step would be similar to writing ‘mera baap chor hai’ on someone’s hand, as was shown in another movie,” Ramjhooth Malani, a lawyer expressing willingness to defend Kalmadi, argued.

Tihar jail authorities were not available to comment on the court order as it was a Sunday. Faking News then looked into the cell of Suresh Kalmadi to find out if the authorities were having tea there, but Kalmadi was found alone. When asked to comment, Kalmadi claimed that he didn’t remember anything related to any scam.

“What scam? Who are you guys? RSS agents? Don’t you know I’ve been given clean chit by Digvijay Singh?” Kalmadi told Faking News, which showed that he hadn’t forgotten everything yet.

Meanwhile sources inform that many other politicians lodged in Tihar jail have asked their doctors to find out if dementia was a contagious disease. If found so, they have expressed keen interest to get shifted to Kalmadi’s cell in order to get infected with the same disorder.

“Complaining of heart pain after being arrested on corruption charges is an old trick now, this one is simply awesome,” a politician lodged in Tihar jail said.

“All scams will become notional for us once we forget about them,” he added.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/kalmadi_tattoo-210x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/court-orders-to-tattoo-kalmadi-body-with-cwg-scam-facts-1820,Court orders Kalmadi’s body to be tattooed with CWG scam facts,,1311499043.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/katrina-kaif-to-do-an-item-number-during-rahul-gandhi-padyatra-1814,"Mumbai. Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif has offered to do a sexy and sizzling item number during Rahul Gandhi’s next visit to any city or village in Uttar Pradesh to compensate for her comments on Congress general secretary’s birth origins. Katrina had termed Rahul as half-Indian and half-Italian, which led to widespread damages such as a short term memory loss to Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari.

“I didn’t mean to hurt sentiments and I’ll do my best to soothe them,” the half-British half-Indian actress clarified, “I respect Rahul Gandhi as he is young and gifted like Salman Khan, and if he wants I can do an item number for his next padyatra as I’m doing for Sallu’s next movie.”

Katrina has left it on the Congress party to get back to her with location and dates for her pro-bono performance to mend ways with the ruling party.

It’s not yet clear if Rahul Gandhi will take part in the item number as part of his road shows

“She is a talented actress and I’ve seen all her movies. She was very good in Sheila Ki Jawaani,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said when contacted by Faking News for a comment. The comment by Mr. Tewari proved that the offer by Katrina had indeed healed the short term memory loss that was earlier inflicted on the Congress spokesman.

“High command will decide when and where to avail the services of Miss Kaif,” Manish Tewari added, “Miss Kaif a true patriot who cares for the poor masses and youth of the country.”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh, a regular appearance at Rahul Gandhi’s padyatra in Uttar Pradesh, too has welcomed Katrina Kaif’s offer and has given a clean chit to the actress for having no connection with RSS. Digvijay Singh has also offered to become the bodyguard of Katrina Kaif and slap anyone who comes near her while doing the item number.

Digvijay Singh slapped this reporter when he asked if he wanted to see Rahul Gandhi dancing with Katrina Kaif.

There has been no word from Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi regarding the item number, but experts believe that it might not be easy for the Congress high command to finalize the location and date for the performance.

“Farmers of Bhatta Parsaul village are already claiming first right of refusal over Katrina’s item number, Rahul can’t risk upsetting them,” an expert said, “There could also be law and order and crowd management problems. More people can turn up to watch Katrina Kaif as compared to curious people who come out to see Rahul Gandhi.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-to-read-news-on-doordarshan-to-connect-with-citizens-1812,"New Delhi. In order to silence his critics who accuse him of being a silent and impassive Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh has decided to become a newsreader on Doordarshan, the national broadcaster.

As part of the latest media strategy by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Prime Minister will read the daily 9 PM news bulletin on DD National and will end up connecting with the citizens on a daily basis.

“He will be the first PM who will address the nation daily,” Harish Khare, the media advisor to the PM said, “Not only he will update every citizen with the developments of the day, but will analyze those developments with experts for the benefit of the aam aadmi.”

Experts believe that this is a masterstroke by the Prime Minister as earlier he was accused of updating only Sonia Gandhi of all the developments in a day. However experts are not sure about the ‘analysis with the experts’ part of the PM’s media strategy.

Prime Minister rehearses his new role

“What if the high command asks him to have Digvijay Singh in the television studio as the expert to analyze terrorism?” Madhur Sharma, a media expert running his own blog showed the flipside of the PM’s media strategy.

“Digvijay Singh will hog all the limelight, will utter all that he wants, and PM will be left to do the explanation to the confused and angry viewers,” Madhur explained.

“Furthermore, will Manmohan Singh invite Rahul Gandhi to the studio for taking part in the debates and analysis?” Madhur further pointed out the ‘challenges’ of the PM’s media strategy, “What if Rahul rejects PM’s invitation as he has been doing to his recurrent invitations to join the cabinet? Will it lead to demands of Rahul Gandhi becoming the main newsreader on DD or will it lead to criticism that Rahul Gandhi avoids public debates?”

While experts analyze the pros and cons of PM becoming a DD newsreader, the leading news channels of India are reportedly scared of the consequences.

“It might lead to a loss of TRPs for leading news channels as people would love to watch a news bulletin where the anchor (Manmohan Singh) hardly speaks. Research proves that people are hell bored with television anchors who just won’t stop speaking and analyzing,” said the CEO of a news channel.

“The government might direct all the Bharat Nirman ads to Doordarshan if the PM’s news bulleting becomes a hit, this will cause revenue loss to us,” the CEO added.

However the common citizens have welcomed this proactive step by the Prime Minister.

“Yesterday I happened to watch DD News for a few minutes and I learned that there was a man called Hamid Ansari who is the Vice President of India. I never knew it!” Pradyumna, a 16-year-old Indian youth aspiring to win the MTV Roadies enumerated the benefits of watching Doordarshan.

“It would be lovely to see Manmohan Singh as a caring leader, wishing us all good evening and good night each day,” Kabir Saxena, a senior executive welcomed PM’s decision to become a newsreader, “Also, citizens won’t need to wait for the goodnight tweets of Rajdeep Sardesai before going to sleep peacefully.”

Impressed with what he has done after taking charge from A Raja, former telecommunications minister currently in Tihar jail, Congress is reportedly on a mission to develop biological clones of union minister Kapil Sibal, who would replace all ministers found guilty of corruption in future.

Sources say that the next cabinet reshuffle is being postponed till the first clone of Sibal arrives from a US laboratory and replaces Dayanidhi Maran, who recently resigned from the union cabinet on corruption charges.

“He is awesome,” a Congress source told Faking News referring to the abilities of Kapil Sibal, “He is a trained lawyer and no one can fuck around with him. You remember what he did to that Baba Ramdev? LOL!”

Kapil Sibal shows a document to journalists that they are too confused to read and analyze themselves, and instead are willing to report whatever Sibal says about it.

“You remember that notebook page that he produced as proof of ‘deal’ with Ramdev?” the source added after holding his laughter, “I am sure Sibal would have produced a similar notebook page to prove records of meeting with A Raja if he were in the place of P Chidambaram.”

Congress source further claimed that Sibal had the abilities to come up with Digvijay Singh type statements and actions, but with a flair and finesse that people like Diggy can never even dream to match.

“See, I’d explain you. He comes up with statements like – PM can be probed by Lokpal after he quits – and the statement sounds so thoughtful to media. The funny thing is – if PM quits, he is no longer a PM! So basically Sibal was saying – Lokpal can NOT probe PM!” the source explained.

Sources attribute this particular talent of Sibal to his professional training as a lawyer, but maintain that there was something special about Sibal.

“Even Manish Tewary, our spokesman in slow-motion, is a lawyer, and he comes up with profound legal bullshit every now and then, but somehow he is never as convincing as Sibal. It’s not about being a lawyer; even BJP has lawyers in their ranks. We are just fortunate to have Sibal,” the source said.

Congress is reported to have commissioned a US genetic research laboratory to come up with at least a dozen biological clones of Kapil Sibal so that almost every plush ministry is handled by the astute lawyer-politician from Delhi, who successfully answers and nips any query about any seemingly corrupt practice in bud.

When Faking News asked who paid the bill for the cloning of Sibal, we were asked to file an RTI with the Home Ministry, submit an application attested by a gazetted officer in triplets with the US Embassy, and undertake an affidavit to publish the truth on the website.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-to-appear-in-the-next-season-of-maa-exchange-1792,"Lucknow. After impressing the rural aam aadmi with his padyatra in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi has decided to appear in the next season of the Reality TV show “Maa Exchange” to impress upon the urban aam aadmi. Rahul had travelled in economy classes of trains and watched cricket matches from general stands to achieve the same result earlier, but his latest decision is aimed at connecting with the urban aam aadmi in the closest possible way.

“According to a study conducted by Sensing Human Interest in Television (S.H.I.T) institute, the common man of India spends more time following reality TV shows than travelling in a train or watching cricket matches; we see more voting in one season of Indian Idol than the parliamentary elections,” Rahul Gandhi explained the rationale behind his decision.

Pooja Bedi, often confused by many television savvy youth as one of the members of the Lokpal Bill drafting committee, had earlier appeared in the reality show Maa Exchange.

The Congress youth icon further claimed that he had put a lot of thought behind which television show to select and only after evaluating them all he selected Maa Exchange – a reality show where contestants swap their families for a short duration and live in each other’s homes.

When asked to elaborate, Digvijay Singh intervened to explain the though process, “We ruled out singing shows as no one in Gandhi family sings to others’ tunes. We decided against dance shows after watching Sushma Swaraj practicing her dance moves; Rahul baba had no such practice and it would have been unfair to him to put him up against people who have been practicing so far in advance. Bigg Boss was ruled out because last time a Rahul (Mahajan) from a political family went there, they made him clean toilets.”

“We would have settled for MTV Roadies as it’s popular with today’s youth and the fellow contestants surely appear to have lower IQ than Rahul Baba, but there was risk of ABVP goons attacking the show. Finally we settled for Maa Exchange – it is the perfect show where both Madamji and Rahulji can participate and showcase their leadership qualities,” Digvijay Singh explained, drawing nods from Rahul Gandhi.

However Digvijay Singh clarified that Rahul Gandhi will not take part in the show if the producers decided to swap Varun Gandhi’s maa for the show. Sources suggest that a general consensus is emerging around Aishwarya Rai’s yet to be born child as the challenger to Rahul in the reality show.

“We are not in any hurry. Anyway, Rahul Gandhi will not be able to take part in another reality show till Uttar Pradesh elections are over,” Digvijay Singh said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Pooja-Bedi-in-Maa-Exchange-180x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-to-appear-in-the-next-season-of-maa-exchange-1792,Rahul Gandhi to appear in the next season of “Maa Exchange”,,1310060009.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

“Ho ho ho, ha ha ha, oh man!” Prime Minister loudly uttered these words for the first time in office, bringing the PMO to a standstill. At least three special secretaries of IAS rank and ten housekeeping staff are reported to have rushed into the office of PM to check if everything was alright.

“Hahaha… Have you guys seen this? This is so funny!” Dr. Singh is reported to have told the just-in officers pointing towards the television that had started showing Bhaarat Nirmaan ad by then.

“No, no, not this one, those Ranbir Kapoor ads,” Prime Minister clarified in a hurry to a dumbfounded PMO staff.

The man who made the PM break his silence?

After fifteen minutes of unprecedented consistent talking, which included showering praise for the copywriter of the ad and National Awards worthy performance by the Bollywood heartthrob, Prime Minister is reported to have asked all the assembled members of the PMO staff to watch all the DoCoMo stand-up ads by Ranbir Kapoor and ‘like’ all the pages related the actor on Facebook.

“I am still shocked,” an officer in the PMO said on conditions of anonymity, “Prime Minister had never shown such outspokenness and liveliness ever before. He never even asked us to ‘like’ Congress or Rahul Gandhi pages on Facebook. And laughing out loud!? My god, is this real? Pinch me and tell me I’m not dreaming!”

It’s not yet known what caused this dramatic transformation in Prime Minister, who recently announced that he would be talking to journalists each week to dispel the myth that he was a passive or puppet Prime Minister.

“I think PM has taken this responsibility of changing his public image a tad too seriously,” a television expert on everything told Faking News, “He talked at length on some issues with editors yesterday and it seems he is going to talk on any issue with anyone from now on.”

Further investigations by Faking News into the mysterious event at PMO revealed that Prime Minister had seen the “No auto activation: Maa” stand-up ad where Ranbir Kapoor says “aye le aaloo ka paraantha, aye le caller tune” in a Punjabi accent comparing a mother with a mobile service provider, who impose their own choices on a person without even asking or waiting for his or her approval.

Unconfirmed reports say that one of the PMO staff, goaded by PM’s lively mood, tried to improvise the joke and compared the mother in the ad with Sonia Gandhi. He is reported to have said, “aye le Finance Minister, aye le Home Minister” apparently referring to the impending cabinet reshuffle and other decisions by the PMO.

The officer has been suspended for six weeks, sources say.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tata_docomo-250x190.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-laughs-out-loud-at-ranbir-kapoor-docomo-joke-1780,Manmohan Singh laughs out loud at Ranbir Kapoor’s DoCoMo joke,,1309408858.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-asks-congress-leaders-to-shut-the-eff-up-1758,"New Delhi. Mighty pissed off with random statements from random Congress leaders criticizing the government led by him, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked those leaders to either keep their mouth shut or come up with some other nonsense that doesn’t target him or his government.

Sources at PMO inform that Dr. Singh is mighty irritated with his party taking credit for all the good work done by him, while not sharing the blame for the unpopular decisions taken by the UPA government led by Congress.

“Prime Minister had thrown a paperweight against his office wall in anger when he read news reports where Congress had distanced itself from the Congress led government’s decision of sending four ministers, all of them members of the Congress party, to receive Baba Ramdev at airport,” a PMO source informed.

Manmohan Singh thinking about his party

“He was annoyed that while media calls him a puppet prime minister, such asinine decisions were directly attributed to him as if he took all the decisions by the government independently,” the source said.

Already irritated, Dr. Singh is reported to have gone in a total bad mood when he read news reports about Digvijay Singh wanting Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister.

“What kind of crap is being thrown at me daily? And why on earth me? What the hell have I done?” normally silent and calm Manmohan Singh is reported to have written in a letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi, the President of Congress, after he couldn’t take it anymore.

“I mean, how the hell is Congress not responsible for anything that my government does? For god’s sake, the whole union cabinet is almost made up of only Congress members!” the former RBI governor is said to have argued, without referring to any decisions being taken by Sonia Gandhi.

“The DMK ministers are in jail or on the way, the Trinamool ministers are still having party in Kolkata, the NCP ministers are busy managing their own businesses; that leaves only Congress ministers actively taking part in cabinet meetings, and yet Congress is not responsible for government actions?” Manmohan Singh explained his arguments.

“Don’t give me that shit again,” he said.

Sources further say that Dr. Singh has recently ordered many books on life and times of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/manmohan_singh-250x186.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-asks-congress-leaders-to-shut-the-eff-up-1758,Manmohan Singh asks Congress leaders to shut the fuck up,,1308580334.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Mainpuri. On his birthday that also happens to be Father’s Day, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi has declared that he’d adopt a dalit girl child and become her foster father. Rahul has adopted the same eight-year-old girl, with whom he had ridden a buffalo around three years ago while on his expeditions to Uttar Pradesh to discover the other India. The girl’s name is Maya Kumari.

“Our office received a fax from Switzerland, where Rahulji and Soniaji are currently holidaying, apprising us of Rahul Baba’s decision. Little Maya’s father had passed away in her childhood and her mother had tough time raising her; she even resorted to selling her to a rich man in Ambedkarnagar. Mayawati government didn’t help her at all so our party decided to step in,” local Congress leader Sapna Merchant informed.

According to Sapna, Little Maya will now fly to New Delhi with Congress general secretary and live with Rahul Gandhi at his official residence. She will also get to study in the best of the schools and colleges in India and abroad. Rahul has promised to her that her dream of becoming a nuclear scientist will get realized one day, and he’d be a proud father then.

Rahul Gandhi’s love for children, a newsworthy piece of information that could be linked to Chacha Nehru, could now come into limelight in the mainstream media following the latest decision by Rahul.

While Congress claims that the whole village is happy with this good news, reports suggest that a few villagers were unhappy with what they called “preferential treatment” given to one child. It should be noted (refer to this report) that Rahul Gandhi had gone on a buffalo ride with two kids, the other being equally unfortunate to be living in poverty.

“Why was the other kid, the boy Naram Yadav, left to fend for his own? Rahul made use of him when he wanted to ride a buffalo and now he doesn’t even care to visit his house. Why this special treatment to Maya? This is politics of the worst kind,” Shishupal, an angry villager claimed.

Not only villagers like Shishupal, Rahul’s apparently benevolent act has riled even Mayawati, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Maya has accused Rahul of being a ‘naatakbaaz’ like Mahatma Gandhi, who had no genuine intentions to help dalits. She further claimed that the whole act was a conspiracy to defraud dalits of their rights and identity.

“This dramabaaz Gandhi has deliberately chosen my namesake to insult me and hence the whole dalit community. He wants to finish dalits! Now that dalit girl will no longer remain a dalit because caste of a person is the same as his or her father’s caste. In essence, Rahul Gandhi has only reduced the population and weakened the strength of dalits,” Mayawati alleged.

Mayawati also announced a “chheen lo” (snatch them) movement on this occasion asking all dalit families to take back their sons and daughters who might have been adopted or being raised by Congress workers in recent years.

But the government at center has rejected and ridiculed Mayawati’s allegations and lauded Rahul Gandhi for adopting a girl child. The union minister for Women and Child Development has announced a full page color advertisement in all the leading national dailies to appreciate Rahul’s noble act and message.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Rahul_Gandhi_with_a_kid-237x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Rahul Gandhi adopts dalit child on Father’s Day, Mayawati furious",,1308470188.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-worker-tattoos-body-with-rahul-gandhi-pics-to-support-farmers-rights-1754,"Lucknow. A young Congress worker has got his whole body tattooed with Rahul Gandhi’s name and images, presumably to create awareness on farmers’ rights in the state. 28-year-old Gunjan Joshi claims that his daring act will instill confidence in the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, who are under murderous attack from the tyrannous regime of Mayawati.

Gunjan, now being called “Godna Gandhi” or GG for having tattoos all over his body, will undertake a padyatra (on foot journey) in support of farmers’ rights on 19th June – the birthday of Rahul Gandhi, which will be celebrated as “Kisan Adhikar Divas” or Farmers’ Rights Day by the state unit of Congress party.

“Rahul Baba has sacrificed a lot for the farmers of this country, especially those in Uttar Pradesh,” Gunjan said, attracting huge applause from the fellow Congress workers, “This is the minimum that the citizens of India should do to express their gratitude. I hope the youth of this country would join me.”

A farmer from Uttar Pradesh, whose fortunes chould soon change due to the mass awareness campaign launched by the Congress worker.

Gunjan strongly refuted allegations that his act smacked of sycophancy and a desperate act to please Rahul Gandhi, who many consider as Prime Minister-in-waiting.

“Getting tattoos on body is no sycophancy,” GG argued, “People around the world use it to portray priorities in their lives. I have done the same.”

“My priority is to get farmers of Uttar Pradesh justice,” he clarified.

When asked how name and images of Rahul Gandhi on his body could deliver justice to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Gunjan dismissed such concerns as “cynical” and a “conspiracy” by communal forces to weaken his strong resolve.

State unit of Congress, which has been busy getting posters of Rahul Gandhi printed and pasted in time to celebrate the Farmers’ Rights Day, confirmed that whatever Gunjan had done was a decision taken in a personal capacity and the hitherto unknown Congress worker was not advised by any senior leader to do so.

“Although we had no idea that he had such plans, our party will back any genuine attempt by committed individuals to fight for the rights of the farmers,” state Congress head Rita Bahuguna Joshi praised the “selfless dedication” of Gunjan Joshi towards the cause of poor farmers.

Gunjan or GG will start his padyatra from the local Ambedkar Park on Sunday 10.00 AM. He has already been in talks with local news reporters of various national television channels to “get it right”. At the end of his journey, which he calls a “youth movement”, GG hopes to win higher compensation for farmers in Bhatta Parsaul and a chance to meet Rahul Gandhi.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gov-cool-with-corrupt-and-criminal-babas-till-they-dont-get-into-politics-1746,"New Delhi. Government of India has clarified that that it didn’t give a hoot for various crooks and criminals masquerading as godmen and gurus till they kept off politics. The clarification has been welcomed by all political parties and leaders of the nation hope that such babas would continue doing what they are good at – sleight of hand, spreading superstition, sheltering criminals, money laundering, and sex scandals – and not interfere in their domain.

“Did we arrest anyone for preaching that having a black dog in the north-west corner of the house will get rid of financial troubles? Or did we ever call anyone claiming himself as god as some sort of thug?” argued Congress speaker Janardan Dwivedi, rejecting the criticism that Congress was anti-baba because of its recent and relentless campaign against Baba Ramdev.

Government says that babas can appear on national television, keep on practicing and preaching bullshit with impunity, but shouldn’t enter politics.

“In fact, many of us follow such babas and consult them before filing nominations for elections,” Dwivedi clarified, “We love what babas do, but we have problems when they try to get into our space. That’s not what babas are supposed to do.”

Dwivedi further pointed out that a highly controversial godman like Chandraswami had been the spiritual guru of many Congress leaders till he was suspected of being involved in Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination.

“Don’t target the family and don’t get into politics is all we are asking these guys,” Dwivedi added.

BJP too has welcomed the clarification and hoped that various babas will “get the message” continue doing the “good work” instead of trying to act like a proactive opposition party.

However, experts believe that babas of the country might not settle for this compromise formula and the country could see more clashes between babas and netas (politicians) in future.

“See, first it happened with politicians and criminals, once the criminals realized that why should they stick to booth capturing and intimidating voters on behalf of some politician when they could do those for themselves,” social scientist Parikshit said, “Babas too seem to have realized that they were equally good at fooling people and yet appearing as caring for them – hallmark of a politician – so they would surely fancy their chances in politics.”

“The stiff competition from criminals pushed the leaders to make some laws that barred criminals from contesting elections, but no such laws exist for babas,” Parikshit pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/India_TV-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gov-cool-with-corrupt-and-criminal-babas-till-they-dont-get-into-politics-1746,Government cool with corrupt and criminal babas till they don’t get into politics,,1307949319.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-threatens-to-raise-an-army-of-11000-bullshitters-1740,"New Delhi. After Baba Ramdev threatened to raise an army of 11000 young men well trained in martial arts, Congress leader Digvijay Singh has threatened to counter him by raising his own army of 11000 young men well trained in vocal farts. These men, personally picked and trained by the Congress general secretary, will not only oppose Ramdev’s army, but will aim to frustrate and annihilate any person having a different point of view.

“Each one of my bullshitter will have the capacity to mindfuck thousands of Ramdev’s half-naked yogis or Anna’s candle carrying protestors,” Digvijay Singh claimed in a press conference, announcing his grand plans to raise an army of bullshitting men, tentatively named “D-Men”, on the lines of X-Men.

“Yes, we can!” said Digvijay Singh, assuring his followers that bullshitting was not so difficult if one tried.

Unlike X-Men, the D-Men won’t be any mutants having biological superpowers. They would be ordinary human beings with extra-ordinary bullshitting skills, unmatched by even the most professional and jobless trolls on the interwebs.

“Just imagine 11000 Digvijay Singhs,” the Congress general secretary explained his grand plans and threatened of the consequences.

Mr. Singh clarified that his plans, although announced to counter Ramdev’s army, were not hinged on Baba Ramdev’s plans, and that he was most certainly going to raise this army even if Baba backed off from his own plans.

The former Madhya Pradesh CM further clarified that he was raising this army not to assault anyone but to attack someone.

“What bullshit!” responded a journalist after hearing the above statement. The journalist, instantly recognized as an RSS agent, was later bashed up and kicked by Digvijay Singh and other journalists present at the press conference.

Post the assault on the journalist, the press conference resumed and Digvijay Singh announced that a public audition to shortlist promising young bullshitters from India would be held soon, and a selected few would be trained to attain perfection in this art.

The announcement by Diggy Raja has expectedly snowballed into a political controversy with BJP threatening to raise its own army of bullshitters under the able leadership of Navjot Singh Siddhu.

In a shocking claim about the head of the Council of Ministers, the two-in-one cabinet minister of telecommunications and HRD, Kapil Sibal has claimed that the post of Prime Minister in India was “notional” and in reality Prime Minister did not exist.

However, Mr. Sibal clarified that it didn’t mean that there was no government in India or there was no individual called Dr. Manmohan Singh.

“Of course there is a government and there is an order of law in this country,” Sibal said in a press conference which was boycotted by all shoe-throwers of the country. “But if you ask about Prime Minister, well, it’s a notional post. We realized that duties of a Prime Minister could be discharged even without having one.”

Kapil Sibal looks at a journalist who appeared unconvinced about his assertions

Sibal further disclosed that National Advisory Council (NAC), the group of advisors that gives some direction to the Council of Ministers in absence of a real Prime Minister, had even proposed to do away with the post of Prime Minister as part of the “austerity drive” and save the government myriad expenses like PM’s salary and PMO’s electricity bills.

“It was an excellent and practical suggestion! But it would have needed some fundamental changes in constitution before implementation. BJP, the notional opposition party, might not have agreed for this constitutional change so we decided to continue with one,” Sibal informed, reiterating that the country and the cabinet could function even without a Prime Minister.

When asked by Faking News about Dr. Manmohan Singh, who is widely regarded as the Prime Minister of India, Sibal confirmed that Dr. Singh existed and was part of the government.

“Dr. Singh is the Chairman of the Planning Commission, an extra-constitution and non-statutory body like NAC,” Sibal informed, “That’s a real post, and is often referred to the Prime Minister of India by the constitution and media.”

Sibal, however, refused to draw parallels between Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of NAC and Manmohan Singh, the Chairperson of Planning Commission, arguing that the duties and responsibilities of both were “fundamentally different”.

“He makes Five-year plans,” Sibal clarified about the duties of Dr. Manmohan Singh.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/KapilSibal-250x218.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/prime-minister-is-notional-does-not-exist-claims-kapil-sibal-1734,"Prime Minister is notional, does not exist, claims Kapil Sibal",,1307442094.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Impressed with his impeccable record of helping his current organization i.e. Congress in dealing with criticism and public attack, mobile services company Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh to become the head of its Customer Care operations.

Vodafone took this step after it drew flak for its decision to sue a customer, who posted negative things about the company on Facebook.

“I think if Digvijay Singh were with us, he would have openly declared that customer a thug and an Airtel agent trying to defame our company,” Vodafone India CEO Kapil Birbal said, explaining why the telecom services company made a job offer to Digvijay Singh.

Digvijay Singh reacts when asked if any private company can afford him

Vodafone CEO also clarified that Digvijay Singh’s persona was in keeping with the two popular customer care icons of the company – Cheeka, the pug, and Zoozoo, the egg-headed rounded creature.

“He follows Rahul Gandhi wherever he goes, like Cheeka used to do, and he speaks in a language that can be interpreted in many ways, something we thought was very much like Zoozoos,” Vodafone CEO explained the cultural fit Digvijay Singh had with the company.

“He is always ‘Happy to Help’ people who employ him,” the CEO said, referring to the customer care tagline of his company.

“Furthermore, we all know he loves talking on telephones and mobiles,” he added.

It’s not yet clear what kind of compensation Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh for rendering his professional services, but the company’s HR department made it clear that Diggy Raja didn’t need to give up his job of a politician to join the company.

“It’s not necessary to give up politics to do something else,” Vodafone’s HR head clarified to Faking News when pointed out that Digvijay Singh had asked Baba Ramdev to give up yoga if he wanted to enter politics.

The mobile company is confident that with Digvijay Singh on their side, they will not only be able to reject all criticism from the public, but also get some free publicity, for which they had to pay through their nose during the IPL.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-to-do-a-prison-break-to-rescue-kanimozhi-from-tihar-jail-1701,"New Delhi. If sources are to be believed then India is all set to witness its own real life version of the Prison Break. This time it will be the DMK head Karunanidhi who will do a Scofield to help his daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi escape from the Tihar Jail.

It should be noted that Prison Break was a famous American TV serial drama in which Scofield rescues his brother out of a prison by staging a bank robbery and getting himself to be arrested and sent to the same prison where his brother has been held until execution on false charges.

Fearing that the option of staging a bank robbery might turn out to be a process in futility as the country’s treasury has already been robbed off with the 2G scam, Karunanidhi is planning to stage a robbery of Rahul Gandhi’s most cherished possession of Italian actress Monica Bellucci’s original pic signed by her.

Inside the jail, Kani has already been informed of the plan.

“Due to lack of court date on Sunday, Kani was relaxing in her cell flipping between Sun and Kalaignar TV while dunking Parle-G biscuits in tea, when she got a visitor. Immediately after she was allegedly told about the plan, I saw her secretly summoning her neighboring cell-mates Madhuri Gupta and Sonu Punjaban,” said the jail warden who was later suspended for allegedly humming the Raja Ko Rani Se Pyaar Ho Gaya tune.

Karunanidhi is reported to have smiled over the idea after being glum for many days over the election defeat and arrest of his daughter.

The suspended warden claims that Kani has finalized the role assignment for the escape job on the big day. Madhuri Gupta will grab the role of spying on the prison faculties and Sonu Punjaban will get the job of accepting money from Kani and arranging for the necessary resources.

At one stage Kani had even included Kalmadi, currently residing in Jail number 4 to provide the logistics for the escape but later he was eased out from the plan. It is believed that the pole-vault that Kalmadi procured for prison break, at five times the market price, turned out to be of a very low quality and broke as soon as they tried to jump off in the trial escape.

A senior DMK leader, on condition of anonymity told Faking News, “Kalaignar is confident of pulling this off as much as he is confident of winning the next assembly elections. Besides, compared to the Scofield, Kalaignar has a larger surface area to offer for the tattoo. In fact we are even planning to use the extra area to add the route map of the Tihar Jail canteen where Kalaignar can have his favorite sambar rice and curd in the mid of escape if the glucose levels go down.”

Since the rescue-plan has already been leaked, Delhi police is under tremendous pressure to prevent the successful execution of the plan. Savdhaan Singh, senior inspector at the Tihar jail said, “All the security guards have been given a month leave to watch closely all the episodes of How I Met Your Mother.”

Later, it was found out that a little “oversight” on the part of jail intelligence agencies had caused this goof-up between the television series.

And just in case jail authorities succeed in watching the right series, there is a back-up plan.

“In event of failure, Appa has planned to come out with the truth and name all the big guns involved in the scam. The government could then be forced to ask Supreme Court, which is currently driving the CBI to probe the 2G scam, to stop interfering in the powers of the executive and let the law take its own course,” the DMK source revealed.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/inspired-by-behenji-and-didi-mulayam-decides-to-call-himself-bhaiyyaji-1693,"Lucknow. Indian politics at the moment looks like a flick straight out of the Rajshri production house with Didi (Mamata Banerjee), Amma (Jayalalithaa), Behenji (Mayawati) and Aunty (Shiela Dixit) in lead roles. While India celebrates the success of these four powerful women ruling some of India’s most populous states, Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is also known as Netaji, has decided to go for a complete makeover.

“With the blessings of Madam (Sonia Gandhi), I have decided to form an alliance with Behenji and become a Bhaiyyaji,” said a rejuvenated Mulayam who has been, for quite some time now, on the wrong side of Mayawati and CM’s post.

Sliding into an introspective mood, Mulayam ponders, “Look, it’s quite clear looking at those four lady CMs that people like leaders who have nicknames that remind them of their blood relatives. And I have been wondering if distributing money during elections or magic of muscle power was on the wane. Thank god I realized this before changing my original ways.”

Mulayam could re-launch himself with such old pictures in an attempt to rebrand himself

“Sure. Why not? I think my Pappa can become a very good Bhaiyyaji. We’d have realized it much earlier but that Amar Singh confused us by bringing in Munnabhai, who clearly was more of a bhai than bhaiyya,” said Mulayam’s son Akhilesh Yadav, whom friends fondly call Microsoft (Chhota Mulayam).

However, Mulayam’s decision has drawn a strong reaction from the MNS chief Raj Thackeray, who wrote in his column “United India”: Aamcha paksh konatyahi bhaiyachya navala Ji lavnar naay, aani yachi mee guarantee deto (My party will ensure that no Bhaiyya ever gets the honorific Ji behind his/her name. I guarantee that!)

Mulayam’s decision has also left the likes of Lalu Prasad Yadav in a fix, not able to decide upon a suitable family-name, which would get them an entry into the New World Order.

Always at a statement away from controversy, our very own Diggy Raja said, “Trusting people with names indicating blood relations prove that people believe in family power. That and only that is the reason why Congress always sticks to the Gandhi family.”

Last heard, Digvijay Singh was summoned by the Congress high command for the third time in a space of 24 hours.

In a humble gesture after her landslide victory, AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa has decided to gift free mixer-grinders to the wives of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi as part of the implementation of her party’s manifesto. Amma had promised to provide free mixer-grinder to women and free bus passes to senior citizens to travel within and nearby towns.

A free bus pass could be given to Karunanidhi too while a ceiling fan is in pipeline for A Raja in Tihar jail, but a formal announcement is pending on these two.

DMK believes that Jayalalithaa’s friendly gesture could be a deadly trap

“Amma wants to start her new term on a humble and pleasant note, unlike last time when she got Karunanidhi arrested in the midnight,” an AIADMK spokesman confirmed, “She has no ill-will towards the DMK family and is willing to treat them as equal citizens of Tamil Nadu. In fact, through this step, she has felicitated the family.”

Party sources claim that Jayalalithaa was sending out a message that she’d be completely non-partisan while implementing her election manifesto promises. Sources further claimed that the step also went on to prove that the promised goodies in the manifesto were not any type of “bribe”, as has been criticized by many commentators.

“That would have been a bribe if we had given them only to those who had voted for Amma, clearly the wives of Karunanidhi didn’t vote for AIADMK, unless you can prove the contrary,” the party spokesman argued, “See, we are not giving any mixer-grinder, ceiling fan, or laptop to Rajinikanth, who was reported as having voted for Amma. It’s not any bribe.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,"New Delhi. Congress leader and former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh has made India proud by becoming the first human being on earth to get an ISO certification for his integrity.

Diggy Raja, as he is fondly called, now has an ISO 9001:2008 certificate for his integrity, which means now he can officially question anyone’s integrity without worrying about defamation suits, unless of course the other person too has ISO certified integrity.

“We took the decision after observing him in the last two-three years,” informed Mr. Sharad Pawar, Union Minister for Agriculture, who is also the head of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), a member body of the International Organization for Standardization that determines the standards for ISO certification.

Digvijay Singh is seen happy here after receiving the certificate on his integrity

Sharad Pawar further informed that Digvijay Singh had been “under observation” for the last couple of years after he started questioning the authenticity, credibility and integrity of events, institutions and individuals.

Soon after, BIS officials realized that there has been a “standard pattern” in what Digvijay Singh said or questioned, and his actions were very “system driven” that always satisfied a set of “patrons”; something that qualified him for getting a certificate under the ISO 9000 family of standards.

“He was awarded ISO 9001:2008 as 2008 was the years after which his standards were set,” said Sharad Pawar, who also clarified that an approval by BIS meant that Digvijay was also eligible for an “ISI mark” on his integrity.

Following the certification, Digvijay Singh has arguably become the most upright person in India right now, something that might make him eligible for the post of “Jan Lokpal”, but Diggy Raja denied that he had any such ambitions.

“I don’t want any posts, I’m happy with this certificate that proves that I faithfully adhere to the standards of family,” Digvijay Singh said in a press conference accepting the certificate from Mr. Pawar.

“I meant family of standards,” he later clarified.

Digvijay Singh also said that he’d soon release an ISO certified CD of the conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh, which will put the controversy to rest.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/digvijay-250x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,Digvijay Singh becomes first man to have ISO certified integrity,,1303460593.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-laughs-out-loud-at-ranbir-kapoor-docomo-joke-1780,"New Delhi. In a rare occasion involving public display of emotions and non-silence, Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh abandoned his usual impassive and quiet demeanor and went LOL (laughing out loud) at one of the jokes cracked by Ranbir Kapoor during DoCoMo television ads. The unbridled laughter, which lasted for 30 seconds i.e. as long as the ad, was recorded early today when PM was watching television to pass time before cabinet reshuffle.

“Ho ho ho, ha ha ha, oh man!” Prime Minister loudly uttered these words for the first time in office, bringing the PMO to a standstill. At least three special secretaries of IAS rank and ten housekeeping staff are reported to have rushed into the office of PM to check if everything was alright.

“Hahaha… Have you guys seen this? This is so funny!” Dr. Singh is reported to have told the just-in officers pointing towards the television that had started showing Bhaarat Nirmaan ad by then.

“No, no, not this one, those Ranbir Kapoor ads,” Prime Minister clarified in a hurry to a dumbfounded PMO staff.

The man who made the PM break his silence?

After fifteen minutes of unprecedented consistent talking, which included showering praise for the copywriter of the ad and National Awards worthy performance by the Bollywood heartthrob, Prime Minister is reported to have asked all the assembled members of the PMO staff to watch all the DoCoMo stand-up ads by Ranbir Kapoor and ‘like’ all the pages related the actor on Facebook.

“I am still shocked,” an officer in the PMO said on conditions of anonymity, “Prime Minister had never shown such outspokenness and liveliness ever before. He never even asked us to ‘like’ Congress or Rahul Gandhi pages on Facebook. And laughing out loud!? My god, is this real? Pinch me and tell me I’m not dreaming!”

It’s not yet known what caused this dramatic transformation in Prime Minister, who recently announced that he would be talking to journalists each week to dispel the myth that he was a passive or puppet Prime Minister.

“I think PM has taken this responsibility of changing his public image a tad too seriously,” a television expert on everything told Faking News, “He talked at length on some issues with editors yesterday and it seems he is going to talk on any issue with anyone from now on.”

Further investigations by Faking News into the mysterious event at PMO revealed that Prime Minister had seen the “No auto activation: Maa” stand-up ad where Ranbir Kapoor says “aye le aaloo ka paraantha, aye le caller tune” in a Punjabi accent comparing a mother with a mobile service provider, who impose their own choices on a person without even asking or waiting for his or her approval.

Unconfirmed reports say that one of the PMO staff, goaded by PM’s lively mood, tried to improvise the joke and compared the mother in the ad with Sonia Gandhi. He is reported to have said, “aye le Finance Minister, aye le Home Minister” apparently referring to the impending cabinet reshuffle and other decisions by the PMO.

Mighty pissed off with random statements from random Congress leaders criticizing the government led by him, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked those leaders to either keep their mouth shut or come up with some other nonsense that doesn’t target him or his government.

Sources at PMO inform that Dr. Singh is mighty irritated with his party taking credit for all the good work done by him, while not sharing the blame for the unpopular decisions taken by the UPA government led by Congress.

“Prime Minister had thrown a paperweight against his office wall in anger when he read news reports where Congress had distanced itself from the Congress led government’s decision of sending four ministers, all of them members of the Congress party, to receive Baba Ramdev at airport,” a PMO source informed.

Manmohan Singh thinking about his party

“He was annoyed that while media calls him a puppet prime minister, such asinine decisions were directly attributed to him as if he took all the decisions by the government independently,” the source said.

Already irritated, Dr. Singh is reported to have gone in a total bad mood when he read news reports about Digvijay Singh wanting Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister.

“What kind of crap is being thrown at me daily? And why on earth me? What the hell have I done?” normally silent and calm Manmohan Singh is reported to have written in a letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi, the President of Congress, after he couldn’t take it anymore.

“I mean, how the hell is Congress not responsible for anything that my government does? For god’s sake, the whole union cabinet is almost made up of only Congress members!” the former RBI governor is said to have argued, without referring to any decisions being taken by Sonia Gandhi.

“The DMK ministers are in jail or on the way, the Trinamool ministers are still having party in Kolkata, the NCP ministers are busy managing their own businesses; that leaves only Congress ministers actively taking part in cabinet meetings, and yet Congress is not responsible for government actions?” Manmohan Singh explained his arguments.

“Don’t give me that shit again,” he said.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Mainpuri. On his birthday that also happens to be Father’s Day, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi has declared that he’d adopt a dalit girl child and become her foster father. Rahul has adopted the same eight-year-old girl, with whom he had ridden a buffalo around three years ago while on his expeditions to Uttar Pradesh to discover the other India. The girl’s name is Maya Kumari.

“Our office received a fax from Switzerland, where Rahulji and Soniaji are currently holidaying, apprising us of Rahul Baba’s decision. Little Maya’s father had passed away in her childhood and her mother had tough time raising her; she even resorted to selling her to a rich man in Ambedkarnagar. Mayawati government didn’t help her at all so our party decided to step in,” local Congress leader Sapna Merchant informed.

According to Sapna, Little Maya will now fly to New Delhi with Congress general secretary and live with Rahul Gandhi at his official residence. She will also get to study in the best of the schools and colleges in India and abroad. Rahul has promised to her that her dream of becoming a nuclear scientist will get realized one day, and he’d be a proud father then.

Rahul Gandhi’s love for children, a newsworthy piece of information that could be linked to Chacha Nehru, could now come into limelight in the mainstream media following the latest decision by Rahul.

While Congress claims that the whole village is happy with this good news, reports suggest that a few villagers were unhappy with what they called “preferential treatment” given to one child. It should be noted (refer to this report) that Rahul Gandhi had gone on a buffalo ride with two kids, the other being equally unfortunate to be living in poverty.

“Why was the other kid, the boy Naram Yadav, left to fend for his own? Rahul made use of him when he wanted to ride a buffalo and now he doesn’t even care to visit his house. Why this special treatment to Maya? This is politics of the worst kind,” Shishupal, an angry villager claimed.

Not only villagers like Shishupal, Rahul’s apparently benevolent act has riled even Mayawati, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Maya has accused Rahul of being a ‘naatakbaaz’ like Mahatma Gandhi, who had no genuine intentions to help dalits. She further claimed that the whole act was a conspiracy to defraud dalits of their rights and identity.

“This dramabaaz Gandhi has deliberately chosen my namesake to insult me and hence the whole dalit community. He wants to finish dalits! Now that dalit girl will no longer remain a dalit because caste of a person is the same as his or her father’s caste. In essence, Rahul Gandhi has only reduced the population and weakened the strength of dalits,” Mayawati alleged.

Mayawati also announced a “chheen lo” (snatch them) movement on this occasion asking all dalit families to take back their sons and daughters who might have been adopted or being raised by Congress workers in recent years.

But the government at center has rejected and ridiculed Mayawati’s allegations and lauded Rahul Gandhi for adopting a girl child. The union minister for Women and Child Development has announced a full page color advertisement in all the leading national dailies to appreciate Rahul’s noble act and message.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Rahul_Gandhi_with_a_kid-237x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Rahul Gandhi adopts dalit child on Father’s Day, Mayawati furious",,1308470188.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-worker-tattoos-body-with-rahul-gandhi-pics-to-support-farmers-rights-1754,"Lucknow. A young Congress worker has got his whole body tattooed with Rahul Gandhi’s name and images, presumably to create awareness on farmers’ rights in the state. 28-year-old Gunjan Joshi claims that his daring act will instill confidence in the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, who are under murderous attack from the tyrannous regime of Mayawati.

Gunjan, now being called “Godna Gandhi” or GG for having tattoos all over his body, will undertake a padyatra (on foot journey) in support of farmers’ rights on 19th June – the birthday of Rahul Gandhi, which will be celebrated as “Kisan Adhikar Divas” or Farmers’ Rights Day by the state unit of Congress party.

“Rahul Baba has sacrificed a lot for the farmers of this country, especially those in Uttar Pradesh,” Gunjan said, attracting huge applause from the fellow Congress workers, “This is the minimum that the citizens of India should do to express their gratitude. I hope the youth of this country would join me.”

A farmer from Uttar Pradesh, whose fortunes chould soon change due to the mass awareness campaign launched by the Congress worker.

Gunjan strongly refuted allegations that his act smacked of sycophancy and a desperate act to please Rahul Gandhi, who many consider as Prime Minister-in-waiting.

“Getting tattoos on body is no sycophancy,” GG argued, “People around the world use it to portray priorities in their lives. I have done the same.”

“My priority is to get farmers of Uttar Pradesh justice,” he clarified.

When asked how name and images of Rahul Gandhi on his body could deliver justice to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Gunjan dismissed such concerns as “cynical” and a “conspiracy” by communal forces to weaken his strong resolve.

State unit of Congress, which has been busy getting posters of Rahul Gandhi printed and pasted in time to celebrate the Farmers’ Rights Day, confirmed that whatever Gunjan had done was a decision taken in a personal capacity and the hitherto unknown Congress worker was not advised by any senior leader to do so.

“Although we had no idea that he had such plans, our party will back any genuine attempt by committed individuals to fight for the rights of the farmers,” state Congress head Rita Bahuguna Joshi praised the “selfless dedication” of Gunjan Joshi towards the cause of poor farmers.

Gunjan or GG will start his padyatra from the local Ambedkar Park on Sunday 10.00 AM. He has already been in talks with local news reporters of various national television channels to “get it right”. At the end of his journey, which he calls a “youth movement”, GG hopes to win higher compensation for farmers in Bhatta Parsaul and a chance to meet Rahul Gandhi.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gov-cool-with-corrupt-and-criminal-babas-till-they-dont-get-into-politics-1746,"New Delhi. Government of India has clarified that that it didn’t give a hoot for various crooks and criminals masquerading as godmen and gurus till they kept off politics. The clarification has been welcomed by all political parties and leaders of the nation hope that such babas would continue doing what they are good at – sleight of hand, spreading superstition, sheltering criminals, money laundering, and sex scandals – and not interfere in their domain.

“Did we arrest anyone for preaching that having a black dog in the north-west corner of the house will get rid of financial troubles? Or did we ever call anyone claiming himself as god as some sort of thug?” argued Congress speaker Janardan Dwivedi, rejecting the criticism that Congress was anti-baba because of its recent and relentless campaign against Baba Ramdev.

Government says that babas can appear on national television, keep on practicing and preaching bullshit with impunity, but shouldn’t enter politics.

“In fact, many of us follow such babas and consult them before filing nominations for elections,” Dwivedi clarified, “We love what babas do, but we have problems when they try to get into our space. That’s not what babas are supposed to do.”

Dwivedi further pointed out that a highly controversial godman like Chandraswami had been the spiritual guru of many Congress leaders till he was suspected of being involved in Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination.

“Don’t target the family and don’t get into politics is all we are asking these guys,” Dwivedi added.

BJP too has welcomed the clarification and hoped that various babas will “get the message” continue doing the “good work” instead of trying to act like a proactive opposition party.

However, experts believe that babas of the country might not settle for this compromise formula and the country could see more clashes between babas and netas (politicians) in future.

“See, first it happened with politicians and criminals, once the criminals realized that why should they stick to booth capturing and intimidating voters on behalf of some politician when they could do those for themselves,” social scientist Parikshit said, “Babas too seem to have realized that they were equally good at fooling people and yet appearing as caring for them – hallmark of a politician – so they would surely fancy their chances in politics.”

“The stiff competition from criminals pushed the leaders to make some laws that barred criminals from contesting elections, but no such laws exist for babas,” Parikshit pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/India_TV-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gov-cool-with-corrupt-and-criminal-babas-till-they-dont-get-into-politics-1746,Government cool with corrupt and criminal babas till they don’t get into politics,,1307949319.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-threatens-to-raise-an-army-of-11000-bullshitters-1740,"New Delhi. After Baba Ramdev threatened to raise an army of 11000 young men well trained in martial arts, Congress leader Digvijay Singh has threatened to counter him by raising his own army of 11000 young men well trained in vocal farts. These men, personally picked and trained by the Congress general secretary, will not only oppose Ramdev’s army, but will aim to frustrate and annihilate any person having a different point of view.

“Each one of my bullshitter will have the capacity to mindfuck thousands of Ramdev’s half-naked yogis or Anna’s candle carrying protestors,” Digvijay Singh claimed in a press conference, announcing his grand plans to raise an army of bullshitting men, tentatively named “D-Men”, on the lines of X-Men.

“Yes, we can!” said Digvijay Singh, assuring his followers that bullshitting was not so difficult if one tried.

Unlike X-Men, the D-Men won’t be any mutants having biological superpowers. They would be ordinary human beings with extra-ordinary bullshitting skills, unmatched by even the most professional and jobless trolls on the interwebs.

“Just imagine 11000 Digvijay Singhs,” the Congress general secretary explained his grand plans and threatened of the consequences.

Mr. Singh clarified that his plans, although announced to counter Ramdev’s army, were not hinged on Baba Ramdev’s plans, and that he was most certainly going to raise this army even if Baba backed off from his own plans.

The former Madhya Pradesh CM further clarified that he was raising this army not to assault anyone but to attack someone.

“What bullshit!” responded a journalist after hearing the above statement. The journalist, instantly recognized as an RSS agent, was later bashed up and kicked by Digvijay Singh and other journalists present at the press conference.

Post the assault on the journalist, the press conference resumed and Digvijay Singh announced that a public audition to shortlist promising young bullshitters from India would be held soon, and a selected few would be trained to attain perfection in this art.

The announcement by Diggy Raja has expectedly snowballed into a political controversy with BJP threatening to raise its own army of bullshitters under the able leadership of Navjot Singh Siddhu.

In a shocking claim about the head of the Council of Ministers, the two-in-one cabinet minister of telecommunications and HRD, Kapil Sibal has claimed that the post of Prime Minister in India was “notional” and in reality Prime Minister did not exist.

However, Mr. Sibal clarified that it didn’t mean that there was no government in India or there was no individual called Dr. Manmohan Singh.

“Of course there is a government and there is an order of law in this country,” Sibal said in a press conference which was boycotted by all shoe-throwers of the country. “But if you ask about Prime Minister, well, it’s a notional post. We realized that duties of a Prime Minister could be discharged even without having one.”

Kapil Sibal looks at a journalist who appeared unconvinced about his assertions

Sibal further disclosed that National Advisory Council (NAC), the group of advisors that gives some direction to the Council of Ministers in absence of a real Prime Minister, had even proposed to do away with the post of Prime Minister as part of the “austerity drive” and save the government myriad expenses like PM’s salary and PMO’s electricity bills.

“It was an excellent and practical suggestion! But it would have needed some fundamental changes in constitution before implementation. BJP, the notional opposition party, might not have agreed for this constitutional change so we decided to continue with one,” Sibal informed, reiterating that the country and the cabinet could function even without a Prime Minister.

When asked by Faking News about Dr. Manmohan Singh, who is widely regarded as the Prime Minister of India, Sibal confirmed that Dr. Singh existed and was part of the government.

“Dr. Singh is the Chairman of the Planning Commission, an extra-constitution and non-statutory body like NAC,” Sibal informed, “That’s a real post, and is often referred to the Prime Minister of India by the constitution and media.”

Sibal, however, refused to draw parallels between Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of NAC and Manmohan Singh, the Chairperson of Planning Commission, arguing that the duties and responsibilities of both were “fundamentally different”.

Impressed with his impeccable record of helping his current organization i.e. Congress in dealing with criticism and public attack, mobile services company Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh to become the head of its Customer Care operations.

Vodafone took this step after it drew flak for its decision to sue a customer, who posted negative things about the company on Facebook.

“I think if Digvijay Singh were with us, he would have openly declared that customer a thug and an Airtel agent trying to defame our company,” Vodafone India CEO Kapil Birbal said, explaining why the telecom services company made a job offer to Digvijay Singh.

Digvijay Singh reacts when asked if any private company can afford him

Vodafone CEO also clarified that Digvijay Singh’s persona was in keeping with the two popular customer care icons of the company – Cheeka, the pug, and Zoozoo, the egg-headed rounded creature.

“He follows Rahul Gandhi wherever he goes, like Cheeka used to do, and he speaks in a language that can be interpreted in many ways, something we thought was very much like Zoozoos,” Vodafone CEO explained the cultural fit Digvijay Singh had with the company.

“He is always ‘Happy to Help’ people who employ him,” the CEO said, referring to the customer care tagline of his company.

“Furthermore, we all know he loves talking on telephones and mobiles,” he added.

It’s not yet clear what kind of compensation Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh for rendering his professional services, but the company’s HR department made it clear that Diggy Raja didn’t need to give up his job of a politician to join the company.

“It’s not necessary to give up politics to do something else,” Vodafone’s HR head clarified to Faking News when pointed out that Digvijay Singh had asked Baba Ramdev to give up yoga if he wanted to enter politics.

The mobile company is confident that with Digvijay Singh on their side, they will not only be able to reject all criticism from the public, but also get some free publicity, for which they had to pay through their nose during the IPL.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-to-do-a-prison-break-to-rescue-kanimozhi-from-tihar-jail-1701,"New Delhi. If sources are to be believed then India is all set to witness its own real life version of the Prison Break. This time it will be the DMK head Karunanidhi who will do a Scofield to help his daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi escape from the Tihar Jail.

It should be noted that Prison Break was a famous American TV serial drama in which Scofield rescues his brother out of a prison by staging a bank robbery and getting himself to be arrested and sent to the same prison where his brother has been held until execution on false charges.

Fearing that the option of staging a bank robbery might turn out to be a process in futility as the country’s treasury has already been robbed off with the 2G scam, Karunanidhi is planning to stage a robbery of Rahul Gandhi’s most cherished possession of Italian actress Monica Bellucci’s original pic signed by her.

Inside the jail, Kani has already been informed of the plan.

“Due to lack of court date on Sunday, Kani was relaxing in her cell flipping between Sun and Kalaignar TV while dunking Parle-G biscuits in tea, when she got a visitor. Immediately after she was allegedly told about the plan, I saw her secretly summoning her neighboring cell-mates Madhuri Gupta and Sonu Punjaban,” said the jail warden who was later suspended for allegedly humming the Raja Ko Rani Se Pyaar Ho Gaya tune.

Karunanidhi is reported to have smiled over the idea after being glum for many days over the election defeat and arrest of his daughter.

The suspended warden claims that Kani has finalized the role assignment for the escape job on the big day. Madhuri Gupta will grab the role of spying on the prison faculties and Sonu Punjaban will get the job of accepting money from Kani and arranging for the necessary resources.

At one stage Kani had even included Kalmadi, currently residing in Jail number 4 to provide the logistics for the escape but later he was eased out from the plan. It is believed that the pole-vault that Kalmadi procured for prison break, at five times the market price, turned out to be of a very low quality and broke as soon as they tried to jump off in the trial escape.

A senior DMK leader, on condition of anonymity told Faking News, “Kalaignar is confident of pulling this off as much as he is confident of winning the next assembly elections. Besides, compared to the Scofield, Kalaignar has a larger surface area to offer for the tattoo. In fact we are even planning to use the extra area to add the route map of the Tihar Jail canteen where Kalaignar can have his favorite sambar rice and curd in the mid of escape if the glucose levels go down.”

Since the rescue-plan has already been leaked, Delhi police is under tremendous pressure to prevent the successful execution of the plan. Savdhaan Singh, senior inspector at the Tihar jail said, “All the security guards have been given a month leave to watch closely all the episodes of How I Met Your Mother.”

Later, it was found out that a little “oversight” on the part of jail intelligence agencies had caused this goof-up between the television series.

And just in case jail authorities succeed in watching the right series, there is a back-up plan.

“In event of failure, Appa has planned to come out with the truth and name all the big guns involved in the scam. The government could then be forced to ask Supreme Court, which is currently driving the CBI to probe the 2G scam, to stop interfering in the powers of the executive and let the law take its own course,” the DMK source revealed.

Indian politics at the moment looks like a flick straight out of the Rajshri production house with Didi (Mamata Banerjee), Amma (Jayalalithaa), Behenji (Mayawati) and Aunty (Shiela Dixit) in lead roles. While India celebrates the success of these four powerful women ruling some of India’s most populous states, Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is also known as Netaji, has decided to go for a complete makeover.

“With the blessings of Madam (Sonia Gandhi), I have decided to form an alliance with Behenji and become a Bhaiyyaji,” said a rejuvenated Mulayam who has been, for quite some time now, on the wrong side of Mayawati and CM’s post.

Sliding into an introspective mood, Mulayam ponders, “Look, it’s quite clear looking at those four lady CMs that people like leaders who have nicknames that remind them of their blood relatives. And I have been wondering if distributing money during elections or magic of muscle power was on the wane. Thank god I realized this before changing my original ways.”

Mulayam could re-launch himself with such old pictures in an attempt to rebrand himself

“Sure. Why not? I think my Pappa can become a very good Bhaiyyaji. We’d have realized it much earlier but that Amar Singh confused us by bringing in Munnabhai, who clearly was more of a bhai than bhaiyya,” said Mulayam’s son Akhilesh Yadav, whom friends fondly call Microsoft (Chhota Mulayam).

However, Mulayam’s decision has drawn a strong reaction from the MNS chief Raj Thackeray, who wrote in his column “United India”: Aamcha paksh konatyahi bhaiyachya navala Ji lavnar naay, aani yachi mee guarantee deto (My party will ensure that no Bhaiyya ever gets the honorific Ji behind his/her name. I guarantee that!)

Mulayam’s decision has also left the likes of Lalu Prasad Yadav in a fix, not able to decide upon a suitable family-name, which would get them an entry into the New World Order.

Always at a statement away from controversy, our very own Diggy Raja said, “Trusting people with names indicating blood relations prove that people believe in family power. That and only that is the reason why Congress always sticks to the Gandhi family.”

Last heard, Digvijay Singh was summoned by the Congress high command for the third time in a space of 24 hours.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalithaa-sends-free-mixer-grinder-to-karunanidhi-wives-1673,"Chennai. In a humble gesture after her landslide victory, AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa has decided to gift free mixer-grinders to the wives of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi as part of the implementation of her party’s manifesto. Amma had promised to provide free mixer-grinder to women and free bus passes to senior citizens to travel within and nearby towns.

A free bus pass could be given to Karunanidhi too while a ceiling fan is in pipeline for A Raja in Tihar jail, but a formal announcement is pending on these two.

DMK believes that Jayalalithaa’s friendly gesture could be a deadly trap

“Amma wants to start her new term on a humble and pleasant note, unlike last time when she got Karunanidhi arrested in the midnight,” an AIADMK spokesman confirmed, “She has no ill-will towards the DMK family and is willing to treat them as equal citizens of Tamil Nadu. In fact, through this step, she has felicitated the family.”

Party sources claim that Jayalalithaa was sending out a message that she’d be completely non-partisan while implementing her election manifesto promises. Sources further claimed that the step also went on to prove that the promised goodies in the manifesto were not any type of “bribe”, as has been criticized by many commentators.

“That would have been a bribe if we had given them only to those who had voted for Amma, clearly the wives of Karunanidhi didn’t vote for AIADMK, unless you can prove the contrary,” the party spokesman argued, “See, we are not giving any mixer-grinder, ceiling fan, or laptop to Rajinikanth, who was reported as having voted for Amma. It’s not any bribe.”

“Rajinikanth doesn’t need any fans of course,” the spokesman cracked a PJ, reflecting the mood in the AIADMK camp.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,"New Delhi. Congress leader and former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh has made India proud by becoming the first human being on earth to get an ISO certification for his integrity.

Diggy Raja, as he is fondly called, now has an ISO 9001:2008 certificate for his integrity, which means now he can officially question anyone’s integrity without worrying about defamation suits, unless of course the other person too has ISO certified integrity.

“We took the decision after observing him in the last two-three years,” informed Mr. Sharad Pawar, Union Minister for Agriculture, who is also the head of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), a member body of the International Organization for Standardization that determines the standards for ISO certification.

Digvijay Singh is seen happy here after receiving the certificate on his integrity

Sharad Pawar further informed that Digvijay Singh had been “under observation” for the last couple of years after he started questioning the authenticity, credibility and integrity of events, institutions and individuals.

Soon after, BIS officials realized that there has been a “standard pattern” in what Digvijay Singh said or questioned, and his actions were very “system driven” that always satisfied a set of “patrons”; something that qualified him for getting a certificate under the ISO 9000 family of standards.

“He was awarded ISO 9001:2008 as 2008 was the years after which his standards were set,” said Sharad Pawar, who also clarified that an approval by BIS meant that Digvijay was also eligible for an “ISI mark” on his integrity.

Following the certification, Digvijay Singh has arguably become the most upright person in India right now, something that might make him eligible for the post of “Jan Lokpal”, but Diggy Raja denied that he had any such ambitions.

“I don’t want any posts, I’m happy with this certificate that proves that I faithfully adhere to the standards of family,” Digvijay Singh said in a press conference accepting the certificate from Mr. Pawar.

“I meant family of standards,” he later clarified.

Digvijay Singh also said that he’d soon release an ISO certified CD of the conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh, which will put the controversy to rest.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/digvijay-250x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,Digvijay Singh becomes first man to have ISO certified integrity,,1303460593.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-laughs-out-loud-at-ranbir-kapoor-docomo-joke-1780,"New Delhi. In a rare occasion involving public display of emotions and non-silence, Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh abandoned his usual impassive and quiet demeanor and went LOL (laughing out loud) at one of the jokes cracked by Ranbir Kapoor during DoCoMo television ads. The unbridled laughter, which lasted for 30 seconds i.e. as long as the ad, was recorded early today when PM was watching television to pass time before cabinet reshuffle.

“Ho ho ho, ha ha ha, oh man!” Prime Minister loudly uttered these words for the first time in office, bringing the PMO to a standstill. At least three special secretaries of IAS rank and ten housekeeping staff are reported to have rushed into the office of PM to check if everything was alright.

“Hahaha… Have you guys seen this? This is so funny!” Dr. Singh is reported to have told the just-in officers pointing towards the television that had started showing Bhaarat Nirmaan ad by then.

“No, no, not this one, those Ranbir Kapoor ads,” Prime Minister clarified in a hurry to a dumbfounded PMO staff.

The man who made the PM break his silence?

After fifteen minutes of unprecedented consistent talking, which included showering praise for the copywriter of the ad and National Awards worthy performance by the Bollywood heartthrob, Prime Minister is reported to have asked all the assembled members of the PMO staff to watch all the DoCoMo stand-up ads by Ranbir Kapoor and ‘like’ all the pages related the actor on Facebook.

“I am still shocked,” an officer in the PMO said on conditions of anonymity, “Prime Minister had never shown such outspokenness and liveliness ever before. He never even asked us to ‘like’ Congress or Rahul Gandhi pages on Facebook. And laughing out loud!? My god, is this real? Pinch me and tell me I’m not dreaming!”

It’s not yet known what caused this dramatic transformation in Prime Minister, who recently announced that he would be talking to journalists each week to dispel the myth that he was a passive or puppet Prime Minister.

“I think PM has taken this responsibility of changing his public image a tad too seriously,” a television expert on everything told Faking News, “He talked at length on some issues with editors yesterday and it seems he is going to talk on any issue with anyone from now on.”

Further investigations by Faking News into the mysterious event at PMO revealed that Prime Minister had seen the “No auto activation: Maa” stand-up ad where Ranbir Kapoor says “aye le aaloo ka paraantha, aye le caller tune” in a Punjabi accent comparing a mother with a mobile service provider, who impose their own choices on a person without even asking or waiting for his or her approval.

Unconfirmed reports say that one of the PMO staff, goaded by PM’s lively mood, tried to improvise the joke and compared the mother in the ad with Sonia Gandhi. He is reported to have said, “aye le Finance Minister, aye le Home Minister” apparently referring to the impending cabinet reshuffle and other decisions by the PMO.

The officer has been suspended for six weeks, sources say.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tata_docomo-250x190.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-laughs-out-loud-at-ranbir-kapoor-docomo-joke-1780,Manmohan Singh laughs out loud at Ranbir Kapoor’s DoCoMo joke,,1309408858.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mighty pissed off with random statements from random Congress leaders criticizing the government led by him, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked those leaders to either keep their mouth shut or come up with some other nonsense that doesn’t target him or his government.

Sources at PMO inform that Dr. Singh is mighty irritated with his party taking credit for all the good work done by him, while not sharing the blame for the unpopular decisions taken by the UPA government led by Congress.

“Prime Minister had thrown a paperweight against his office wall in anger when he read news reports where Congress had distanced itself from the Congress led government’s decision of sending four ministers, all of them members of the Congress party, to receive Baba Ramdev at airport,” a PMO source informed.

Manmohan Singh thinking about his party

“He was annoyed that while media calls him a puppet prime minister, such asinine decisions were directly attributed to him as if he took all the decisions by the government independently,” the source said.

Already irritated, Dr. Singh is reported to have gone in a total bad mood when he read news reports about Digvijay Singh wanting Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister.

“What kind of crap is being thrown at me daily? And why on earth me? What the hell have I done?” normally silent and calm Manmohan Singh is reported to have written in a letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi, the President of Congress, after he couldn’t take it anymore.

“I mean, how the hell is Congress not responsible for anything that my government does? For god’s sake, the whole union cabinet is almost made up of only Congress members!” the former RBI governor is said to have argued, without referring to any decisions being taken by Sonia Gandhi.

“The DMK ministers are in jail or on the way, the Trinamool ministers are still having party in Kolkata, the NCP ministers are busy managing their own businesses; that leaves only Congress ministers actively taking part in cabinet meetings, and yet Congress is not responsible for government actions?” Manmohan Singh explained his arguments.

“Don’t give me that shit again,” he said.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Mainpuri. On his birthday that also happens to be Father’s Day, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi has declared that he’d adopt a dalit girl child and become her foster father. Rahul has adopted the same eight-year-old girl, with whom he had ridden a buffalo around three years ago while on his expeditions to Uttar Pradesh to discover the other India. The girl’s name is Maya Kumari.

“Our office received a fax from Switzerland, where Rahulji and Soniaji are currently holidaying, apprising us of Rahul Baba’s decision. Little Maya’s father had passed away in her childhood and her mother had tough time raising her; she even resorted to selling her to a rich man in Ambedkarnagar. Mayawati government didn’t help her at all so our party decided to step in,” local Congress leader Sapna Merchant informed.

According to Sapna, Little Maya will now fly to New Delhi with Congress general secretary and live with Rahul Gandhi at his official residence. She will also get to study in the best of the schools and colleges in India and abroad. Rahul has promised to her that her dream of becoming a nuclear scientist will get realized one day, and he’d be a proud father then.

Rahul Gandhi’s love for children, a newsworthy piece of information that could be linked to Chacha Nehru, could now come into limelight in the mainstream media following the latest decision by Rahul.

While Congress claims that the whole village is happy with this good news, reports suggest that a few villagers were unhappy with what they called “preferential treatment” given to one child. It should be noted (refer to this report) that Rahul Gandhi had gone on a buffalo ride with two kids, the other being equally unfortunate to be living in poverty.

“Why was the other kid, the boy Naram Yadav, left to fend for his own? Rahul made use of him when he wanted to ride a buffalo and now he doesn’t even care to visit his house. Why this special treatment to Maya? This is politics of the worst kind,” Shishupal, an angry villager claimed.

Not only villagers like Shishupal, Rahul’s apparently benevolent act has riled even Mayawati, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Maya has accused Rahul of being a ‘naatakbaaz’ like Mahatma Gandhi, who had no genuine intentions to help dalits. She further claimed that the whole act was a conspiracy to defraud dalits of their rights and identity.

“This dramabaaz Gandhi has deliberately chosen my namesake to insult me and hence the whole dalit community. He wants to finish dalits! Now that dalit girl will no longer remain a dalit because caste of a person is the same as his or her father’s caste. In essence, Rahul Gandhi has only reduced the population and weakened the strength of dalits,” Mayawati alleged.

Mayawati also announced a “chheen lo” (snatch them) movement on this occasion asking all dalit families to take back their sons and daughters who might have been adopted or being raised by Congress workers in recent years.

But the government at center has rejected and ridiculed Mayawati’s allegations and lauded Rahul Gandhi for adopting a girl child. The union minister for Women and Child Development has announced a full page color advertisement in all the leading national dailies to appreciate Rahul’s noble act and message.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Rahul_Gandhi_with_a_kid-237x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-adopts-dalit-child-on-fathers-day-mayawati-furious-1756,"Rahul Gandhi adopts dalit child on Father’s Day, Mayawati furious",,1308470188.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-worker-tattoos-body-with-rahul-gandhi-pics-to-support-farmers-rights-1754,"Lucknow. A young Congress worker has got his whole body tattooed with Rahul Gandhi’s name and images, presumably to create awareness on farmers’ rights in the state. 28-year-old Gunjan Joshi claims that his daring act will instill confidence in the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, who are under murderous attack from the tyrannous regime of Mayawati.

Gunjan, now being called “Godna Gandhi” or GG for having tattoos all over his body, will undertake a padyatra (on foot journey) in support of farmers’ rights on 19th June – the birthday of Rahul Gandhi, which will be celebrated as “Kisan Adhikar Divas” or Farmers’ Rights Day by the state unit of Congress party.

“Rahul Baba has sacrificed a lot for the farmers of this country, especially those in Uttar Pradesh,” Gunjan said, attracting huge applause from the fellow Congress workers, “This is the minimum that the citizens of India should do to express their gratitude. I hope the youth of this country would join me.”

A farmer from Uttar Pradesh, whose fortunes chould soon change due to the mass awareness campaign launched by the Congress worker.

Gunjan strongly refuted allegations that his act smacked of sycophancy and a desperate act to please Rahul Gandhi, who many consider as Prime Minister-in-waiting.

“Getting tattoos on body is no sycophancy,” GG argued, “People around the world use it to portray priorities in their lives. I have done the same.”

“My priority is to get farmers of Uttar Pradesh justice,” he clarified.

When asked how name and images of Rahul Gandhi on his body could deliver justice to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Gunjan dismissed such concerns as “cynical” and a “conspiracy” by communal forces to weaken his strong resolve.

State unit of Congress, which has been busy getting posters of Rahul Gandhi printed and pasted in time to celebrate the Farmers’ Rights Day, confirmed that whatever Gunjan had done was a decision taken in a personal capacity and the hitherto unknown Congress worker was not advised by any senior leader to do so.

“Although we had no idea that he had such plans, our party will back any genuine attempt by committed individuals to fight for the rights of the farmers,” state Congress head Rita Bahuguna Joshi praised the “selfless dedication” of Gunjan Joshi towards the cause of poor farmers.

Gunjan or GG will start his padyatra from the local Ambedkar Park on Sunday 10.00 AM. He has already been in talks with local news reporters of various national television channels to “get it right”. At the end of his journey, which he calls a “youth movement”, GG hopes to win higher compensation for farmers in Bhatta Parsaul and a chance to meet Rahul Gandhi.

Government of India has clarified that that it didn’t give a hoot for various crooks and criminals masquerading as godmen and gurus till they kept off politics. The clarification has been welcomed by all political parties and leaders of the nation hope that such babas would continue doing what they are good at – sleight of hand, spreading superstition, sheltering criminals, money laundering, and sex scandals – and not interfere in their domain.

“Did we arrest anyone for preaching that having a black dog in the north-west corner of the house will get rid of financial troubles? Or did we ever call anyone claiming himself as god as some sort of thug?” argued Congress speaker Janardan Dwivedi, rejecting the criticism that Congress was anti-baba because of its recent and relentless campaign against Baba Ramdev.

Government says that babas can appear on national television, keep on practicing and preaching bullshit with impunity, but shouldn’t enter politics.

“In fact, many of us follow such babas and consult them before filing nominations for elections,” Dwivedi clarified, “We love what babas do, but we have problems when they try to get into our space. That’s not what babas are supposed to do.”

Dwivedi further pointed out that a highly controversial godman like Chandraswami had been the spiritual guru of many Congress leaders till he was suspected of being involved in Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination.

“Don’t target the family and don’t get into politics is all we are asking these guys,” Dwivedi added.

BJP too has welcomed the clarification and hoped that various babas will “get the message” continue doing the “good work” instead of trying to act like a proactive opposition party.

However, experts believe that babas of the country might not settle for this compromise formula and the country could see more clashes between babas and netas (politicians) in future.

“See, first it happened with politicians and criminals, once the criminals realized that why should they stick to booth capturing and intimidating voters on behalf of some politician when they could do those for themselves,” social scientist Parikshit said, “Babas too seem to have realized that they were equally good at fooling people and yet appearing as caring for them – hallmark of a politician – so they would surely fancy their chances in politics.”

“The stiff competition from criminals pushed the leaders to make some laws that barred criminals from contesting elections, but no such laws exist for babas,” Parikshit pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/India_TV-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gov-cool-with-corrupt-and-criminal-babas-till-they-dont-get-into-politics-1746,Government cool with corrupt and criminal babas till they don’t get into politics,,1307949319.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Baba Ramdev threatened to raise an army of 11000 young men well trained in martial arts, Congress leader Digvijay Singh has threatened to counter him by raising his own army of 11000 young men well trained in vocal farts. These men, personally picked and trained by the Congress general secretary, will not only oppose Ramdev’s army, but will aim to frustrate and annihilate any person having a different point of view.

“Each one of my bullshitter will have the capacity to mindfuck thousands of Ramdev’s half-naked yogis or Anna’s candle carrying protestors,” Digvijay Singh claimed in a press conference, announcing his grand plans to raise an army of bullshitting men, tentatively named “D-Men”, on the lines of X-Men.

“Yes, we can!” said Digvijay Singh, assuring his followers that bullshitting was not so difficult if one tried.

Unlike X-Men, the D-Men won’t be any mutants having biological superpowers. They would be ordinary human beings with extra-ordinary bullshitting skills, unmatched by even the most professional and jobless trolls on the interwebs.

“Just imagine 11000 Digvijay Singhs,” the Congress general secretary explained his grand plans and threatened of the consequences.

Mr. Singh clarified that his plans, although announced to counter Ramdev’s army, were not hinged on Baba Ramdev’s plans, and that he was most certainly going to raise this army even if Baba backed off from his own plans.

The former Madhya Pradesh CM further clarified that he was raising this army not to assault anyone but to attack someone.

“What bullshit!” responded a journalist after hearing the above statement. The journalist, instantly recognized as an RSS agent, was later bashed up and kicked by Digvijay Singh and other journalists present at the press conference.

Post the assault on the journalist, the press conference resumed and Digvijay Singh announced that a public audition to shortlist promising young bullshitters from India would be held soon, and a selected few would be trained to attain perfection in this art.

The announcement by Diggy Raja has expectedly snowballed into a political controversy with BJP threatening to raise its own army of bullshitters under the able leadership of Navjot Singh Siddhu.

In a shocking claim about the head of the Council of Ministers, the two-in-one cabinet minister of telecommunications and HRD, Kapil Sibal has claimed that the post of Prime Minister in India was “notional” and in reality Prime Minister did not exist.

However, Mr. Sibal clarified that it didn’t mean that there was no government in India or there was no individual called Dr. Manmohan Singh.

“Of course there is a government and there is an order of law in this country,” Sibal said in a press conference which was boycotted by all shoe-throwers of the country. “But if you ask about Prime Minister, well, it’s a notional post. We realized that duties of a Prime Minister could be discharged even without having one.”

Kapil Sibal looks at a journalist who appeared unconvinced about his assertions

Sibal further disclosed that National Advisory Council (NAC), the group of advisors that gives some direction to the Council of Ministers in absence of a real Prime Minister, had even proposed to do away with the post of Prime Minister as part of the “austerity drive” and save the government myriad expenses like PM’s salary and PMO’s electricity bills.

“It was an excellent and practical suggestion! But it would have needed some fundamental changes in constitution before implementation. BJP, the notional opposition party, might not have agreed for this constitutional change so we decided to continue with one,” Sibal informed, reiterating that the country and the cabinet could function even without a Prime Minister.

When asked by Faking News about Dr. Manmohan Singh, who is widely regarded as the Prime Minister of India, Sibal confirmed that Dr. Singh existed and was part of the government.

“Dr. Singh is the Chairman of the Planning Commission, an extra-constitution and non-statutory body like NAC,” Sibal informed, “That’s a real post, and is often referred to the Prime Minister of India by the constitution and media.”

Sibal, however, refused to draw parallels between Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of NAC and Manmohan Singh, the Chairperson of Planning Commission, arguing that the duties and responsibilities of both were “fundamentally different”.

Impressed with his impeccable record of helping his current organization i.e. Congress in dealing with criticism and public attack, mobile services company Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh to become the head of its Customer Care operations.

Vodafone took this step after it drew flak for its decision to sue a customer, who posted negative things about the company on Facebook.

“I think if Digvijay Singh were with us, he would have openly declared that customer a thug and an Airtel agent trying to defame our company,” Vodafone India CEO Kapil Birbal said, explaining why the telecom services company made a job offer to Digvijay Singh.

Digvijay Singh reacts when asked if any private company can afford him

Vodafone CEO also clarified that Digvijay Singh’s persona was in keeping with the two popular customer care icons of the company – Cheeka, the pug, and Zoozoo, the egg-headed rounded creature.

“He follows Rahul Gandhi wherever he goes, like Cheeka used to do, and he speaks in a language that can be interpreted in many ways, something we thought was very much like Zoozoos,” Vodafone CEO explained the cultural fit Digvijay Singh had with the company.

“He is always ‘Happy to Help’ people who employ him,” the CEO said, referring to the customer care tagline of his company.

“Furthermore, we all know he loves talking on telephones and mobiles,” he added.

It’s not yet clear what kind of compensation Vodafone has offered Digvijay Singh for rendering his professional services, but the company’s HR department made it clear that Diggy Raja didn’t need to give up his job of a politician to join the company.

“It’s not necessary to give up politics to do something else,” Vodafone’s HR head clarified to Faking News when pointed out that Digvijay Singh had asked Baba Ramdev to give up yoga if he wanted to enter politics.

The mobile company is confident that with Digvijay Singh on their side, they will not only be able to reject all criticism from the public, but also get some free publicity, for which they had to pay through their nose during the IPL.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/karunanidhi-to-do-a-prison-break-to-rescue-kanimozhi-from-tihar-jail-1701,"New Delhi. If sources are to be believed then India is all set to witness its own real life version of the Prison Break. This time it will be the DMK head Karunanidhi who will do a Scofield to help his daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi escape from the Tihar Jail.

It should be noted that Prison Break was a famous American TV serial drama in which Scofield rescues his brother out of a prison by staging a bank robbery and getting himself to be arrested and sent to the same prison where his brother has been held until execution on false charges.

Fearing that the option of staging a bank robbery might turn out to be a process in futility as the country’s treasury has already been robbed off with the 2G scam, Karunanidhi is planning to stage a robbery of Rahul Gandhi’s most cherished possession of Italian actress Monica Bellucci’s original pic signed by her.

Inside the jail, Kani has already been informed of the plan.

“Due to lack of court date on Sunday, Kani was relaxing in her cell flipping between Sun and Kalaignar TV while dunking Parle-G biscuits in tea, when she got a visitor. Immediately after she was allegedly told about the plan, I saw her secretly summoning her neighboring cell-mates Madhuri Gupta and Sonu Punjaban,” said the jail warden who was later suspended for allegedly humming the Raja Ko Rani Se Pyaar Ho Gaya tune.

Karunanidhi is reported to have smiled over the idea after being glum for many days over the election defeat and arrest of his daughter.

The suspended warden claims that Kani has finalized the role assignment for the escape job on the big day. Madhuri Gupta will grab the role of spying on the prison faculties and Sonu Punjaban will get the job of accepting money from Kani and arranging for the necessary resources.

At one stage Kani had even included Kalmadi, currently residing in Jail number 4 to provide the logistics for the escape but later he was eased out from the plan. It is believed that the pole-vault that Kalmadi procured for prison break, at five times the market price, turned out to be of a very low quality and broke as soon as they tried to jump off in the trial escape.

A senior DMK leader, on condition of anonymity told Faking News, “Kalaignar is confident of pulling this off as much as he is confident of winning the next assembly elections. Besides, compared to the Scofield, Kalaignar has a larger surface area to offer for the tattoo. In fact we are even planning to use the extra area to add the route map of the Tihar Jail canteen where Kalaignar can have his favorite sambar rice and curd in the mid of escape if the glucose levels go down.”

Since the rescue-plan has already been leaked, Delhi police is under tremendous pressure to prevent the successful execution of the plan. Savdhaan Singh, senior inspector at the Tihar jail said, “All the security guards have been given a month leave to watch closely all the episodes of How I Met Your Mother.”

Later, it was found out that a little “oversight” on the part of jail intelligence agencies had caused this goof-up between the television series.

And just in case jail authorities succeed in watching the right series, there is a back-up plan.

“In event of failure, Appa has planned to come out with the truth and name all the big guns involved in the scam. The government could then be forced to ask Supreme Court, which is currently driving the CBI to probe the 2G scam, to stop interfering in the powers of the executive and let the law take its own course,” the DMK source revealed.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/inspired-by-behenji-and-didi-mulayam-decides-to-call-himself-bhaiyyaji-1693,"Lucknow. Indian politics at the moment looks like a flick straight out of the Rajshri production house with Didi (Mamata Banerjee), Amma (Jayalalithaa), Behenji (Mayawati) and Aunty (Shiela Dixit) in lead roles. While India celebrates the success of these four powerful women ruling some of India’s most populous states, Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is also known as Netaji, has decided to go for a complete makeover.

“With the blessings of Madam (Sonia Gandhi), I have decided to form an alliance with Behenji and become a Bhaiyyaji,” said a rejuvenated Mulayam who has been, for quite some time now, on the wrong side of Mayawati and CM’s post.

Sliding into an introspective mood, Mulayam ponders, “Look, it’s quite clear looking at those four lady CMs that people like leaders who have nicknames that remind them of their blood relatives. And I have been wondering if distributing money during elections or magic of muscle power was on the wane. Thank god I realized this before changing my original ways.”

Mulayam could re-launch himself with such old pictures in an attempt to rebrand himself

“Sure. Why not? I think my Pappa can become a very good Bhaiyyaji. We’d have realized it much earlier but that Amar Singh confused us by bringing in Munnabhai, who clearly was more of a bhai than bhaiyya,” said Mulayam’s son Akhilesh Yadav, whom friends fondly call Microsoft (Chhota Mulayam).

However, Mulayam’s decision has drawn a strong reaction from the MNS chief Raj Thackeray, who wrote in his column “United India”: Aamcha paksh konatyahi bhaiyachya navala Ji lavnar naay, aani yachi mee guarantee deto (My party will ensure that no Bhaiyya ever gets the honorific Ji behind his/her name. I guarantee that!)

Mulayam’s decision has also left the likes of Lalu Prasad Yadav in a fix, not able to decide upon a suitable family-name, which would get them an entry into the New World Order.

Always at a statement away from controversy, our very own Diggy Raja said, “Trusting people with names indicating blood relations prove that people believe in family power. That and only that is the reason why Congress always sticks to the Gandhi family.”

Last heard, Digvijay Singh was summoned by the Congress high command for the third time in a space of 24 hours.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalithaa-sends-free-mixer-grinder-to-karunanidhi-wives-1673,"Chennai. In a humble gesture after her landslide victory, AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa has decided to gift free mixer-grinders to the wives of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi as part of the implementation of her party’s manifesto. Amma had promised to provide free mixer-grinder to women and free bus passes to senior citizens to travel within and nearby towns.

A free bus pass could be given to Karunanidhi too while a ceiling fan is in pipeline for A Raja in Tihar jail, but a formal announcement is pending on these two.

DMK believes that Jayalalithaa’s friendly gesture could be a deadly trap

“Amma wants to start her new term on a humble and pleasant note, unlike last time when she got Karunanidhi arrested in the midnight,” an AIADMK spokesman confirmed, “She has no ill-will towards the DMK family and is willing to treat them as equal citizens of Tamil Nadu. In fact, through this step, she has felicitated the family.”

Party sources claim that Jayalalithaa was sending out a message that she’d be completely non-partisan while implementing her election manifesto promises. Sources further claimed that the step also went on to prove that the promised goodies in the manifesto were not any type of “bribe”, as has been criticized by many commentators.

“That would have been a bribe if we had given them only to those who had voted for Amma, clearly the wives of Karunanidhi didn’t vote for AIADMK, unless you can prove the contrary,” the party spokesman argued, “See, we are not giving any mixer-grinder, ceiling fan, or laptop to Rajinikanth, who was reported as having voted for Amma. It’s not any bribe.”

“Rajinikanth doesn’t need any fans of course,” the spokesman cracked a PJ, reflecting the mood in the AIADMK camp.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,"New Delhi. Congress leader and former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh has made India proud by becoming the first human being on earth to get an ISO certification for his integrity.

Diggy Raja, as he is fondly called, now has an ISO 9001:2008 certificate for his integrity, which means now he can officially question anyone’s integrity without worrying about defamation suits, unless of course the other person too has ISO certified integrity.

“We took the decision after observing him in the last two-three years,” informed Mr. Sharad Pawar, Union Minister for Agriculture, who is also the head of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), a member body of the International Organization for Standardization that determines the standards for ISO certification.

Digvijay Singh is seen happy here after receiving the certificate on his integrity

Sharad Pawar further informed that Digvijay Singh had been “under observation” for the last couple of years after he started questioning the authenticity, credibility and integrity of events, institutions and individuals.

Soon after, BIS officials realized that there has been a “standard pattern” in what Digvijay Singh said or questioned, and his actions were very “system driven” that always satisfied a set of “patrons”; something that qualified him for getting a certificate under the ISO 9000 family of standards.

“He was awarded ISO 9001:2008 as 2008 was the years after which his standards were set,” said Sharad Pawar, who also clarified that an approval by BIS meant that Digvijay was also eligible for an “ISI mark” on his integrity.

Following the certification, Digvijay Singh has arguably become the most upright person in India right now, something that might make him eligible for the post of “Jan Lokpal”, but Diggy Raja denied that he had any such ambitions.

“I don’t want any posts, I’m happy with this certificate that proves that I faithfully adhere to the standards of family,” Digvijay Singh said in a press conference accepting the certificate from Mr. Pawar.

“I meant family of standards,” he later clarified.

Digvijay Singh also said that he’d soon release an ISO certified CD of the conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh, which will put the controversy to rest.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/digvijay-250x225.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/digvijay-singh-becomes-first-man-to-have-iso-certified-integrity-1618,Digvijay Singh becomes first man to have ISO certified integrity,,1303460593.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-article-on-corruption-published-in-champak-magazine-1610,"New Delhi. In a major embarrassment to the Congress party, an article written by its General Secretary Rahul Gandhi has been published by once popular children’s magazine Champak. The article deals with the currently hot topic of corruption in public life and it shows how a young lion named “Leo Baby” removed corruption from the jungle for good.

Sources tell Faking News that Rahul Gandhi had written the article last week after Anna Hazare started his fast against corruption and it was due to be published in the party newsletter, but somehow it got leaked to the publishers of Champak.

Future generations of India would now get to learn about corruption at a young age

“It’s a conspiracy to deride Rahul Baba,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh alleged, “The publishers of that magazine have clear leftist leanings and they know their favorite parties are going to lose in Kerala and Bengal, that’s why they have stooped to such cheap tactics.”

Digvijay Singh suspected the hand of communist leaders behind this “conspiracy” as the name “Leo Baby” sounded very similar to “Amul Baby”, a sobriquet given to Rahul Gandhi by veteran communist leader VS Achuthanandan.

“This article is not written at all by Rahul Baba,” Digvijay Singh further claimed, “The publishers have written it themselves and are trying to push up the sales of their magazine. My lawyer could call me anytime and soon I’d file a case against them.”

Digvijay Singh refused to comment over the possibility of the government banning Champak in a few states.

However the publishers of the magazine, Delhi Press, have claimed that the article was indeed written by Rahul Gandhi and it was delivered to their office in an official Congress envelop with the postage stamp paid by the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office).

“The article also talks of two jungles, aam jaanwar (common animals), and a deer called Hiranavati; so it totally looks authentic to us,” an official of Delhi Press told our reporter Chatur Chintu.

Interestingly, the Delhi Press official unwittingly conceded that the PMO envelop didn’t have any covering letter directing them to publish the article specifically in Champak among the 30-odd magazines that the group operates, but the editors took this decision.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-pawar-wants-benefit-of-doubt-in-all-cases-of-corruption-1604,"New Delhi. Taking a cue from the game of cricket where benefit of doubt is given to the batsmen, Sharad Pawar has suggested to the Lokpal bill drafting committee that benefit of doubt should be given to the politician in all cases of corruption. Pawar, who earlier resigned from the Group of Ministers formed to look into the finer aspects of the bill, wrote a letter to the media explaining his demand.

“There are allegations of corruption in each move a politician makes just like there are allegations of match-fixing in each cricket match that is played these days,” Pawar wrote in his letter, “And just like the batsman takes the center stage in a cricket match, a politician is at the center of every scam.”

Benefit of doubt is usually given to the batsmen

Based on this premise, the Agriculture Minister cum the ICC President has suggested that all the politicians should be given the benefit of doubt in all the cases of corruption. Under this “benefit” provision, it has been suggested that the proposed office of Lokpal should not initiate any proceedings or investigations against a politician if there was even a thread of doubt remaining in the corruption case.

Mr. Pawar claimed that many techniques of cricket were already being employed in cases of corruption and hence his demand was not very outlandish. He claimed that the CAG report on the 2G scam used a similar technique like the “Hawk-Eye” to assess the losses to the government exchequer.

“CAG calculated the revenue that the government could have generated had the path of competitive spectrum selling not been obstructed by A Raja. It’s very much similar to using Hawk-Eye to find out where the ball would have traveled had its path not been obstructed by the leg of the batsman,” Pawar claimed.

In his letter, Pawar didn’t comment over the findings revealed by either Hawk-Eye or the CAG, even as the latter was termed as “notional” by his colleague Kapil Sibal earlier; something that has given rise to fears that all LBW decisions going in favor of bowlers through UDRS could become doubtful if Sibal became the Sports Minister in the next cabinet reshuffle.

Meanwhile Sharad Pawar reported a mail from Faking News as “spam” after we asked him if Shahid Balwa was a substitute player or a runner for an injured batsman in his opinion.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/hawk-eye-250x185.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-pawar-wants-benefit-of-doubt-in-all-cases-of-corruption-1604,Sharad Pawar wants benefit of doubt in all cases of corruption,,1302863288.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-bought-things-at-inflated-prices-to-fight-war-against-corruption-1598,"New Delhi. In a shocking development, it has come to light that the government has bought an assortment of unnecessary things, ranging from war-tanks to beer-mugs, at inflated and unbelievable prices in name of fighting “war against corruption”. These things were bought in the last three days after social activist and Gandhian leader Anna Hazare started his fast unto death to protest corruption in civil life.

“WTF! Another scam!?” reacted Vivek, an anti-corruption activist, who had just returned from Jantar Mantar in Delhi where Hazare has been fasting.

Vivek’s fears are not unfounded as it surely looks like another scam with the government signing an order to buy a fleet of war-tanks from the US to fight war against corruption. Even as using tanks to fight such kind of a war looked as odd as it can get, Faking News was further shocked to learn that the tanks were sold to India at seven times higher rate than what US charges other countries, except Pakistan, where they are given free in aid.

Earlier in July 2010, Jyoti Devi, a Congress leader in Bihar assembly, had valiantly fought the war against corruption with flower pots.

Faking News’ frenetic attempts to contact defense ministry, which included two emails to contact@mod.nic.in and a missed call to the landline number given on the website, were returned with no success even as we further discovered that other departments too had indulged in similar deals to buy bizarre things in name of fighting corruption.

For example, at least 3000 beer mugs of 50,000 rupees each were bought by the Home Ministry to fight corruption, though the official there claimed that the mugs were bought so that juice could be offered in them to the fasting protestors at Jantar Mantar.

“Those are the normal rates we pay for buying housekeeping objects,” said the official, rejecting any malpractice or fraud in the purchase of the beer-mugs.

Similar outlandish things at puzzling prices were bought by various other government ministries, with the most bizarre being Kapil Sibal’s Telecommunications Ministry buying zoozoos to win the war against the corruption. Vodafone, which otherwise owes $ 2.5 billion to the government as unpaid taxes, would now be paid $ 3 billion by the government for handing over an “army” of 300 3G zoozoos.

Faking News didn’t bother to check what the Agriculture Ministry under Sharad Pawar was upto.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-asks-anna-hazare-to-tolerate-corruption-at-least-till-ipl-1592,"Mumbai. Social activist Anna Hazare, who for some inscrutable reason started talking about corruption and some funny sounding Jan Lokpal Bill between celebrations of world cup victory and build up to the IPL, has been asked by the Prime Minister to wait until after the IPL was over. Anna Hazare had earlier announced a fast unto death if the Parliament didn’t adopt the anti-corruption bill without diluting it.

“At least wait till the IPL was over gaddamnit!” a press statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) read, claiming to reflect the mood of the nation, duly represented by the parliamentarians.

“The country is happy, let them be, will you?” the statement further appealed to the 72-year-old activist, who deems corruption as the biggest threat to the Indian democracy.

Government is clueless why this man wants to eradicate corruption from the public life in India

Hazare, a Gandhian, wants the state and central government to set up offices of ombudsmen, independent of government control like the Election Commission, where common citizens can walk in without fear and register complaint against elected representatives and public servants for cases of corruption. The ombudsman will also have the power to prosecute those found guilty without waiting for government’s permission.

“That’s ridiculous,” said a minister on conditions of anonymity reacting to the provisions of the Jan Lokpal bill that is being supported by people like Kiran Bedi, RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal, and Baba Ramdev.

Due to its highly ridiculous nature, the government wants a Group of Ministers (GoM), under the able leadership of Sharad Pawar, to review the bill and “set it straight”.

The Jan Lokpal bill has been pending adoption by the parliament since it was first introduced in 1969 and was erroneously passed by the Lok Sabha, but failed to get pass the Rajya Sabha. The bill failed to pass on nine subsequent occasions after being mysteriously introduced in the parliament ever since, making it the longest pending bill, ahead of the Women’s Reservation Bill.

But Anna Hazare is hell bent on making it eleventh time lucky this time, something that is pissing off the parliamentarians.

Faking News can reveal from its trusted sources that the Group of Ministers working under Sharad Pawar has zeroed upon some “concrete steps” that could be taken to help the honorable parliament maintain its consistent performance on the anti-corruption bill.

“We could announce a PAC or JPC to look into the demands of these random guys,” a GoM member said to have proposed.

“Brilliant!” Sharad Pawar is reported to have reacted, “But what if they say pass this bill for Sachin Tendulkar? You know, people can go crazy and rally behind the bill in that case. Kapil Dev has already extended support to the bill. Fortunately, 1983 win is not such a big news now.”

“In that case, please note that the bill these guys have drafted doesn’t talk at all about any reservations to the dalits, OBC or the minorities, just like that Women’s Reservation Bill,” the member divulged the plan-b, “I guess we could introduce it in the parliament again, and some of our friends could stall the bill for being unfair to the weaker sections of the society.”

The Group of Ministers could soon submit its report to the Prime Minister’s Office.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/anna_hazare-187x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-asks-anna-hazare-to-tolerate-corruption-at-least-till-ipl-1592,PM asks Anna Hazare to tolerate corruption at least till IPL,,1301993066.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After taunting him with “being a Prime Minister was his birthright” banter, Manmohan Singh has fired another salvo at the beleaguered BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, when he asked the 83-year-old veteran to become the caretaker Prime Minister of the nation while he watches the semi-final match between India and Pakistan at Mohali tomorrow. Though it appears mocking, Dr. Singh claimed that he was dead serious.

“Soniaji is also watching the match and so are Rahul and Priyanka,” Manmohan Singh explained, “Pranabda is busy with Bengal elections while Antony is finalizing his Kerala tour for campaigning. I asked Chidu, but he has still not finished the Economics book I had given him last week. There was a clear governance deficit impending due to the match.”

“I thought a lot and decided to give Advaniji a chance to live his most cherished dream. I also find him a better candidate than anyone else left around me,” the match-going Prime Minister said.

Commentators had always wondered if there was a hidden message when L K Advani used to show hand, the election symbol of Congress

If Advani accepts the offer, he would become the Prime Minister of India for around nine hours tomorrow starting at 2 PM with the ‘toss’ till the visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani finishes the dessert of the dinner hosted for him.

“But he would just be a ‘caretaker’ PM, Dr. Singh has been shrewd not to make him an ‘acting’ PM for the duration,” pointed out constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap, “So he can’t take any policy level decisions, even if he wants to.”

“But anyway, there is hardly much of a difference between Congress and BJP policies,” he added as an afterthought.

Meanwhile the decision of Manmohan Singh has shocked the political circles in Delhi.

“I am not sure if Soniaji was consulted before this decision,” Delhi CM Sheila Dixit said, reiterating her support and loyalty to the “family” amidst allegation of corruption against her government during the Commonwealth Games.

Similar sentiments were echoed by many others in the Congress party, who thought Dr. Singh should have at least given the caretaking charge to some Congress leader. “My phone lines are always open, he should have at least called me to check if I was free,” said Digvijay Singh.

BJP leaders too appeared shocked with most of their leaders refusing to comment, though most of them claimed off the record that Manmohan Singh’s offer was solely aimed at embarrassing his party and its leader. Advani was not reachable for comments.

“What I don’t understand is that why do we need a government at all during the match? Who would be working anyway?” commented Atul, an Indian cricket fan, currently recovering from viral fever in his company’s HR documents.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lk-advani-250x208.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-asks-advani-to-be-caretaker-pm-during-mohali-match-1580,Manmohan Singh asks Advani to be caretaker PM during Mohali match,,1301383263.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A group of “fake pilots”, arrested by authorities in the past few days, have offered free laptops and other benefits to passengers, especially those hailing from Tamil Nadu, in exchange for “legitimacy” of their professional status. In fact, passengers from Tamil Nadu have been promised a whole moth of free air-travel if they pressurize the government into stopping the crackdown on the “community” of fake pilots.

“We will provide free laptops with TV tuner cards to watch cricket matches if their free color TVs have started malfunctioning,” promised Prem Pushpak, a self-styled leader of the fake pilots, “Not only laptops, we can give rice at one rupees per kg, onions free of cost, mixer, grinder, ceiling fans, mangalsutra, Benarasi saari, Amul Macho underwear, anything they want; you name it, we have it with us – and you get all of them free!”

Many political parties in Tamil Nadu have promised free laptops if people vote them to power. Unconfirmed sources say that the laptop above had non-removable pre-installed wallpaper.

In exchange for all these freebies, the fake pilots have asked the common people to help them with their “struggle” against the police and regulatory authorities, who have been arresting them and others, who helped them get the fake flying licenses.

“The common citizens have to come together just once and sign a petition asking the government to grant us legitimacy,” Prem Pushpak explained, “We should be allowed to fly planes and serve the citizens, which is the sole purpose of our lives. We appeal to people in Tamil Nadu to take lead.”

When Faking News asked why he was making an appeal to the people of Tamil Nadu among all in the country, Prem said, “Tamil Nadu folks seem to be the most considerate when it comes to such cases. If people can give legitimacy to a people running government in exchange for free laptops, they might as well do that for people running planes.”

“And yeah, governments have crashed earlier, but mind you, no fake pilot ever crashed any plane,” he argued.

Prem Pushpak is confident that his appeal would be given a favorable response by the people. “But this is no bribe or trading; we are genuinely interested in serving people by flying them from one destination to another,” Prem reiterated.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dmk_laptop.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fake-pilots-offer-free-laptops-to-passengers-from-tamil-nadu-to-win-legitimacy-1572,Fake pilots offer free laptops to passengers from Tamil Nadu to win legitimacy,,1301137240.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-exchanging-couplets-manmohan-sushma-to-play-badminton-1567,"New Delhi. A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and leader of opposition Sushma Swaraj traded couplets in the parliament during a discussion on trading of MPs, both the leaders have now decided to play badminton with each other so that the citizens of India get all their answer about corruption in public life. The badminton match would be played after cricket fever is gone from the country.

“We are answerable to the citizens of India and we’d do everything to assure them that parliamentary system was working,” a rare joint statement from the government and opposition read. The statement further assured the citizens that the Prime Minister and the leader of opposition will tackle the issue of corruption on a badminton court soon.

Cash-for-votes scam has always brought out the cheerful best in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He was seen giving a ‘thumbs up’ ahead of the tainted vote in July 2008, then he recited a couplet a couple of days back, and now he is all set to play badminton over the issue.

“Right now people are busy with cricket and looking forward to the India-Pakistan semi-final,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who read out the joint statement, said, “Also, IPL starts thereafter, therefore acting in public interest, we could schedule the badminton match at an appropriate time.”

When Faking News asked how a badminton match could answer citizens’ concerns on corruption, Mr. Bansal read out a couplet, thus completing the trilogy of couplets on the issue of corruption.

“Tu bas khel dekh aur lutf uthaa, chal muskura, chal muskura,” Mr. Bansal said, which literally meant – you just witness the game and enjoy it, go ahead, start smiling – drawing huge appreciations from the mediapersons present, all of whom smiled and said “waah waah”.

Main opposition party BJP too has confirmed that it was ready for the match and saw it as an important step towards eliminating corruption from public life.

“Prime Minister’s offer to play badminton is charming,” Sushma Swaraj conceded, “I am now looking for a badminton racket. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has offered me to give a few unused ones from the Commonwealth Games storeroom, but we would use our own.”

The news of the impending badminton match has been largely received positively by everyone, except a few cynics who thought a tennis match would have been a better choice.

“Pushing the ball in each other’s court would have solved the problem forever,” said Sameer Hindustani, a cynic.

“This is a good choice; at least people who started following me after being pissed off with Sania Mirza would finally understand the difference between tennis and badminton,” Saina Nehwal welcomed the idea, though declined to comment over its effectiveness in checking corruption.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/manmohan_thumbs_up-250x212.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-exchanging-couplets-manmohan-sushma-to-play-badminton-1567,"After exchanging couplets, Manmohan-Sushma to play badminton",,1301061021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-leader-showed-penis-to-us-envoy-to-prove-government-was-potent-1545,"New Delhi. Latest WikiLeaks cables reveal that an unidentified Congress leader had shown his penis to an employee in US embassy to prove that the UPA government was potent and committed to the Indo-US nuclear deal. The incident happened just five days before the Manmohan Singh government was forced to face a vote of confidence in July 2008 after its leftist allies walked out of the coalition government.

In a cable dated July 17, 2008 sent to the US State Department by the US embassy in Delhi, US Charge d’Affaires Steven White writes about how his deputy was reassured about “potency” of the UPA-I government without the Left Front.

UPA government could prove its potency in the parliament on 22nd July 2008

The unnamed consulate deputy was visiting an unidentified and unnamed Congress leader.

“The leader reassured us that the UPA coalition had not lost any balls with their communist allies withdrawing support to the government,” the cable noted, “In fact he told us that the government had always felt constipated with communist parties in their lap, and their exit had made them feel free and fresh ‘down there’. UPA was ready to hump and roam around like a raging bull.”

In case the US envoy doesn’t find it just an empty boast, the unnamed Congress leader is reported to have shown “two inches of his toolbox” to the visiting envoy and claimed that the party and the government had many others “similar tools”, which it would use to prove its potency in the parliament.

Although the cable doesn’t explicitly mentions it, experts believe that “toolbox” clearly was an euphemism or slang for penis i.e. male reproductive organ, which the mysterious Congress leader showed to the US embassy staff to prove a point.

Expectedly, the revelations have heated up the political atmosphere with the main opposition party BJP deciding to raise the issue in the parliament, whereas other commentators have found the act of Congress leader “silly”.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-says-it-was-error-of-judgment-to-become-pm-1521,"New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that it was an “error of judgment” on his part to have agreed to become the Prime Minister of the country some seven years ago.

“I was doing just fine being a Rajya Sabha MP,” Dr. Singh said in a candid interview with Faking News, “I had many private bills in mind to improve the economy of our country but then I was asked to head the government.”

Manmohan Singh gestures during the interview

Dr. Singh said that initially he was pretty excited about the new role even as a Congress leader (Ganga Charan Rajput, now in BSP) threatened to commit suicide over Sonia Gandhi choosing not to become the Prime Minister herself. But less than a week in office, the former economist and RBI governor started facing problems.

“I was given a list of names who would be ministers in my cabinet,” Dr. Singh recalled, “I thought it was a raw data and I used a utility function to find out who among those qualified to become ministers. I got a pretty much flat curve on the graph, almost touching the x-axis where the names were plotted, with a few exceptions. But soon I realized that the exercise was not needed as that was a final list.”

“It sucked!” he added.

He recollected how the same frustratingly painful exercise was repeated in 2009 when UPA won the general elections.

“A Raja’s utility output fell in the fourth quadrant in my graph this time,” Dr. Singh showed us a crumpled piece of paper where he had drawn his utility function graph again in May 2009, “Fourth quadrant means negative output you know. Yes, agreed that it’s a notional value, but being an economist, I knew that notional values had real implications.”

With no takers for his utility function and graphs that he drew, an annoyed Manmohan Singh decided to “chuck it all” and let the government run as it has been being run since independence.

“I didn’t give two hoots to the appointment of CVC next time; I drew no graphs,” Dr. Singh said.

But the Prime Minister reiterated that despite such hardships, he never thought of quitting.

Talking exclusively to Faking News editor once the press meet with sundry editors was over, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh candidly admitted that he did feel like giving a tight slap to A Raja and some of his other colleagues in the party and the cabinet for their errant ways.

“Totally,” was how the PM responded when Faking News editor Pagal Patrakar asked if he ever felt like slapping A Raja for bringing bad name to his government?

“One tight slap,” he stressed.

Prime Minister speaking to journalists earlier in the day, where he broke his silence on corruption without saying much

Mr. Singh conceded that he always had this sinking feeling that something was not right in the way 2G spectrum was being allotted, but he decided not to intervene.

“If I had intervened, they would have got some people to intervene in my job,” the head of the union council of ministers said, but declined to take any names.

“I won’t lie to you, I did feel like quitting,” Prime Minister suddenly erupted, “But then I thought, who after me in the UPA? People like Arun Shourie have been hinting at Pranab Mukherjee. See, even I was a good Finance Minister. Furthermore, you haven’t seen the Swiss Bank list, I’ve seen it.”

Talking about his earlier meeting with the editors of various news organizations, Prime Minister expressed happiness and satisfaction that it went well.

Faking News can confirm from its PMO sources that at least one senior editor had plans to become Prime Minister for a day a la Anil Kapoor in the movie Nayak by grilling and heckling Mr. Singh. Unconfirmed sources suggest that it was Times Now’s Arnab Goswami, though Mr. Singh denied it himself.

“He didn’t interrupt me in my job,” PM said, “In fact, all the editors were courteous.”

“The hardest hitting question was when Anuradha Prasad asked me to name my favorite cricketer,” Manmohan Singh recalled, “I didn’t answer as I didn’t want to pressurize Dhoni with my choices. He should select a team of his favorites.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-sues-mayawati-for-copyright-violation-over-sycophancy-1467,"New Delhi. Congress has strongly objected to the incident of a retired police officer wiping mud off Mayawati’s shoes as she talked to others, claiming that such sycophancy didn’t suit non-Congress parties and leaders. The grand old political party has further served a legal notice on the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister accusing her of rampantly copying Congress’ policies and culture without any due credit or compensation.

“First she started building random monuments and parks named after public figures, then she wore garland of money, and now this,” Congress spokesman and lawyer Manish Tewari said, “This is a clear case of copying us blatantly.”

A Congress leader’s tribute to Sonia Gandhi

Tewari claimed that the act of wiping the mud off Mayawati’s shoes was inspired by the “achievement” of Maharashtra minister and Congress leader Ramesh Bagwe, who carried chappals (slippers) of Rahul Gandhi almost exactly a year back.

“What next? Will Mayawati drive a bicycle on Lucknow roads in track suits?” wondered Mr. Tewari.

Apart from serving a legal notice and seeking a compensation of 1.5 lakhs life-size Mayawati statues made in gold, Congress has also decided to protest against this public show of sycophancy by BSP friendly elements by organizing state wide rallies, where party workers will wipe the dust off all the hoardings and posters of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in the state.

Meanwhile BSP is unfazed with both the criticism as well as the legal notice. Party sources inform that the workers have already averred to double their levels of sycophancy and even make a show out of it, as they had done last time by presenting a second garland made of money to Mayawati when the first one was criticized.

“Of course we can’t ask Behenji to walk in mud again,” said a BSP strategist, “We are in talks with Imagine TV to host a celebrity special show of ‘Zor Ka Jhatka – Total Wipeout’ where Behenji might fall in one of those mud-pools. The moment that happens, every party worker would assemble and start wiping off the mud.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonia-as-laxmibai-250x204.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-sues-mayawati-for-copyright-violation-over-sycophancy-1467,Congress sues Mayawati for copyright violation over sycophancy,,1297161963.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/a-raja-consulting-experts-to-find-out-the-right-time-to-fall-ill-1450,"New Delhi. Former telecom minister and DMK’s propaganda secretary A Raja is consulting a team of experts to find an appropriate time when he could fall ill and get shifted to a cozy hospital from the current CBI custody. CBI had arrested A Raja and two of his colleagues yesterday in connection with the 2G scam, which never took place according to the new telecom minister Kapil Sibal.

Raja and his colleagues were sent into a five day remand of CBI by the Patiala House court earlier today, which led Raja to plan meticulously for his ill being. According to sources, a team of lawyers, doctors, and astrologers have been summoned to the DMK office in Chennai, where calculations are going on in full swing to find the “right way” for Raja to get ill.

A Raja is seen a little distressed here when he was produced in a court; he could fall ill soon

“It should look natural, even though there have been a trend of politicians falling ill when arrested,” said Dr. Illhuaraja, who is leading the scientific research team to help the former honorable cabinet minister out of his miseries.

DMK chief Dr. Karunanidhi, who is not a medical doctor otherwise, too was seen concerned and busy as he googled for “major causes of heart attack”. Other doctors reportedly asked the party head to “go easy” and relax while they analyzed the medical history of A Raja to come up with a plausible excuse.

Although a rationalist party, DMK sources indicate that even a team of astrologers are working overtime to find a good muhurat (auspicious time) when Raja could suddenly complain of a chest pain, stomachache, high blood pressure, or something random in the next few days.

“Two grams of gold dust in a small black bag full of vibhuti (holy ash) has already been delivered to Mr. Raja,” informed Swami Swanitechanand, who confirmed that 2-Grams of gold referred to the 2G episode and was expected to shield Raja.

“Kalaignar doesn’t want to take any risk,” a DMK sources said, “He even tried calling Niira Radia, but her phone was switched off.”

The team of experts is expected to conclude their research and submit their report to Dr. Karunanidhi by tomorrow morning, after which A Raja would be advised by the party chief to take “appropriate” steps.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/A_Raja-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/a-raja-consulting-experts-to-find-out-the-right-time-to-fall-ill-1450,A Raja consulting experts to find out the right time to fall ill,,1296734417.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-article-on-corruption-published-in-champak-magazine-1610,"New Delhi. In a major embarrassment to the Congress party, an article written by its General Secretary Rahul Gandhi has been published by once popular children’s magazine Champak. The article deals with the currently hot topic of corruption in public life and it shows how a young lion named “Leo Baby” removed corruption from the jungle for good.

Sources tell Faking News that Rahul Gandhi had written the article last week after Anna Hazare started his fast against corruption and it was due to be published in the party newsletter, but somehow it got leaked to the publishers of Champak.

Future generations of India would now get to learn about corruption at a young age

“It’s a conspiracy to deride Rahul Baba,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh alleged, “The publishers of that magazine have clear leftist leanings and they know their favorite parties are going to lose in Kerala and Bengal, that’s why they have stooped to such cheap tactics.”

Digvijay Singh suspected the hand of communist leaders behind this “conspiracy” as the name “Leo Baby” sounded very similar to “Amul Baby”, a sobriquet given to Rahul Gandhi by veteran communist leader VS Achuthanandan.

“This article is not written at all by Rahul Baba,” Digvijay Singh further claimed, “The publishers have written it themselves and are trying to push up the sales of their magazine. My lawyer could call me anytime and soon I’d file a case against them.”

Digvijay Singh refused to comment over the possibility of the government banning Champak in a few states.

However the publishers of the magazine, Delhi Press, have claimed that the article was indeed written by Rahul Gandhi and it was delivered to their office in an official Congress envelop with the postage stamp paid by the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office).

“The article also talks of two jungles, aam jaanwar (common animals), and a deer called Hiranavati; so it totally looks authentic to us,” an official of Delhi Press told our reporter Chatur Chintu.

Interestingly, the Delhi Press official unwittingly conceded that the PMO envelop didn’t have any covering letter directing them to publish the article specifically in Champak among the 30-odd magazines that the group operates, but the editors took this decision.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-pawar-wants-benefit-of-doubt-in-all-cases-of-corruption-1604,"New Delhi. Taking a cue from the game of cricket where benefit of doubt is given to the batsmen, Sharad Pawar has suggested to the Lokpal bill drafting committee that benefit of doubt should be given to the politician in all cases of corruption. Pawar, who earlier resigned from the Group of Ministers formed to look into the finer aspects of the bill, wrote a letter to the media explaining his demand.

“There are allegations of corruption in each move a politician makes just like there are allegations of match-fixing in each cricket match that is played these days,” Pawar wrote in his letter, “And just like the batsman takes the center stage in a cricket match, a politician is at the center of every scam.”

Benefit of doubt is usually given to the batsmen

Based on this premise, the Agriculture Minister cum the ICC President has suggested that all the politicians should be given the benefit of doubt in all the cases of corruption. Under this “benefit” provision, it has been suggested that the proposed office of Lokpal should not initiate any proceedings or investigations against a politician if there was even a thread of doubt remaining in the corruption case.

Mr. Pawar claimed that many techniques of cricket were already being employed in cases of corruption and hence his demand was not very outlandish. He claimed that the CAG report on the 2G scam used a similar technique like the “Hawk-Eye” to assess the losses to the government exchequer.

“CAG calculated the revenue that the government could have generated had the path of competitive spectrum selling not been obstructed by A Raja. It’s very much similar to using Hawk-Eye to find out where the ball would have traveled had its path not been obstructed by the leg of the batsman,” Pawar claimed.

In his letter, Pawar didn’t comment over the findings revealed by either Hawk-Eye or the CAG, even as the latter was termed as “notional” by his colleague Kapil Sibal earlier; something that has given rise to fears that all LBW decisions going in favor of bowlers through UDRS could become doubtful if Sibal became the Sports Minister in the next cabinet reshuffle.

Meanwhile Sharad Pawar reported a mail from Faking News as “spam” after we asked him if Shahid Balwa was a substitute player or a runner for an injured batsman in his opinion.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/hawk-eye-250x185.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sharad-pawar-wants-benefit-of-doubt-in-all-cases-of-corruption-1604,Sharad Pawar wants benefit of doubt in all cases of corruption,,1302863288.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-bought-things-at-inflated-prices-to-fight-war-against-corruption-1598,"New Delhi. In a shocking development, it has come to light that the government has bought an assortment of unnecessary things, ranging from war-tanks to beer-mugs, at inflated and unbelievable prices in name of fighting “war against corruption”. These things were bought in the last three days after social activist and Gandhian leader Anna Hazare started his fast unto death to protest corruption in civil life.

“WTF! Another scam!?” reacted Vivek, an anti-corruption activist, who had just returned from Jantar Mantar in Delhi where Hazare has been fasting.

Vivek’s fears are not unfounded as it surely looks like another scam with the government signing an order to buy a fleet of war-tanks from the US to fight war against corruption. Even as using tanks to fight such kind of a war looked as odd as it can get, Faking News was further shocked to learn that the tanks were sold to India at seven times higher rate than what US charges other countries, except Pakistan, where they are given free in aid.

Earlier in July 2010, Jyoti Devi, a Congress leader in Bihar assembly, had valiantly fought the war against corruption with flower pots.

Faking News’ frenetic attempts to contact defense ministry, which included two emails to contact@mod.nic.in and a missed call to the landline number given on the website, were returned with no success even as we further discovered that other departments too had indulged in similar deals to buy bizarre things in name of fighting corruption.

For example, at least 3000 beer mugs of 50,000 rupees each were bought by the Home Ministry to fight corruption, though the official there claimed that the mugs were bought so that juice could be offered in them to the fasting protestors at Jantar Mantar.

“Those are the normal rates we pay for buying housekeeping objects,” said the official, rejecting any malpractice or fraud in the purchase of the beer-mugs.

Similar outlandish things at puzzling prices were bought by various other government ministries, with the most bizarre being Kapil Sibal’s Telecommunications Ministry buying zoozoos to win the war against the corruption. Vodafone, which otherwise owes $ 2.5 billion to the government as unpaid taxes, would now be paid $ 3 billion by the government for handing over an “army” of 300 3G zoozoos.

Faking News didn’t bother to check what the Agriculture Ministry under Sharad Pawar was upto.

Social activist Anna Hazare, who for some inscrutable reason started talking about corruption and some funny sounding Jan Lokpal Bill between celebrations of world cup victory and build up to the IPL, has been asked by the Prime Minister to wait until after the IPL was over. Anna Hazare had earlier announced a fast unto death if the Parliament didn’t adopt the anti-corruption bill without diluting it.

“At least wait till the IPL was over gaddamnit!” a press statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) read, claiming to reflect the mood of the nation, duly represented by the parliamentarians.

“The country is happy, let them be, will you?” the statement further appealed to the 72-year-old activist, who deems corruption as the biggest threat to the Indian democracy.

Government is clueless why this man wants to eradicate corruption from the public life in India

Hazare, a Gandhian, wants the state and central government to set up offices of ombudsmen, independent of government control like the Election Commission, where common citizens can walk in without fear and register complaint against elected representatives and public servants for cases of corruption. The ombudsman will also have the power to prosecute those found guilty without waiting for government’s permission.

“That’s ridiculous,” said a minister on conditions of anonymity reacting to the provisions of the Jan Lokpal bill that is being supported by people like Kiran Bedi, RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal, and Baba Ramdev.

Due to its highly ridiculous nature, the government wants a Group of Ministers (GoM), under the able leadership of Sharad Pawar, to review the bill and “set it straight”.

The Jan Lokpal bill has been pending adoption by the parliament since it was first introduced in 1969 and was erroneously passed by the Lok Sabha, but failed to get pass the Rajya Sabha. The bill failed to pass on nine subsequent occasions after being mysteriously introduced in the parliament ever since, making it the longest pending bill, ahead of the Women’s Reservation Bill.

But Anna Hazare is hell bent on making it eleventh time lucky this time, something that is pissing off the parliamentarians.

Faking News can reveal from its trusted sources that the Group of Ministers working under Sharad Pawar has zeroed upon some “concrete steps” that could be taken to help the honorable parliament maintain its consistent performance on the anti-corruption bill.

“We could announce a PAC or JPC to look into the demands of these random guys,” a GoM member said to have proposed.

“Brilliant!” Sharad Pawar is reported to have reacted, “But what if they say pass this bill for Sachin Tendulkar? You know, people can go crazy and rally behind the bill in that case. Kapil Dev has already extended support to the bill. Fortunately, 1983 win is not such a big news now.”

“In that case, please note that the bill these guys have drafted doesn’t talk at all about any reservations to the dalits, OBC or the minorities, just like that Women’s Reservation Bill,” the member divulged the plan-b, “I guess we could introduce it in the parliament again, and some of our friends could stall the bill for being unfair to the weaker sections of the society.”

The Group of Ministers could soon submit its report to the Prime Minister’s Office.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/anna_hazare-187x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/pm-asks-anna-hazare-to-tolerate-corruption-at-least-till-ipl-1592,PM asks Anna Hazare to tolerate corruption at least till IPL,,1301993066.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After taunting him with “being a Prime Minister was his birthright” banter, Manmohan Singh has fired another salvo at the beleaguered BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, when he asked the 83-year-old veteran to become the caretaker Prime Minister of the nation while he watches the semi-final match between India and Pakistan at Mohali tomorrow. Though it appears mocking, Dr. Singh claimed that he was dead serious.

“Soniaji is also watching the match and so are Rahul and Priyanka,” Manmohan Singh explained, “Pranabda is busy with Bengal elections while Antony is finalizing his Kerala tour for campaigning. I asked Chidu, but he has still not finished the Economics book I had given him last week. There was a clear governance deficit impending due to the match.”

“I thought a lot and decided to give Advaniji a chance to live his most cherished dream. I also find him a better candidate than anyone else left around me,” the match-going Prime Minister said.

Commentators had always wondered if there was a hidden message when L K Advani used to show hand, the election symbol of Congress

If Advani accepts the offer, he would become the Prime Minister of India for around nine hours tomorrow starting at 2 PM with the ‘toss’ till the visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani finishes the dessert of the dinner hosted for him.

“But he would just be a ‘caretaker’ PM, Dr. Singh has been shrewd not to make him an ‘acting’ PM for the duration,” pointed out constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap, “So he can’t take any policy level decisions, even if he wants to.”

“But anyway, there is hardly much of a difference between Congress and BJP policies,” he added as an afterthought.

Meanwhile the decision of Manmohan Singh has shocked the political circles in Delhi.

“I am not sure if Soniaji was consulted before this decision,” Delhi CM Sheila Dixit said, reiterating her support and loyalty to the “family” amidst allegation of corruption against her government during the Commonwealth Games.

Similar sentiments were echoed by many others in the Congress party, who thought Dr. Singh should have at least given the caretaking charge to some Congress leader. “My phone lines are always open, he should have at least called me to check if I was free,” said Digvijay Singh.

BJP leaders too appeared shocked with most of their leaders refusing to comment, though most of them claimed off the record that Manmohan Singh’s offer was solely aimed at embarrassing his party and its leader. Advani was not reachable for comments.

“What I don’t understand is that why do we need a government at all during the match?

A group of “fake pilots”, arrested by authorities in the past few days, have offered free laptops and other benefits to passengers, especially those hailing from Tamil Nadu, in exchange for “legitimacy” of their professional status. In fact, passengers from Tamil Nadu have been promised a whole moth of free air-travel if they pressurize the government into stopping the crackdown on the “community” of fake pilots.

“We will provide free laptops with TV tuner cards to watch cricket matches if their free color TVs have started malfunctioning,” promised Prem Pushpak, a self-styled leader of the fake pilots, “Not only laptops, we can give rice at one rupees per kg, onions free of cost, mixer, grinder, ceiling fans, mangalsutra, Benarasi saari, Amul Macho underwear, anything they want; you name it, we have it with us – and you get all of them free!”

Many political parties in Tamil Nadu have promised free laptops if people vote them to power. Unconfirmed sources say that the laptop above had non-removable pre-installed wallpaper.

In exchange for all these freebies, the fake pilots have asked the common people to help them with their “struggle” against the police and regulatory authorities, who have been arresting them and others, who helped them get the fake flying licenses.

“The common citizens have to come together just once and sign a petition asking the government to grant us legitimacy,” Prem Pushpak explained, “We should be allowed to fly planes and serve the citizens, which is the sole purpose of our lives. We appeal to people in Tamil Nadu to take lead.”

When Faking News asked why he was making an appeal to the people of Tamil Nadu among all in the country, Prem said, “Tamil Nadu folks seem to be the most considerate when it comes to such cases. If people can give legitimacy to a people running government in exchange for free laptops, they might as well do that for people running planes.”

“And yeah, governments have crashed earlier, but mind you, no fake pilot ever crashed any plane,” he argued.

Prem Pushpak is confident that his appeal would be given a favorable response by the people. “But this is no bribe or trading; we are genuinely interested in serving people by flying them from one destination to another,” Prem reiterated.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dmk_laptop.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fake-pilots-offer-free-laptops-to-passengers-from-tamil-nadu-to-win-legitimacy-1572,Fake pilots offer free laptops to passengers from Tamil Nadu to win legitimacy,,1301137240.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-exchanging-couplets-manmohan-sushma-to-play-badminton-1567,"New Delhi. A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and leader of opposition Sushma Swaraj traded couplets in the parliament during a discussion on trading of MPs, both the leaders have now decided to play badminton with each other so that the citizens of India get all their answer about corruption in public life. The badminton match would be played after cricket fever is gone from the country.

“We are answerable to the citizens of India and we’d do everything to assure them that parliamentary system was working,” a rare joint statement from the government and opposition read. The statement further assured the citizens that the Prime Minister and the leader of opposition will tackle the issue of corruption on a badminton court soon.

Cash-for-votes scam has always brought out the cheerful best in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He was seen giving a ‘thumbs up’ ahead of the tainted vote in July 2008, then he recited a couplet a couple of days back, and now he is all set to play badminton over the issue.

“Right now people are busy with cricket and looking forward to the India-Pakistan semi-final,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who read out the joint statement, said, “Also, IPL starts thereafter, therefore acting in public interest, we could schedule the badminton match at an appropriate time.”

When Faking News asked how a badminton match could answer citizens’ concerns on corruption, Mr. Bansal read out a couplet, thus completing the trilogy of couplets on the issue of corruption.

“Tu bas khel dekh aur lutf uthaa, chal muskura, chal muskura,” Mr. Bansal said, which literally meant – you just witness the game and enjoy it, go ahead, start smiling – drawing huge appreciations from the mediapersons present, all of whom smiled and said “waah waah”.

Main opposition party BJP too has confirmed that it was ready for the match and saw it as an important step towards eliminating corruption from public life.

“Prime Minister’s offer to play badminton is charming,” Sushma Swaraj conceded, “I am now looking for a badminton racket. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has offered me to give a few unused ones from the Commonwealth Games storeroom, but we would use our own.”

The news of the impending badminton match has been largely received positively by everyone, except a few cynics who thought a tennis match would have been a better choice.

“Pushing the ball in each other’s court would have solved the problem forever,” said Sameer Hindustani, a cynic.

“This is a good choice; at least people who started following me after being pissed off with Sania Mirza would finally understand the difference between tennis and badminton,” Saina Nehwal welcomed the idea, though declined to comment over its effectiveness in checking corruption.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/manmohan_thumbs_up-250x212.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-exchanging-couplets-manmohan-sushma-to-play-badminton-1567,"After exchanging couplets, Manmohan-Sushma to play badminton",,1301061021.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Latest WikiLeaks cables reveal that an unidentified Congress leader had shown his penis to an employee in US embassy to prove that the UPA government was potent and committed to the Indo-US nuclear deal. The incident happened just five days before the Manmohan Singh government was forced to face a vote of confidence in July 2008 after its leftist allies walked out of the coalition government.

In a cable dated July 17, 2008 sent to the US State Department by the US embassy in Delhi, US Charge d’Affaires Steven White writes about how his deputy was reassured about “potency” of the UPA-I government without the Left Front.

UPA government could prove its potency in the parliament on 22nd July 2008

The unnamed consulate deputy was visiting an unidentified and unnamed Congress leader.

“The leader reassured us that the UPA coalition had not lost any balls with their communist allies withdrawing support to the government,” the cable noted, “In fact he told us that the government had always felt constipated with communist parties in their lap, and their exit had made them feel free and fresh ‘down there’. UPA was ready to hump and roam around like a raging bull.”

In case the US envoy doesn’t find it just an empty boast, the unnamed Congress leader is reported to have shown “two inches of his toolbox” to the visiting envoy and claimed that the party and the government had many others “similar tools”, which it would use to prove its potency in the parliament.

Although the cable doesn’t explicitly mentions it, experts believe that “toolbox” clearly was an euphemism or slang for penis i.e. male reproductive organ, which the mysterious Congress leader showed to the US embassy staff to prove a point.

Expectedly, the revelations have heated up the political atmosphere with the main opposition party BJP deciding to raise the issue in the parliament, whereas other commentators have found the act of Congress leader “silly”.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-says-it-was-error-of-judgment-to-become-pm-1521,"New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that it was an “error of judgment” on his part to have agreed to become the Prime Minister of the country some seven years ago.

“I was doing just fine being a Rajya Sabha MP,” Dr. Singh said in a candid interview with Faking News, “I had many private bills in mind to improve the economy of our country but then I was asked to head the government.”

Manmohan Singh gestures during the interview

Dr. Singh said that initially he was pretty excited about the new role even as a Congress leader (Ganga Charan Rajput, now in BSP) threatened to commit suicide over Sonia Gandhi choosing not to become the Prime Minister herself. But less than a week in office, the former economist and RBI governor started facing problems.

“I was given a list of names who would be ministers in my cabinet,” Dr. Singh recalled, “I thought it was a raw data and I used a utility function to find out who among those qualified to become ministers. I got a pretty much flat curve on the graph, almost touching the x-axis where the names were plotted, with a few exceptions. But soon I realized that the exercise was not needed as that was a final list.”

“It sucked!” he added.

He recollected how the same frustratingly painful exercise was repeated in 2009 when UPA won the general elections.

“A Raja’s utility output fell in the fourth quadrant in my graph this time,” Dr. Singh showed us a crumpled piece of paper where he had drawn his utility function graph again in May 2009, “Fourth quadrant means negative output you know. Yes, agreed that it’s a notional value, but being an economist, I knew that notional values had real implications.”

With no takers for his utility function and graphs that he drew, an annoyed Manmohan Singh decided to “chuck it all” and let the government run as it has been being run since independence.

“I didn’t give two hoots to the appointment of CVC next time; I drew no graphs,” Dr. Singh said.

But the Prime Minister reiterated that despite such hardships, he never thought of quitting.

Talking exclusively to Faking News editor once the press meet with sundry editors was over, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh candidly admitted that he did feel like giving a tight slap to A Raja and some of his other colleagues in the party and the cabinet for their errant ways.

“Totally,” was how the PM responded when Faking News editor Pagal Patrakar asked if he ever felt like slapping A Raja for bringing bad name to his government?

“One tight slap,” he stressed.

Prime Minister speaking to journalists earlier in the day, where he broke his silence on corruption without saying much

Mr. Singh conceded that he always had this sinking feeling that something was not right in the way 2G spectrum was being allotted, but he decided not to intervene.

“If I had intervened, they would have got some people to intervene in my job,” the head of the union council of ministers said, but declined to take any names.

“I won’t lie to you, I did feel like quitting,” Prime Minister suddenly erupted, “But then I thought, who after me in the UPA? People like Arun Shourie have been hinting at Pranab Mukherjee. See, even I was a good Finance Minister. Furthermore, you haven’t seen the Swiss Bank list, I’ve seen it.”

Talking about his earlier meeting with the editors of various news organizations, Prime Minister expressed happiness and satisfaction that it went well.

Faking News can confirm from its PMO sources that at least one senior editor had plans to become Prime Minister for a day a la Anil Kapoor in the movie Nayak by grilling and heckling Mr. Singh. Unconfirmed sources suggest that it was Times Now’s Arnab Goswami, though Mr. Singh denied it himself.

“He didn’t interrupt me in my job,” PM said, “In fact, all the editors were courteous.”

“The hardest hitting question was when Anuradha Prasad asked me to name my favorite cricketer,” Manmohan Singh recalled, “I didn’t answer as I didn’t want to pressurize Dhoni with my choices. He should select a team of his favorites.”

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-sues-mayawati-for-copyright-violation-over-sycophancy-1467,"New Delhi. Congress has strongly objected to the incident of a retired police officer wiping mud off Mayawati’s shoes as she talked to others, claiming that such sycophancy didn’t suit non-Congress parties and leaders. The grand old political party has further served a legal notice on the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister accusing her of rampantly copying Congress’ policies and culture without any due credit or compensation.

“First she started building random monuments and parks named after public figures, then she wore garland of money, and now this,” Congress spokesman and lawyer Manish Tewari said, “This is a clear case of copying us blatantly.”

A Congress leader’s tribute to Sonia Gandhi

Tewari claimed that the act of wiping the mud off Mayawati’s shoes was inspired by the “achievement” of Maharashtra minister and Congress leader Ramesh Bagwe, who carried chappals (slippers) of Rahul Gandhi almost exactly a year back.

“What next? Will Mayawati drive a bicycle on Lucknow roads in track suits?” wondered Mr. Tewari.

Apart from serving a legal notice and seeking a compensation of 1.5 lakhs life-size Mayawati statues made in gold, Congress has also decided to protest against this public show of sycophancy by BSP friendly elements by organizing state wide rallies, where party workers will wipe the dust off all the hoardings and posters of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in the state.

Meanwhile BSP is unfazed with both the criticism as well as the legal notice. Party sources inform that the workers have already averred to double their levels of sycophancy and even make a show out of it, as they had done last time by presenting a second garland made of money to Mayawati when the first one was criticized.

“Of course we can’t ask Behenji to walk in mud again,” said a BSP strategist, “We are in talks with Imagine TV to host a celebrity special show of ‘Zor Ka Jhatka – Total Wipeout’ where Behenji might fall in one of those mud-pools. The moment that happens, every party worker would assemble and start wiping off the mud.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonia-as-laxmibai-250x204.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-sues-mayawati-for-copyright-violation-over-sycophancy-1467,Congress sues Mayawati for copyright violation over sycophancy,,1297161963.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/a-raja-consulting-experts-to-find-out-the-right-time-to-fall-ill-1450,"New Delhi. Former telecom minister and DMK’s propaganda secretary A Raja is consulting a team of experts to find an appropriate time when he could fall ill and get shifted to a cozy hospital from the current CBI custody. CBI had arrested A Raja and two of his colleagues yesterday in connection with the 2G scam, which never took place according to the new telecom minister Kapil Sibal.

Raja and his colleagues were sent into a five day remand of CBI by the Patiala House court earlier today, which led Raja to plan meticulously for his ill being. According to sources, a team of lawyers, doctors, and astrologers have been summoned to the DMK office in Chennai, where calculations are going on in full swing to find the “right way” for Raja to get ill.

A Raja is seen a little distressed here when he was produced in a court; he could fall ill soon

“It should look natural, even though there have been a trend of politicians falling ill when arrested,” said Dr. Illhuaraja, who is leading the scientific research team to help the former honorable cabinet minister out of his miseries.

DMK chief Dr. Karunanidhi, who is not a medical doctor otherwise, too was seen concerned and busy as he googled for “major causes of heart attack”. Other doctors reportedly asked the party head to “go easy” and relax while they analyzed the medical history of A Raja to come up with a plausible excuse.

Although a rationalist party, DMK sources indicate that even a team of astrologers are working overtime to find a good muhurat (auspicious time) when Raja could suddenly complain of a chest pain, stomachache, high blood pressure, or something random in the next few days.

“Two grams of gold dust in a small black bag full of vibhuti (holy ash) has already been delivered to Mr. Raja,” informed Swami Swanitechanand, who confirmed that 2-Grams of gold referred to the 2G episode and was expected to shield Raja.

“Kalaignar doesn’t want to take any risk,” a DMK sources said, “He even tried calling Niira Radia, but her phone was switched off.”

The team of experts is expected to conclude their research and submit their report to Dr. Karunanidhi by tomorrow morning, after which A Raja would be advised by the party chief to take “appropriate” steps.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/A_Raja-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/a-raja-consulting-experts-to-find-out-the-right-time-to-fall-ill-1450,A Raja consulting experts to find out the right time to fall ill,,1296734417.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a first sign of open rebellion against Congress high command, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is reported to have handed over the list of new Cabinet Ministers to WikiLeaks. This list was provided to him by Sonia Gandhi yesterday and Manmohan Singh was expected to sign the papers and submit it in 10 Janpath by today afternoon, but instead he chose to send the list to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.

“Yes, I have received a list with some funny sounding names that also sound familiar,” Assange confirmed, talking exclusively to Faking News on Skype, “I don’t know, either I have read those names in newspapers or the Swiss Bank accounts list that was submitted to me a couple of days back.”

Sonia Gandhi had given the list to Manmohan Singh

Assange refused to divulge the names of those on the list, as he claimed that his editors would first verify the list for authenticity before making it public.

When pointed out by Faking News that the list would anyway become public in few hours after cabinet reshuffle in Delhi, Assange replied, “Big deal!”

“As if this list is going to change anything in India or the world; I’d rather concentrate on that Swiss Bank list,” he added.

Meanwhile back in India, Congress leaders have expressed shock and “disgust” at such a move by the Prime Minister, which was taken without consulting Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi.

Mani Shankar Aiyar, a staunch loyalist of the party and the “family”, questioned the “secularism” of Dr. Singh post such a move. Later he changed “secularism” to “patriotism” and “integrity” before finally settling for “protocol” after persistent cross questioning by Faking News.

But Congress sources indicate that the party may not take any disciplinary action against Dr. Singh yet as it could mean installing someone else as Prime Minister at a time when everything was appearing fucked-up in the country due to rising inflation and regular scams.

“It’d be disaster to have Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister at this time, while making someone else the PM now would mean Rahul Gandhi’s current RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation or Rule At Choice) status goes back to WL (Wait List) status,” an expert pointed out.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sonia_Gandhi_Manmohan_Singh.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-leaks-list-of-new-ministers-to-wikileaks-1420,Manmohan Singh leaks list of new Ministers to WikiLeaks,,1295418797.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-image-appears-mysteriously-on-wall-1412,"Lucknow. When Ram Charan Pandey, 39, woke up today morning, he felt as if Mayawati was smiling at him. Being a Congress worker, he rubbed his eyes in disbelief, only to find an image of the state CM drawn on his bedroom wall. Initially he thought it to be a prank by his children or relatives, but after sustained investigations he concluded that it was a miracle.

“There was no such image when I had gone to bed and I had locked the door of my bedroom from inside,” Ram Charan said as a large congregation of journalists and BSP workers built up at his home, “It’s a miracle! I feel blessed that Behenji chose me to give her darshan on her 55th birthday.”

The image of Mayawati on the bedroom wall of Ram Charan Pandey

Ram Charan denied any other reason behind the appearance of the image and declared his intentions of becoming a Mayawati devotee for the rest of his life. A local scientist, who tried to dispute Ram Charan’s claim and sought to apply some chemicals on the image, was taken into custody by UP Police to maintain law and order in the state.

Mayawati’s party has welcomed the development and has decided to include Ram Charan into its fold. A Mayawati statuette made of gold was gifted to Ram Charan by the local BSP leader as a small token of appreciation for his “achievements”.

“Other Congress workers should take lessons from Pandeyji and start following the true Madamji,” Amarendra Singh, the local BSP leader said. Amarendra also demanded that the house of Ram Charan Pandey be converted into a monument or “memorial”.

Meanwhile state Congress committee has ordered an enquiry into the incident and has suspended Ram Charan Pandey from the primary membership of the party for indulging in anti-party activities.

The high command is reportedly upset with its workers for not even having seen Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi in their dreams, let alone their images appearing on objects in their houses.

Other political reactions have started pouring in too. BJP has termed the whole event as “drama” and has predicted that next time Mayawati statues all over the state could start drinking full-cream milk simultaneously, while Samajwadi Party has vowed to demolish the wall once it gets back to power.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bedroom-wall-250x193.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-image-appears-mysteriously-on-wall-1412,Mayawati’s image appears mysteriously on wall of Congress worker’s house,,1295075069.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

When CAT 2010 results were announced today, everyone was looking into the list of toppers, but being a media organization with a difference, Faking News decided to look into the list of ‘bottomers’ and was shocked to see the name of Union HRD Minister Kapil Sibal there.

With just 1.76 percentile, Mr. Sibal was among the worst performers in the reputed entrance test for admission into some of the best business schools of India.

Initially we thought it was some other test taker with the same name, but after sustained investigations we found out that it indeed was Kapil Sibal, the union cabinet minister, who had taken the test last year when he was bored in his office and was not yet given the responsibility of telecom ministry.

Kapil Sibal showing his purportedly real CAT scorecard where he got over 99 percentile in all the sections

“Yes, I did take the test for timepass,” Mr. Sibal confirmed when asked by our correspondent about his poor performance in the test, “but the numbers that CAT has come up with are utterly erroneous. The actual percentile that I got is very different and the numbers quoted by CAT doesn’t prove anything.”

Mr. Sibal argued that since he uses GRE-level words and idioms like “erroneous” and “flogging a dead horse” so frequently, he couldn’t have got such a low score in the Verbal Ability section of CAT, while his data interpretation and quantitative abilities have already been demonstrated when he questioned the numbers quoted by CAG in the 2G scam.

“The figure of 1.76 percentile is completely absurd and erroneous,” Sibal reiterated.

The cabinet minister of two ministries refused to answer why in the first place he took the test at all, even for timepass. Also, he rejected the contention as “ridiculous” that by issuing such statements in public he was hurting the credibility of an institution like CAT.

CAT authorities i.e. some guys at IIMs, refused to comment over this latest “controversy” but some trusted sources inform that not just Kapil Sibal, but many other politicians too had taken CAT 2010. The motives remain unclear but the results have been surprising.

“A Raja had unofficially topped the results,” our source disclosed, “but we referred the case to the CBI, who strangely closed the investigations without coming to any conclusion.”

“Even though Digvijay Singh already has a copy of CAT scorecard that shows him getting over 99.3 percentile, we can’t find his scores in our records,” our source said, further informing that at least three other politicians failed to take the test even after applying for the same.

“Murli Manohar Joshi was stopped from taking the test by his party workers. We had to reject Rahul Gandhi’s application as he had wrongly indicated his category as ‘dalit’ in the application form, while Suresh Kalmadi reached the test center three hours late on all the days,” sources revealed.

“Do they (CAT authorities) use energy efficient servers?” environment minister Jairam Ramesh responded when asked to comment about the surprising CAT results.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/KapilSibal-250x181.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/after-cag-kapil-sibal-rejects-cat-2010-score-as-erroneous-1406,"After CAG, Kapil Sibal now rejects CAT figures as “erroneous”",,1294821084.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/reddy-and-raju-families-agree-on-dividing-andhra-into-three-states-1389,"Hyderabad. In a day of dramatic developments, the various Reddy and Raju families of Andhra Pradesh have reached a settlement and agreed on how to carve up the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh.

“This agreement is fair and will be binding on all political parties”, said Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy, announcing the conclusion of a day-long discussion that involved all 23 ruling families of Andhra Pradesh.

As per the details that have been announced thus far, the state will be divided into three states: Telangana, Rayalaseema, and Coastal Andhra Pradesh. Each state will have its own new capital city, and building the official buildings, roads, and metro systems for each city will require hundreds of billions of dollars of new contracts, which will be shared “fairly” amongst the 23 families.

For the first three years, each of the three main parties: Congress, TDP, and TRS will get to nominate one Chief Minister each, after which free and fair elections will be held in all three states. It is expected that all the city-building contracts would have been awarded by then. Jaganmohan Reddy also announced that he was dissolving his own recently formed political party. It is believed that in return, his companies will be given first choice of the new contracts to be awarded.

It was decided on purpose to keep the new map of Andhra Pradesh colorful to reflect the mood of the decision makers

Hyderabad will be carved out into a separate entity, which would become a multi-product SEZ owned by a consortium of Telugu Biddas (“sons of the soil”). The ownership of the consortium has not yet been announced, but it seems each of the 23 families would each be allocated 3% each, with a further 11% reserved for “political parties and party-members”.

20% would be offered to a global Private Equity fund or hedge fund, and bids are expected to be invited within three months. Amit Ambuja, Managing Director of hedge fund DE Claw, denied that he had been approached yet, but expressed keen interest in such a project.

While IT companies present in Hyderabad welcomed the development, saying that SEZ status would benefit them in their business, other companies were not quite so positive.

“If Hyderabad-based companies will only be allowed to export their services under the SEZ laws – what about the many businesses that serve customers from the rest of Andhra?” asked Mr. Tabrez Jalil, who runs a tractor dealership in Hyderabad targeting farmers from Telangana.

When this reporter addressed the same query to the Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma, he initially denied that any export rules would be relaxed for the proposed SEZ, but later denied his denial.

“The scale of construction and related developmental challenges facing the three new states is truly monumental, and we should all help them in this hour of need”, he said, before muttering that he could only speak after “consulting with the High Command” and leaving for an important meeting.

But some Maoist sympathizers and activists have reassured “worried” businessmen like Mr. Jalil to wait a little till they declare independence from India. “They can start exporting their goods to us, we are fair in our dealings,” declared a Maoist leader with his face covered with a red colored cloth.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/apmap-250x238.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/reddy-and-raju-families-agree-on-dividing-andhra-into-three-states-1389,Reddy and Raju families agree on dividing Andhra into three states,,1294299688.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-revises-its-zero-tolerance-for-corruption-to-sub-zero-levels-1387,"New Delhi. To counter BJP’s announcement of strengthening its campaign on corruption, Congress has decided to update its “zero tolerance” policy towards corruption to sub-zero levels. An official statement announcing the same would be released by party president Sonia Gandhi at an “appropriate” time, sources say. Congress had earlier announced the zero tolerance policy after scams like 2G, Adarsh Housing Society, and CWG hit the headlines last year.

“Now that the Bofors scam is back to haunt us with the Gandhi family itself being accused of stashing away billions of secret dollars in Swiss Bank, the party felt the need to announce a new policy against corruption,” a Congress source told Faking News.

Bofors tanks were also meant to be used in sub-zero temperatures in Kashmir

The Congress working committee is expected to meet tomorrow to decide how many degrees below zero the new tolerance level should be. A general consensus is emerging at nine degrees below zero, though Digvijay Singh is reported to be having different ideas once again.

“Well, Soniaji’s birthday falls on 9 December so I thought 9 would be a good number,” said a Congress leader who supported the new tolerance level for corruption to be at minus nine degrees.

With the national capital freezing in cold and some parts of north India experiencing sub-zero temperatures, some party strategists believe that a sub-zero level for corruption could go well with the mood of the nation and garner public support.

Interestingly, no leader was willing to confirm if the scale Congress was referring to for tolerance was being measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit or something else; for nine degrees below zero level on the Celsius scale still meant around 16 degrees above zero on the Fahrenheit scale.

Even if it was some other scale, there remains a widespread confusion on what exactly a sub-zero tolerance for corruption means in practice.

“It could mean suspending members on corruption charges even before the media, opposition, or the CBI questions them,” guessed a Congress member, who thought it was a fantastic idea as Congress would always have the upper hand in claiming to have acted against the corrupt.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bofors-250x186.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-revises-its-zero-tolerance-for-corruption-to-sub-zero-levels-1387,Congress revises its zero tolerance for corruption to sub-zero levels,,1294223737.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-wears-garland-made-of-onions-as-veg-prices-rise-1365,"Allahabad. UP Chief Minister, Mayawati appeared at a BSP rally here yesterday wearing the replacement for her controversial garland made of Rs.1000 notes. As market prices escalated to record levels, the BSP leader donned a new garland made of onions.

Food price inflation means that Rs.1000 notes are no longer as valuable, explained party spokesman, Rajendra Kumar. “People are just not as awestruck by big notes now,” he said, “they’re far more impressed by more contemporary displays of wealth, such as the appearing with more than one onion or tomato at a time.”

The garland, consisting of 1000 halved onions, successfully boosted Mayawati’s public image. So powerful was its impact that many in the front row seats at the rally wore their own smaller onion garlands in tribute. Many broke down in tears for the duration of the speech.

The garland itself weighed 20kg and had to be supported by two bodyguards, one of whom told Faking News he was just grateful that the price of kaddu (pumpkin) had stayed low. He also said that a third bodyguard had become fed up of supporting the garland and suggested that a “24 carrot” necklace would be a good alternative. He was sacked immediately and is being sought by police for insubordination.

With the price of onions rising daily, commentators have asked if the vegetables for the garland came from the public distribution system. However, UP officials stated that the state’s PDS has not had any onions since 1992 and that it hoped to receive the garland once the CM had finished with it. Convinced that not even the UP government could afford so many onions, Faking News began an investigation.

After putting the “word out on the street” that a new guy in town might be interested in buying some onions for “ceremonial purposes”, a “dealer” agreed to meet Faking News in an alleyway in Lucknow. “You want your investment to last,” said Ahmed, 24, revealing a string of onions underneath his coat, “you want to look wealthy, perhaps even a little richer than you really are, you need quality onions which will last.”

He led our correspondent to a dimly lit workshop deep in the old city. “This is my supplier,” he said, gesturing to 78-year old Prasad, squatting over a table in the corner, paintbrush in hand. To the old man’s left was a bag of golf balls; to his right a bag of finished “onions”.

“They will never rot, my friend,” explained Ahmed, “no flies, no mold, no bad breath, no problem, but no chutney either. We have some very distinguished customers indeed.” Prasad will soon expand his business to carving statues, figurines and jewelry “for those who can’t afford the real thing”.

Following the obligatory purchase of a 100 onion “mini Mayawati special” garland, “the number one present for any overly competitive UP housewife”, Faking News left the building Rs.200 lighter.

This is the first time a high profile politician has worn vegetables in public. However, after being inspired by Lady Gaga’s “meat outfit”, one Calcutta dog catcher has tripled his catch rate; and for years, both vegetologists and anatomists have claimed that Lalu Prasad’s head is a member of the potato family. But, it must be pointed out that the Potato Growers of India reject this entirely.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mayawati_onion_garland-250x213.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-wears-garland-made-of-onions-as-veg-prices-rise-1365,Mayawati wears garland made of onions as veg prices rise,,1293434137.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-spots-aam-aadmi-during-a-special-safari-1355,"Gorakhpur. After throwing his new favorite phrase around for months, Rahul Gandhi may have finally encountered the “aam aadmi“. Congress Party officials, keen to help their rising star define the much used term, organized a “safari” to enable Rahul to visit some of the most mundane, unexciting parts of UP and see the aam aadmi in his natural habitat.

The Gandhi caravan set out from Lucknow last week with fifteen Land cruisers, two Ambassadors (one of which made it up to 15km from the city before breaking down), a hundred staff and a statue of a leading state politician to conform to the local laws.

The brush with the aam aadmi happened on a dusty road outside Gorakhpur.

“Rahul was looking out of the window with his binoculars,” explained an aide, “then suddenly he shouted – look! look at that adult male… Aam aadmi?!”

Rahul Gandhi, immediately after spotting an “aam aadmi” during his safari

Rahul had been drawing blanks all day, explained the aide, once stopping the whole caravan by what turned out to be a “man shaped tree”. Two local “trackers” were quickly dispatched into the fields where they soon found a trail of trampled grass, scuffed earth and fresh paan stains, or “spores”, as they called them.

“Rahul followed 50m behind us with his bodyguards. We told him to be quiet as some common people are scared of politicians. We didn’t know if he’d be hostile, some people in UP still vote BJP, you know, it’s cowboy country for Rahul’s lot,” said Chandra, a “tracker”.

After identifying their target as an “aam aadmi” and allegedly pacifying him with a handful of peanuts and a beedi, the trackers signaled for Rahul to come forward. The Congress General Secretary then had a “brief and highly productive dialogue” with the “highly representative specimen”.

“Rahul is now very clear as to the appearance, behavior, mating behavior and feeding habits of the common man,” said a spokesman, “he even took some pictures for next year’s Lok Sabha calendar.”

Sources inside the Congress point out that Rahul’s exposure to the aam aadmi goes beyond this singular encounter. “He gave ten separate definitions last week,” said a spokeswoman, “I think he’s trying to fill the entire calendar.”

However, one individual observed by Gandhi in his search for the common man turned out to be a one-legged Punjabi Rastafarian who made a living as a professional unicyclist. Aides pointed out that Shumba Solomon Sachdev was a not a helpful example.

Faking News went to the dusty road outside Gorakhpur to talk to the aadmi in question: 48year-old farmer, Hotiram.

“That’s a load of rubbish,” Hotiram told us, “two men came out of the bushes, I said “hello” and they shot me with this.” He handed our correspondent a tranquillizer dart bearing the words “Delhi Zoo” on the shaft. “I woke up to find that chap from the newspapers looking down at me. I didn’t vote Congress last time so I thought it was payback,” he said. After allowing Hotiram a minute to regain his composure, the Amethi MP asked “are you the aam aadmi?”

“I said I supposed I was,” Hotiram told us, “then he started taking pictures and they put this tag on my ankle, aam aadmi 0000000001, it says.” Gandhi’s body guards then gave Hotiram Rs.500 for his troubles, telling him it was “NREGA”.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rahul_using_binoculars-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-spots-aam-aadmi-during-a-special-safari-1355,"Rahul Gandhi spots ""aam aadmi"" during a special safari",,1293011723.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In another major embarrassment for the Congress party and possibly US policymakers too, the latest cables released by WikiLeaks show that Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi had warned an US diplomat over rising might of Narnia, the mythical country depicted in The Chronicles of Narnia, a fantasy novel and movie series for children.

Rahul Gandhi had apparently suggested that while Al Qaida remained a big threat and Osama should be hunted down, USA should not ignore the developments in Narnia and keep an eye over the followers of Aslan, the talking lion who is widely regarded as the creator and lord of Narnia.

Aslan, the mighty lion from Narnia

“If some of our kids can get transported to Narnia through wardrobes and paintings, the Minotaurs and Ogres of Narnia can sneak into our world as well, isn’t it?” Rahul Gandhi is supposed to have told US envoy Timothy Roemer while pointing towards a painting at Manmohan Singh’s residence where they were attending a lunch hosted by the Indian Prime Minister in honor of visiting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last year.

Mr. Roemer had documented and signed these discussions and dispatched those (cables) to the US Department of State. Faking News undertook an extensive search for terms such as “LOL”, “FML”, “facepalm”, “WTF”, etc. on the leaked cables but couldn’t get any results, which suggests that perhaps even the US diplomat took Rahul’s comments seriously.

“Gandhi asked me if we (USA) had any envoy to Narnia, which we clearly don’t have. I think the State Department could look into this matter,” the US diplomat had mentioned in the cable, further stressing the need to find more about Aslan.

“It sounds like a hostile Muslim name,” the cable noted.

As always, US government has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the leaked cables but the revelations have given rise to another political controversy in India with BJP accusing Rahul Gandhi of being “childish” for believing in fantasy stuffs like existence of Land of Narnia.

“This also shows how uprooted Rahul Gandhi is from Indian realities. If he had to believe in some fantasy land, why does he not believe Naugarh and Vijaygarh of Chandrakanta? How unpatriotic!” BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad launched a scathing attack on the Congress general secretary.

But Congress has defended Rahul Gandhi’s statement even as no leader was willing to explain it.

“Rahul Gandhi believes in all fantasy lands, be it Narnia or Ayodhya,” was the explanation offered by former Madhya Pradesh CM and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh, though other Congress leaders dismissed it as his personal opinion.

“How can one doubt Indianness of someone whose father and grandmother laid down their lives for this country? These people have no patriotism left in their blood,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewary said, defending Rahul Gandhi’s alleged statement and explaining party’s official stand on the issue.

Meanwhile Faking News could talk to Timothy Roemer, who is currently serving as the US ambassador to India. Mr. Roemer confirmed that he indeed had talks about Narnia and Aslan with Rahul Gandhi during that lunch and he was mighty impressed with Gandhi’s knowledge on the issue.

“Gandhi offered me a lot more dope on the issue if I joined him for a dinner at some… what was it… umm… daddy’s… no…. yeah, at some dalit’s house; a chance I’m still waiting for. I look forward to get more information on this Aslan guy,” the US diplomat said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Narnia_Aslan-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-warned-us-of-rising-power-of-narnia-wikileaks-1346,Rahul Gandhi warned US of rising power of Narnia: WikiLeaks,,1292650917.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Mighty impressed with his ability to erase call records from telecom companies’ database with help of some secret technology, IIT here has decided to confer an honorary degree on Digvijay Singh, senior Congress leader and former CM of Madhya Pradesh.

The secret technology came to public knowledge when it was found that call records didn’t confirm the claims of Digvijay Singh about him talking to Hemant Karkare hours before he (Mr. Karkare, unfortunately) was killed fighting the terrorists during the Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008.

Digvijay Singh apparently has a special phone with his secretly developed technology that seamlessly erases the call records as soon as the conversation is over

“Of course he erased the call records; he can’t be lying,” Professor P K Dhutt of IIT Kanpur said.

“It’s amazing,” Professor Dhutt added, “it surpasses the hacking abilities of both Mark Zuckerberg and Julian Assange, and since he (Digvijay Singh) is from a party that idolizes Mahatma Gandhi, we have no option but to conclude that it was a case of ethical hacking.”

If Diggy Raja, as Digvijay Singh is respectfully called, accepts this offer from IIT Kanpur, he’d be awarded PhD in Electronics and Communications Engineering. In fact, IIT administration has suggested that Diggy Raja should file an application for patent over the technology that he had developed.

“Need for such a technology is being felt strongly all over the world,” Professor Dhutt explained, “imagine if all those who have been caught on tapes talking to Niira Radia could erase all the call records and claim that the released tapes were work of some mimicry artists.”

Professor Dhutt further informed that the institute was willing to spend on research and development and “enrich” the technology developed by Digvijay Singh so that in could be applied in other areas too.

“It could help us in curbing student suicides as well; badly performing students could simply erase their bad grades from our database with this technology and choose to start a new life,” Prof Dhutt wondered about the possibilities.

Meanwhile sources at IIT Kanpur reveal that Diggy Raja had almost lost this honorary degree to some unidentified “capable people” in BJP, whom he thought could tamper with WikiLeaks, rendering the whistleblower website to some kind of wiki site. But the latest revelations of missing called records clinched the deal for Diggy Raja.

Faking News tried to call up Digvijay Singh many times to get his reactions on this development, but all our calls were unanswered. Strangely, none of our mobile phones showed Digvijay Singh’s number in its outgoing call records list afterwards.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Digvijay_Singh.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/iit-honors-digvijay-singh-for-inventing-call-records-eraser-technology-1334,IIT honors Digvijay Singh for inventing call records eraser technology,,1292225967.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

After Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to Mayawati’s Noida Park project on conditions that at least 75% of the park should be “green”, BSP strategists have come up with an ingenious plan to bypass the verdict and install as many statues of Mayawati as possible.

Apart from constructing concrete statues, which was the original idea, now the park would have innumerable trees, plants, shrubs, and grass – all green and shaped into statues of elephants and Mayawati.

Tree outside parliament shaped like an elephant

“Trimming plants or grasses to shape them like some human or animal figure is not illegal or inimical to environmental concerns,” BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra argued, justifying the decision to install “green statues” of Mayawati, elephants and other dalit icons if there were any space left.

Mr. Mishra cited the example of a tree outside parliament shaped like an elephant and claimed that such structures had “parliamentary approval” to begin with. He also informed that BSP was happy with the court decision and trimming work in the Noida Park would begin next week.

Sources also inform that soon BSP would take up this “green revolution” of installing statues all over the state of Uttar Pradesh. A committee has already been formed to identify green trees and plants that could be trimmed into shapes of Mayawati.

“A special recruitment drive for gardening artists would be launched soon,” a BSP leader informed. These gardening artists would be joined by special police pickets that would make sure that the trimmed trees were not harmed by anti-dalit elements in the society.

BSP activists have already shaped a tree like Mayawati and are planning to gift it to behenji on her next birthday in January

In fact, BSP is planning to shape banyan trees into statues of Mayawati and start worshipping them by tying blue threads around them.

Experts believe that opposition parties would have a hard time opposing or challenging the latest move by the BSP as they might end up harming environment and hurting “religious sentiments” if they tried to deface or demolish the “green statues”.

“Maybe if Abhishek Bachchan and Idea Cellular file a copyright violation by claiming that it was their original idea to shape trees into human beings, the courts might issue a stay order,” a local lawyer suggested, “but with Amar Singh out of Samajwadi Party, who would convince Abhishek or Idea to take this step?”

“Or if some women groups end up claiming that the statues were ‘obscene’ to be in public places,” the lawyer suggested an alternative.

But with neither of the above two possibilities looking imminent in near future, BSP has already begun working on this grand green project, sources say.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/elephant-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/trees-in-noida-park-to-be-clipped-in-shape-of-elephants-and-mayawati-1313,Trees in Noida Park to be clipped in shape of Mayawati and Elephants,,1291449947.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

State Congress unit has refused to accept that Bihar assembly election results were in any way failure of Rahul Gandhi’s magic in electoral politics and has instead blamed Dolly Bindra among others for the party’s poor performance. Bihar unit of Congress has in fact congratulated Rahul Gandhi for his whirlwind tours that had attracted huge turnout of media reports.

“That’s nonsense,” Mukul Wasnik, the AICC general secretary in-charge for Bihar said when asked if the results proved that Rahul Gandhi’s “magic” failed to work in the state.

“Of course there was magic,” he reiterated, “but why are you trying to relate magic with reality? That’s such an unfair comparison. PC Sorcar Jr had made Taj Mahal disappear with his magic some 10 years ago, but we all know Taj Mahal is still there. So? Would you term that achievement as failure?”

Congress believes she scared the Bihar voters even as Rahul Gandhi did his best

Mr. Wasnik expressed confidence that the Yuvraaj would continue to cast his magical spells even as he blamed a myriad of things for electoral debacle, including Dolly Bindra, a heavyweight television personality.

“People hated her,” Mr. Wasnik said, “she was plump and cocky; almost reminded people of Lalu Yadav when he was at the helm of the affairs in Bihar. She spoilt the mood of people and out of this huge irritation people voted for JD(UP)-BJP combine.”

“She had full control over food in the Bigg Boss house,” he further explained, “maybe that reminded people of the fodder scam.”

There were dozens of other reasons and “explanations” that Mr. Wasnik and other state leaders of Congress came up with to explain the horrible performance of the grand old party in the elections, but none of them were ready to put any blame on Rahul Gandhi.

Maharashtra Congress committee has authorized party president Sonia Gandhi to decide the color and patterns of curtains that would replace the old rugged ones at the party office at Tilak Bhavan here. The decision was taken unanimously by the committee members, who later declared that the choice of Madam Gandhi would be acceptable and binding on everyone in the state unit of the grand old party.

“The process was natural and democratic,” senior party leader Pranab Mukherjee informed, who along with another senior leader A K Antony was deputed by the high command as observers to solve the “crisis at hand” after a newspaper published revealing images of stained and stinking curtains hanging in the party office.

Congress leaders are hopeful of the right decision and guidance from their party president

The resolution to authorize Sonia Gandhi was moved by the local party treasurer, and seconded by everyone present in the important meeting that lasted for 5 minutes.

Congress headquarters in Delhi have confirmed that the decision on new curtains for the Maharashtra office will be taken after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns to India tomorrow. It’s not yet clear why the party is waiting for Manmohan Singh to return when the decision has to be taken by Sonia Gandhi.

Meanwhile, highly placed sources within Congress have told us that the curtains were supposed to be replaced this Diwali itself as part of the customary annual cleaning of the office, but the funds for the same were used by the party leaders to buy clothes for themselves and their family members.

“BJP president Nitin Gadkari got a sherwani stitched for himself from a tent that was provided by Sudhanshu Mittal for party functions,” said Manish Tewary, the national spokesperson of Congress, thus logically, thoroughly and firmly disproving the charges of corruption within his party.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/homeless-people-to-have-mayawati-shaped-haircut-to-get-cover-2179,"Lucknow. After Election Commission ordered all Mayawati statues to be covered, homeless and poor people in Uttar Pradesh have decided to get a haircut that would cause Mayawati figurine to appear on their heads. The move is aimed at getting some piece of cloth in this cold weather.

Ignored by the political parties as many of them are not enrolled on voter lists, these people finally hope to get some attention by the system and the society this way.

“It’s too cold these days and some extra clothing will help,” Kabir Das, a homeless destitute in Lucknow told Faking News, “We have never been promised anything by anybody and we move around begging for our survival. Last winter an NGO had distributed blankets but we sold them off in summer to buy food.”

Cricket fans have earlier got haircut shaped in various figures, but this is the first time people will get Mayawati shaped haircuts.

“The NGO didn’t come back this year as they were busy supporting Jan Lokpal movement, so this looks like a god sent opportunity,” Kabir said, welcoming the Election Commission’s decision.

This year, the number of homeless beggars has increased as many of them had come back to the state after the famous election speech by Rahul Gandhi, but they were disappointed to learn that they were not welcome.

“We don’t even have homes where Rahul Gandhi could have dinner,” Kabir rued, “Now we hope Election Commission will cover us for having Mayawati statues on our head.”

However, experts on poverty working in the Planning Commission have claimed that the poor have failed to adequately plan for themselves.

“From our data, we have found out that having a funky haircut like that will cost at least 32 rupees. If they can spend that much in a day, they are not poor!” Maathatek Aluwala, a part-time economist with the Planning Commission showed the loophole.

“Furthermore, they will get only that much of cloth that will help cover the hair on their head, which means not much bigger than a handkerchief; they shouldn’t be expecting cozy blankets,” Aluwala provided a reality check to the poor during the season of electoral promises.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cricket_fan-227x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/homeless-people-to-have-mayawati-shaped-haircut-to-get-cover-2179,Homeless people to have Mayawati shaped haircut to get cover,,1325954754.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-goes-for-massive-rebranding-to-call-itself-party-ok-2177,"New Delhi. After receiving a lot of criticism for inducting Babu Singh Kushwaha, accused of corruption in a multi-crore rural health scam in Uttar Pradesh, BJP has decided to rebrand and reposition itself to get back the lost support among critics and masses.

In a move that looks clearly inspired from the television entertainment channel Star One, which was re-launched as “Life OK” a few weeks back, BJP has decided to call itself “Party OK”. The new name will be launched on the eve of Uttar Pradesh elections.

“Our candidates will contest elections on the BJP symbol only, and even the ballot papers will mention our party’s name as ‘BJP’, but we’ll call ourselves ‘Party OK’ during all public meets,” BJP President Nitin Gadkari declared.

Sources inform that through this attempt, the party has made its positioning more real and practical from the earlier positioning of “party with a difference”.

Management consultants claim that the new logo will change the fortunes of the party

“That positioning raised false hopes among many supporters who thought the party will not indulge in petty politics for immediate electoral gains,” a party source said, “That’s why we are now calling ourselves ‘Party OK’, so that people know that we just about OK.”

“A party that is just good enough,” the source added.

It’s not yet clear how much money BJP is spending on this whole rebranding exercise, but sources inform that the party had hired leading brand professionals from the industry, who suggested that BJP started calling itself “Party OK”.

“They have also prepared a document on how to lead the fight against corruption,” a party source said, “The document uses some of the key strategies adopted by US in its war against terror, where it invaded many nations for world peace.”

Most of the party leaders and workers have welcomed the decision and have called it “timely”.

“It was much needed,” a party leader told Faking News on conditions of anonymity, “Look what happened to Team Anna. They positioned themselves as messiah against corruption and hence when minor irregularities like inflated travel bills of Kiran Bedi came to light, it hurt them.”

“Same with Sachin Tendulkar,” the party leader further explained, “The positioning as ‘god’ is hurting him. People think he has failed even if he scores a half century in each innings. We must learn from these.”

Party insiders say that the move will not only justify admission of leaders like Kushwaha, but it will also help the party in reinstating leaders like BS Yeddyurappa, the former Chief Minister of Karnataka who had to resign after a state Lokayukta report indicted him in mining scam.

“Yeddy had asked for a suitable post in BJP recently for his homecoming, he could be made in-charge of this rebranding process,” a party insider said.

Taking a cue from Rajya Sabha, which suspended proceedings abruptly as soon as the clock struck 12 in the midnight, a dalit family hosting Rahul Gandhi for dinner asked the Congress MP to leave their house as soon as they realized that it was end of the calendar day.

Rahul Gandhi had eaten just one roti (bread) when Dhaniram, the host, asked him to leave his house as the day reserved for showing hospitality to Rahul Gandhi had come to an end.

“We were having a nice chat and Rahul Baba was showing Dhaniram live television on his 3G enabled Aakash tablet gifted to him by Kapil Sibal,” a Congress worker, who had accompanied Rahul Gandhi, recalled the events of the last night.

Rahul Gandhi was shocked but didn't comment anything over the incident

Dhaniram asked Rahul Gandhi to show him news channels to check if his name and face was already on national television for hosting the future Prime Minister of India. Rahul obliged, but to his disappointment, Dhaniram found all the news channels broadcasting Parliament proceedings instead of breaking news on Rahul Gandhi having dinner at a dalit household.

“Rahul Baba explained something about Lokpal, but my mood was already off by then,” Dhaniram confided his honest feelings to Faking News, “I had paid a bribe of 500 rupees to the local agent who had promised that I will be popular after Rahul Gandhi visited my home. But there was not a single journalist covering the event! Only you Faking News guys were there! WTF!”

Adding to his woes was the half-an-hour explanation by Rahul Gandhi on how the Sarkari Lokpal can tackle corruption better than Jan Lokpal.

“To hell with all kind of Lokpals, I was more concerned about my 500 rupees and the food that I had invested to earn some fame,” Dhaniram said.

Already frustrated and exasperated at his loss, Dhaniram went mad when Rajya Sabha was adjourned sine die as soon as it was midnight. This killed all hopes of any non-Lokpal news being flashed.

“All that they were talking on TV was how the day had ended and no business could take place any further, while the disastrous day that I was having appeared to extend forever,” Dhaniram recalled how his wife started quarrelling with him as she had to cook food for five extra persons – Rahul Gandhi, his security guards, and the agent who fleeced Dhaniram.

However, the Parliament proceedings gave Dhaniram an idea on how to put an end to his sufferings. He immediately announced that the day had ended and the honorable Rahul Gandhi must leave his house keeping with the lofty traditions of the Indian parliament.

This left everyone stunned, as if Tendulkar was bowled at 99.

After regaining their composure, Congress workers tried to reason with Dhaniram but he remained adamant. The red faced agent even offered to fix a Walk The Talk appointment with Shekhar Gupta on NDTV, but Dhaniram was not ready to believe anyone anymore. Rahul Gandhi had to leave his house after having just one roti and a small bite off a pyaaz (onion).

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/only-copy-of-lokpal-bill-prepared-by-the-government-goes-missing-2150,"New Delhi. In a shocking development that has scared the collective shit of the government representatives, the only copy of the much touted long-held ‘Lokpal Bill’ has suddenly gone missing. UPA ministers, who were handling the strings of the allegedly path-breaking bill, were left red faced as media and activists probed the whereabouts of the anti-corruption antidote.

“The bill was, umm…” Abhishek Manu Singhvi, averred, “was in my closet. I had kept it myself the last night before going to enjoy some red wine with Sibal Sahib after completing all the formalities.”

The draft of the bill was gone in the morning. It was probably a theft because Singhvi woke up to find a big black letter ‘A’ embossed in steel lying in his closet, instead of the copy of the bill. Singhvi, using his lawyer’s mind, could immediately draw parallels with the Dhoom2, where the thief-in-chief Hrithik Roshan would place a similar letter after every heist.

Earlier, copies of Lokpal Bill prepared by the government was burnt by the civil society activists, following which the government decided to have only one fire-proof copy of the bill.

Sources inform that Home Minister P Chidambaram has already ordered a midnight lathicharge on Hrithik Roshan’s fans as he suspects Hrithik to have stolen the only copy of the bill to promote his new movie Agneepath – a movie name starting with ‘A’.

“Anna, Anna – that name also starts with A! Arrest him!” a voice, suspected to be that of Digvijay Singh, was heard in an emergency meeting called by Sonia Gandhi in the morning to find the bill. Leaders like Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan, who has invaluable experience in the case of missing files related to the Adarsh Society scam, were also present in the meeting, sources say.

Later talking exclusively to Faking News, Manu Singhvi explained that no other copy of the bill was made since earlier leaks had forced the government to be extra careful. He and Sibal were apparently working on further improvements in the draft last night as government had agreed to extend the winter session to discuss the bill and get it passed.

“While done with the last line at 11:32 in the night, I had jubilantly high-five’d the coarse hands of Sibalji,” recalled Singhvi, “and the keys had been in my boxer pockets all the night.”

“Zameen nigal gayi ya aasman kha gaya,” said angry BJP MP BS Ahluwalia, who warned to stop the parliament session till the bill was found. He also accused Congress of playing tricks and claimed that the party had deliberately allowed the theft to delay formation of a Lokpal.

He went so far to say that Kapil Sibal turns into a werewolf after two glasses of wine, and he might have taken the bill along with him or kept it somewhere.

“CBI should ‘zero-in’ on Sibal,” he said and asked Anna to go on a fast demanding arrest of Kapil Sibal.

However Anna Hazare has blamed BJP too this time, since he held the opinion that BJP was never interested in bringing the bill because once implemented, many of its own leaders would have behind the bars or tied around a pole to be whipped by a mother-like figure. He said that the conspiracy would be busted soon and offered the media a copy of Jan-Lokpal as the only solution.

Meanwhile, sensing an impending danger, all the thieves have left Delhi and spread all over the country, thus bringing even distribution of thieves in the country as earlier they were all concentrated in and around the capital.

There is no hint so far about the whereabouts of the bill. Manu Singhvi could be subjected to ‘Sach Ka Saamna‘ and be asked specific questions about the PM, lower bureaucracy, and other unresolved matters to get a final word of truth.

Reacting to the news, people have responded in a bit of aggression: Pawar has been slapped again, a chappal was thrown at Chidambaram, and Sibal’s twitter profile was hacked with status updated to ‘F–k me’.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Burning_Lokpal_Bill-250x168.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/only-copy-of-lokpal-bill-prepared-by-the-government-goes-missing-2150,Only copy of Lokpal Bill prepared by the government goes missing,,1324455104.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taj-mahal-to-be-relocated-to-delhi-to-celebrate-100-years-of-the-city-2134,"New Delhi. The central government has decided to shift Taj Mahal to the national capital to celebrate 100 years of Delhi as the capital city of India. The master plan was approved in a cabinet meeting early this morning; the relocation work is slated to begin in February next year and is believed to conclude by the next birthday of Delhi. The move is aimed at boosting the image of the capital city as well as earning revenues from tourism.

“Tourist visits to Taj Mahal will go up many times if the monument is shifted to Delhi,” tourism minister Subodh Kant Sahay explained the rationale, “Last year US President Barack Obama had come to India but he couldn’t visit Taj Mahal as it was in Agra, away from Delhi. We have been working on this plan ever since.”

Mr. Sahay claimed that with Delhi completing 100 years, the government thought it an opportune moment to execute this pending task. He denied that there was anything “wrong” in the move.

The tourism revenues could help India deal with the balance of payment crisis, experts say.

“We have enough information to prove that Agra was chosen randomly by Shah Jahan. Neither Mumtaz Mahal was born nor did she die there. In fact, she was buried at Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh, from where her body was exhumed at taken to Agra to be buried at Taj,” Sahay informed.

“And it’s not even so that Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal met for the first time at Agra. There is no emotional significance of Agra as far as the love story between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal goes. If it was due to Yamuna River, then we have Yamuna flowing through Delhi as well and we will relocate Taj Mahal at Yamuna bank only! My point is, it was an administrative decision to make Taj Mahal at Agra,” he added.

Sahay therefore claimed that the government was merely reversing an administrative decision of a previous government of Delhi (led by Shah Jahan) by relocating Taj Mahal, and not hurting any sentiments as Taj Mahal will continue to exist as a monument of love and burial place of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.

However, the announcement has been opposed by all the political parties in Uttar Pradesh, where Agra is located.

BSP has termed the move “anti-dalit”.

“Taj Mahal was not built by Shah Jahan, but it was built by those thousands of manual laborers, sculptors, and masons who were definitely dalits and poor. Rahul Gandhi has shown disrespect to them by ordering Taj Mahal to be shifted to Delhi, which will be done by big construction companies run by his foreign friends,” BSP leader and UP Chief Minister Mayawati alleged.

Samajwadi Party has termed the move an insult to the Muslims of India and vowed not to allow Taj Mahal to be shifted out of Agra, while BJP has claimed that the move by Congress was aimed at finishing the kirana shopkeepers and small businessmen in Agra, who were earning their livelihood through tourism in the city.

But it seems that Congress is in no mood to rollback this decision as it doesn’t involve Mamata Banjerjee. Party sources reveal that Congress has a plan ready to tackle all the major opposition forces in UP.

“Mayawati will be allowed to go ahead with her Taj Corridor project and develop real estate in and around the area. She can install a grand statue of herself where Taj existed to promote tourism. We believe it will be a fair deal,” a Congress source revealed.

Party has decided to offer Samajwadi Party a permanent gag on Amar Singh in lieu of their support on the decision, while Digvijay Singh has been asked to deal with BJP. Digvijay Singh is supposed to viciously attack claims that Taj Mahal was earlier a Hindu temple, which will lure BJP into opposing the existence of Taj Mahal at Agra in its current form.

Meanwhile common people at Agra are angry and confused over the whole issue.

“If Delhi takes away our resources for development at least they should compensate us for that. How about shifting Delhi Metro to Agra?” Ankur, a local resident argued.

“What the hell! This whole relocation process is going to be another scam. If there is anything in Agra that needs to be shifted to Delhi, it’s the mental asylum!” another local resident said on conditions of anonymity.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Taj_Mahal-250x191.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/taj-mahal-to-be-relocated-to-delhi-to-celebrate-100-years-of-the-city-2134,Taj Mahal to be relocated to Delhi to celebrate 100 years of the city,,1323671450.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mps-react-with-laughter-over-no-work-no-pay-demand-2120,"New Delhi. With no business taking place in the Parliament due to frequent adjournments and disruptions, many citizen groups have been clamoring for “no work, no pay” rule to be applied to the MPs. Citizens believe that MPs, whose prime duty is to legislate and debate policies, shouldn’t be given salaries if they fail to perform their duty.

When Faking News contacted a group of MPs for their response to such demands, most of them couldn’t control their laughter.

“It’s a good idea, ha ha ha, sorry, I mean it’s a good idea. LOL!” said an MP, who later excused himself from the interview as he was finding the whole exercise too funny.

Some MPs privately claimed that it was actually disruptions that was their job

This reporter later checked himself in the mirror to find out if he was looking too outlandish or weird to conduct an interview, but failed to spot any oddity in appearance. The reporter resembled any other aam aadmi, which was confirmed later as a couple of small interviews with other aam aadmis went very well.

“Frankly I don’t know why people care if the parliament functions or not, isn’t the country being run by corporate houses?” said Indrajeet, an aam aadmi reading an essay by Arundhati Roy in a nearby library.

“Yes, the parliament must function. I’m sick of Lok Sabha TV not airing anything and yet the Doordarshan employees getting salary. This is double waste of taxpayers’ money,” opined Kamlesh, who couldn’t pay his cable TV bills due to rising inflation, and is now dependent on only Doordarshan channels for entertainment.

“All I want is that they should not adjourn the house. They should keep shouting, and if possible, throw mikes at each other,” Kamlesh, deprived of reality shows entertainment from private TV channels, demanded.

With two normal reactions from normal people, this reporter was assured that there was nothing funny in his appearance and proceeded to conclude the original assignment. However, subsequent attempts to get a reaction from MPs over “no work, no pay” continued to elicit laughter from honorable members of the parliament.

“They think we survive on our salaries? LOL!” said another MP, constantly on phone with some Amar bhai.

“Ha ha, who are these people trying to dictate terms to us?” responded another MP, “Some guys tried to do that earlier this year wearing Anna topis (caps). What happened? LOL!”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/parliament-250x208.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mps-react-with-laughter-over-no-work-no-pay-demand-2120,"MPs react with “LOL” over “no work, no pay” demands by citizens",,1322810462.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-be-converted-into-amusement-park-to-recover-lost-money-2110,"New Delhi. Reacting to criticisms that the nation was losing 2 crore rupees each day due to parliament being adjourned randomly, government has decided to convert the parliament into an amusement park. Once any house of the Parliament is adjourned, an aam aadmi will be able to buy tickets and see MPs doing things that will amuse him or her no end. The scheme will be launched for Lok Sabha first.

“No, we are not doing away with the parliament itself or the law making process; Parliament will do that on odd days,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal clarified, “But on most of the days, when no business takes place inside the parliament, instead of leaving for their homes or the canteen, our MPs will stay back and indulge in things that will amuse people – something that we are calling amusement park.”

Soon, this place will be earning money for the nation.

Parliament sources say that the idea popped into a Samajwadi Party MP’s mind when he saw Lalu Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav playing cards in one corner. Soon, the creative Kabil Sibal came up with a rough blueprint of the whole proposal that will bring down the loss due to non-functioning of the parliament to his favorite number – zero.

It was proposed that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be the usher at the door who would introduce airs of joviality through his phrases and facial gestures. If the visitors fail to laugh at the jokes of Sidhu, they will be taken to the region where Rahul Gandhi will be speaking on national issues.

Sonia Gandhi will be having her own puppet show, while DMK members will run telephone booths.

A toy train will also be installed inside the premises that will be driven by senior BJP leader LK Advani. The joy ride will be called “Rath Yatra” but visitors will not be charged any extra ticket to ride the toy train.

However, visitors will have to pay extra to see Mayawati’s statue, which is being touted as the main attraction.

Mr. Sharad Pawar would be given a small area to plough so that he may better understand the plight of the farmer. Sources claim that he would also be wearing a head gear so that nobody slaps him, but Faking News can’t confirm this.

The proposal of setting up of the amusement park was accepted by a voice vote by both the houses of the parliament. The “park” will be open for public viewing next week when the Lok Sabha adjourns as soon as it starts.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Parliament-250x210.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/parliament-to-be-converted-into-amusement-park-to-recover-lost-money-2110,Parliament to be converted into amusement park to recover lost money,,1322474593.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-buys-minority-stake-in-bjp-sees-bright-future-as-an-opposition-party-2108,"New Delhi. The ruling Congress party today announced that it has acquired a minority stake in the main opposition party BJP for an undisclosed amount. Justifying this rather weird decision, Congress said that the party saw very bright future for BJP as a vibrant opposition party for many more years to come and hence decided to make an investment.

“BJP will continue to be the dominant opposition party after the next general elections, and we don’t see any change in the fortunes of the party even after the subsequent elections,” senior party leader Kapil Sibal claimed, “With such a secured and guaranteed future, we decided to invest in the party. Yesterday we bought 7.5% of the total outstanding shares of BJP.”

BJP members opposing something in the Parliament

The shares were bought through private placement method and the sum paid has not been disclosed. Sources suggest that Sibal had used his own accounting method and had found out the unit price of BJP shares at zero rupees, but his valuation was overturned by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who worked out a favorable deal with the BJP.

“We are sure that our investment will not go waste,” Sibal later told Faking News, “BJP has mastered the art of opposition and it has become the core competence of the party. They are really good at opposing and we hope that they will keep on opposing and growing as an opposition party.”

Congress sources reveal that the idea of having a minority stake in BJP was mooted a few months before 2009 general elections itself, when BJP opposed Indo-US nuclear deal – something that they might have done themselves had they been in power.

“Then we were not too sure. Now when they are opposing FDI in retail, we thought that time was ripe for making an investment in BJP – a party that opposes better than any other,” Sibal said.

Although 7.5% ownership does doesn’t give Congress decision making powers, the party has decided to appoint Digvijay Singh as the self-appointed director on the board of BJP. Digvijay Singh will make sure that BJP keeps on opposing things, and does only that, nothing else.

Sources say that the first step that Digvijay Singh has decided to take is to buy out an extra 0.36% of total outstanding shares of BJP from the open market.

“This will make the total holding of Congress at 7.86%, something that the BJP will start opposing as minority appeasement and will try to buy back the shares at much higher price,” a Congress source revealed.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/loksabha-bjp-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/congress-buys-minority-stake-in-bjp-sees-bright-future-as-an-opposition-party-2108,"Congress buys minority stake in BJP, sees bright future as an opposition party",,1322387095.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-announces-formation-of-four-new-castes-promises-quota-2104,"Lucknow. After announcing that four new states would be formed out of existing Uttar Pradesh, BSP supremo Mayawati has announced formation of four new castes out of existing castes. These castes, names of which will be announced later in a rally, will get benefits of quota in government jobs and educational institutes.

“If we come back to power, we will constitute four new castes for better development of people of Uttar Pradesh,” Mayawati read out a written statement, “People can apply for membership of these castes, and if selected, they will be declared underprivileged, following which they will be eligible for reservations.”

Want a new identity? Mayawati asks voters.

The names of the new castes and the process of selection of candidates to be included in the new castes have not been announced yet, which has given rise to many rumors.

“I think they are going to auction memberships like cricketers are auctioned in IPL for inclusion in teams,” Prof. Santosh Sahay, a sociologist working with Lucknow University claimed, “This will make sure that money is generated for the party – a pattern that BSP follows in every decision making process.”

When asked how can those, who can take part in a competitive bidding process and “buy” memberships, be later declared as “underprivileged” and needing government support, Prof. Sahay cited the example of Dr. Vijay Mallya.

“Even he took part in the IPL auctions and bought many players, but did that stop him from seeking help and support from the government?” the professor argued.

“Recently even the ceiling for being categorized as creamy-layer in OBC category was also changed and those earning a lakh rupee per month were deemed eligible for reservations; so I think Mayawati can defend her decision to auction the caste memberships,” he added.

Currently, the constitution of India doesn’t allow a person to change his or her caste, which means that the central government would need to bring about a constitutional amendment to implement the latest announcement by the Mayawati government.

“I have already written a letter to the Prime Minister to this effect,” Mayawati put the onus on the center.

As expected, opposition parties in UP have reacted sharply with Samajwadi Party accusing Mayawati of conspiring to weaken the strength of OBCs by converting them into new castes. Congress too has opposed the move with Rahul Gandhi terming those who seek to change their castes as “beggars”, while BJP has favored merger of all castes into one large “Hindu” caste.

Political experts believe that the latest decision of Mayawati is aimed at winning the next year’s assembly elections. “Instead of reaching out to already existing vote banks, she is trying to create a new vote bank,” a political expert concluded after three hours of analysis.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-begging-uttar-pradesh-maharashtra-2078,"New Delhi. After Rahul Gandhi’s “beggar” comment drew sharp reactions from various quarters, central government has decided to silence critics by formulating Rahul Gandhi Regional Begging Alms Guarantee Act. The act guarantees a minimum of 32 rupees as daily alms for every beggar who doesn’t leave his home state to beg.

“Now no one from Uttar Pradesh needs to go to Maharashtra to beg,” Congress leader Pramod Tewari announced with a clear sign of vindication and victory over his face.

The act, which will be passed in the parliament when it meets for the winter session, will be first implemented in Phulpur, Uttar Pradesh, where Rahul Gandhi made those comments.

Why do you need to go to Maharashtra to beg when you can beg back home itself? Rahul Gandhi has thrown this poser to the youth of Uttar Pradesh.

Once the act is passed and becomes a law, every beggar in India will need to go back to the state he or she originally belonged to, and get registered with the local police station. Beggars will have to pledge never to leave their home state again, following which they would be given 32 rupees daily, an amount enough to survive in urban India as calculated by Planning Commission.

“I wish Rahul ji had issued this statement much earlier and this law was a reality last year itself. We wouldn’t have needed to remove the beggars during the Commonwealth Games,” Delhi CM Sheila Dixit welcomed the idea behind BAGA i.e. Rahul Gandhi Regional Begging Alms Guarantee Act.

Congress leaders claim that BAGA is an important step towards legalizing begging, which was made a punishable offence by laws such as Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959. Many NGOs and social activists have been opposing such acts.

“Rahul Gandhi is a visionary leader. He had meetings with such NGOs and activists earlier and was determined to remove laws that outlawed begging,” Pramod Tewari explained why Rahul Gandhi made that beggar remark in the Phulpur rally yesterday.

Expectedly, non-Congress parties have expressed disappointment with provisions of BAGA.

MNS and Shiv Sena have demanded that the law should be imposed on all bhaiyyas (residents of UP and Bihar) and they should be asked to go back home, while BJP has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

But the proposed law has received some good reviews from police officers and social scientists.

“We are ready to receive the BAGA funds and disburse it to the beggars registered with us,” inspector Kishan Kamishan told Faking News with a hint of anticipation in his tone, “32 rupees is more than enough. In fact, 25 rupees would be enough, but we’ll make sure they get 32 rupees.”

“This is a practical step,” Priyadarshan Thakur, a professor of history at Lucknow University said, “Earlier we had seen Indira Gandhi giving the slogan of ‘gareebi hatao’ but it didn’t change a thing in the lives of the poor. At least now they will get some money.”",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/rahul_gandhi1.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-begging-uttar-pradesh-maharashtra-2078,Begging Alms Guarantee Act proposed to stop UP folks from begging in Maharashtra,,1321348969.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-to-become-prime-minister-of-india-on-childrens-day-2076,"New Delhi. Congress has decided to honor the children of India by making Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister of the country on the occasion of Children’s Day tomorrow. Rahul Gandhi, who represents the young generation and is often referred as the crown prince, will become “PM for a day” tomorrow. However, this won’t be merely a symbolic appointment; the decisions taken by Rahul as PM will be treated as legitimate and binding.

The decision to have a special Prime Minister on Children’s Day was taken after a Priyanka Gandhi loyalist proposed that her school going kids should be made the PM to celebrate the day. As it involved members of the “family”, everyone in the party agreed to the proposal, but the plan was shelved at the last moment after Priyanka’s kids insisted on having Doraemon as the President of India after removing Pratibha Devisingh Patil.

Are you smarter than a 5th grader? Rahul Gandhi could be asking the nation once he becomes the Prime Minister.

This is when Digvijay Singh stepped in and proposed to make Rahul Gandhi the special Prime Minister on Children’s Day.

“Rahul is the youngest child of the family after Varun left us to join BJP. And not only us, even others consider him as a young child. Remember Amul Baby?” a Congress source told Faking News, “All of us have waited long to see him as the Prime Minister of the country but he was not obliging us. Finally, we convinced him to be the PM for a day.”

As per the planned events, Rahul Gandhi will take over from Dr. Manmohan Singh at the stroke of midnight tonight.

“It will be India’s new tryst with destiny,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh underscored the importance of the event.

Rahul will be briefed about the duties and powers of a Prime Minister the whole night and will start issuing orders and directives as soon as the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) opens on Monday morning.

“It’s important to brief him about the real duties and powers invested in the post of Prime Minister by the constitution of India,” a PMO source explained, “We fear that he might be having completely different ideas about them the way he has seen Manmohan Singh functioning till date.”

It’s not yet clear what important decisions Rahul could take in a day, but among the immediate issues that could be brought before him are the possible bailout of Kingfisher Airlines, bail to Kanimozhi, and Sachin’s awaited 100th century at Kolkata test that also starts tomorrow.

“There are many other things Rahul Baba can do. I have gifted him the CD of Nayak,” said Digvijay Singh, who could act as the special adviser to the PM for a day.

Party sources further reveal that Rahul Gandhi could also order a cut in petrol prices, which is expected to be announced by the state owned oil companies next week. This will make sure that the credit for the good work goes to Rahul Gandhi even though Manmohan Singh would be back as Prime Minister next week.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/rahul_gandhi-233x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-to-become-prime-minister-of-india-on-childrens-day-2076,Rahul Gandhi to become Prime Minister of India on Children’s Day,,1321177524.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will don the role of a television commentator during the West Indies tour of India and will be heard describing events during the first two test matches at Delhi and Kolkata respectively. This will be done to silence critics who always accuse the PM of not speaking up on the issues that are otherwise being hotly debated by the citizens of India.

“Sachin’s 100th international century will become the most hotly debated topic starting tomorrow, replacing petrol price hike,” a PMO source told Faking News, “Prime Minister will air his views on the topic live and exclusive on DD Sports.”

It’s been often said that Dr. Manmohan Singh is an overrated economist and underrated politician, but experts believe that he is also an unrated commentator.

Manmohan Singh showing his latest tool

“The Delhi test match will prove his worth as a commentator who can air his views on any topic,” an expert on Manmohan Singh said, “It’s nice that he has chosen a test match to start his commentary career, as there are extended periods of maiden overs where nothing happens on the ground.”

“He can keep mum in those periods, which will make him feel at home,” the expert explained.

First test-match against West Indies starts tomorrow at Delhi and Prime Minister is expected to join the likes of Ravi Shastri and Sunil Gavaskar in describing the proceedings from the stadium. However, PM will not speak on matters concerning spot-fixing in cricket.

“We expect commentators to discuss the punishment to Pakistani players in the spot-fixing controversy during the first test, but Manmohan Singh will stay clear of commenting on matters involving corruption and cheating,” a PMO source revealed.

PM will, however, take lead and analyze data and numbers such as run-rate, over-rate, and other statistical figures related to the match and cricketers.

Dr. Singh will then travel to Kolkata for his second term during the second test where he could be joined by Mamata Banerjee in the commentary box.

“That will be the real test of character for Dr. Singh,” an expert claimed, “Mamatadi could become an aggressive partner and Prime Minister might have tough time thinking out of (commentary) box.”

However some political pundits believe that Manmohan Singh is being prepared for an alternative career as Rahul Gandhi could soon replace him, once inflation graph reaches its peak and starts a downward trend.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Manmohan-Singh-250x214.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/manmohan-singh-to-do-commentary-during-test-matches-against-west-indies-2060,Manmohan Singh to do commentary during test matches against West Indies,,1320499909.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Stung by the criticism that it asked CBI to go slow on corruption cases against some of the opposition leaders to secure their support in the parliament, UPA government has decided to put CBI blimps everywhere in the country to underscore the assertion that it was a free body driven by its own free will. These blimps would not be chained and would be freely floating in all the leading cities of India.

“There have been misleading media reports that suggest that the government had struck a deal with likes of Lalu Yadav, Mayawati or A Raja to let them get away with CBI probe in lieu of their respective parties’ support to the government. This is all baseless and malicious. We want to send out a message that CBI was an independent body.” Information and Broadcasting Minister Ms. Ambika Soni said.

CBI blimps would soon be seen in the skies

Announcing the decision at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium here, Ms. Soni also released the maiden CBI blimp on the occasion. The blimp went up high in the air and kept hovering over the stadium for the whole duration of the press conference, attracting jibes from the journalists present.

“Madam, there is no activity or motion at all. Is that how CBI functions?” asked independent journalist Jarnail Singh, who had flung shoes at P Chidambaram last year to protest CBI’s clean chit to politicians accused of leading anti-Sikh riots.

Ms. Soni tried to justify the behavior of blimp by claiming that it was keeping an eye over the stadium that hosted a few IPL matches as IPL scam was on the top of the agenda of the government as of now.

“Please be patient and allow us to put more blimps in other cities. You’d get your answers and people would know that the CBI is on move.” Ms. Soni said.

Government has expressed confidence that the move will reiterate and emphasize CBI’s contribution towards making of a corruption-free India in the same way as MRF blimps underscored the contribution of MRF Pace Foundation to Indian cricket. But a few marketing experts differ.

“MRF is in business of making tyres, which are hollow from inside, so a blimp went well with their positioning. But an investigation agency is not expected to be hollow! It should have a strong internal structure and its motion must not be influenced just by hot airs. I’m not sure if this will send out a right message.” Aulad Kakkar, a marketing guru said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/blimp-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-planning-to-put-cbi-blimps-everywhere-in-the-country-815,Government planning to put CBI blimps everywhere in the country,,1272441053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Twenty eight years old Dheer Gambhir (not his original name), a first time MP who won as an independent candidate in the last general elections, has accused some senior MPs of ragging him for over a month inside the parliament premises.

This is the first reported incident of ragging inside the parliament and it has shocked everyone beyond belief. Gambhir has leveled serious allegations against many senior Lok Sabha MPs belonging to various national and regional parties.

What’s going on inside?

“They would ask me to do really absurd stuff and claim that it would only prepare me better to take part in the parliamentary proceedings. Once they asked me to sit on a boiled egg and break it into various parts without touching it with my hands. When I somehow did that, they asked me to measure the length of all the broken parts, saying it would complete the ‘divide and rule’ lesson. It was disgusting,” Gambhir alleged.

Gambhir further alleged that other first time MPs were also subjected to such horrifying and sadistic treatment by older MPs. His most shocking revelation was the claim that older MPs also ordered the younger MPs to perform acts that were obscene and amounted to sexual harassment.

“Once they applied sugar syrup all over my body and asked my fellow first timer to lick it. The other MP was also a man (sic.) and I didn’t enjoy this gay licking at all. They made us go through this horrible stuff after we had asked a question in Zero Hour related to continual export of sugar by India even though our domestic stocks were depleting. Apparently none of them thought the question made any sense,” Gambhir leveled further horrifying allegations.

The senior MPs, cutting across party lines, have termed the allegations of Gambhir as baseless and have accused him of being mentally deranged.

But Gambhir has already lodged a police complaint in this regard against thirteen MPs aged between 55 and 75 years, belonging to different parties. Faking News has decided not to print the names of these MPs until the case comes out open in the public domain once the courts or the police take some action. That might take some time as Delhi police is clueless over the next logical step in the case and are planning to meet the Speaker of Lok Sabha tomorrow to seek guidance.

“It’s a very complicated case. Supreme Court had outlawed ragging but that was for educational institutes. Although parliament resembles a college with rowdy students, technically it’s not an educational institute. Then you have these privileges enjoyed by parliamentarians that safeguard them against any punitive action. Delhi police would need some legal opinion before proceeding,” a noted lawyer and constitutional expert told Faking News, handing out his business card.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/parliament-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/first-time-mp-alleges-ragging-by-seniors-inside-parliament-premises-128,First time MP alleges ragging by seniors inside Parliament premises,,1271515806.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Samajwadi Party has decided to take the fight for social justice to the next battle and has demanded reservations in private jobs for those young men, who can’t help themselves but to whistle at girls found in the industrial houses. The move comes close to the immaculate observation by the party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, who envisioned whistles going left and right in the parliament once Women’s Reservation Bill was passed.

“There is a large percentage of young men who drop jaws when they see chick looking girls, many of whom work in these corporate houses. These young men can’t help but to gawk at these girls and in the process are branded uncultured and unfit for a healthy work atmosphere. This is a clear case of social discrimination.” party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhry said.

Some people think that women working in corporate are devious and make helpless and honest guys whistle at them

Samajwadi Party has demanded that since these whistleblowers (sic) find it tough to crack private job interviews, as they keep on looking at the good looking female HR executives, there should be reservation for such guys in all the private sector jobs. Party has demanded 33% reservation for such guys.

“These women have been dressing up smart and sexy for long and making these poor guys uncomfortable. We could as well have asked for a ban on such women for taking away rights of these unfortunate whistleblowers, but we believe in social justice and there is nothing better way to achieve equality than reservations.” Chaudhry said.

The demand by the party has received mixed reactions from various quarters with corporate India almost unanimous in condemning the idea. Legal experts were divided over the constitutional validity of the demand and pointed out that identification and listing of such whistleblowers might not be an easy job, but a few social scientists have termed the demand worth a deliberation.

“The society has to shed the elitist mentality and dispassionately analyse the issue. If we can have people in the parliament who can whistle at women, what’s wrong if they are given jobs?” argued Rajendra Raju, a thinker.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bipasha_basu-236x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sp-asks-for-reservation-in-private-sector-jobs-for-youth-whistling-at-women-751,SP asks for reservation in private sector jobs for youth whistling at women,,1269699621.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-farmer-puts-up-mayawati-statues-as-scarecrow-jailed-749,"Ballia, Uttar Pradesh. A local farmer has been jailed for putting up a statue of Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati as a scarecrow (human shaped effigy put up to scare away birds from eating grains and other farm produces) in his farm. The act of the farmer has been deemed as one creating public disorder and damage to the state property, but the farmer has termed it as an ingenious attempt to improve his agricultural yield.

“I have no intentions to disrespect behenji. My act has been misinterpreted.” pleaded Kishan Ram, currently locked up in the local police station. Kishan said that by putting up Mayawati’s statue in his field, he was making sure that the local administration paid full attention to the area, which happened to be his farm.

Mayawati statue put up as scarecrow in the farm by Kishan. (Inset: a normal scarecrow)

Kishan further informed that he got the idea after reading a news report where it was mentioned that Mayawati spent more on statues than on farmers of Uttar Pradesh.

“It’s foolish to expect that behenji would stop spending on statues. Instead, we should try to come up with ideas that could benefit statues as well as other items such as agriculture.” Kishan explained his rationale, and denied that he had any feelings of malice towards the Chief Minister.

Kishan believes that all the farmers should follow suit and put up life-size statues of Mayawati in their farms after paying full respect to behenji. This will turn all the farmland of Uttar Pradesh into areas worth attention and protection by the local administration and government machinery.

“All these statues should be washed daily, which could also help us in irrigation of our farms. There should be all round protection of these statues; the policemen present would make sure that criminals don’t run away with our had-earned produces.” Kishan explained why having Mayawati statues as scarecrows could help the farmers a great deal.

But it seems the state administration has taken umbrage at the act and deemed it disrespectful to equate Mayawati with a scarecrow, and therefore completely missing the novel idea of Kishan Ram.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/honey-bees-request-to-keep-them-out-of-the-political-bullshit-723,"Lucknow. A group claiming to represent common honeybees in India has requested media and the civil society not to drag their community in the ongoing political bullshit over appearance of a swarm of bees during a political rally. The swarm was seen near the podium where Chief Minister of an Indian state was addressing her party workers this Monday. Later, appearance of the bees was deemed as a political conspiracy.

“We sincerely request the human beings and their institutions not to drag honeybees in the whole controversy. Our daily lives are governed by the question of existence and not some political bullshit.” said Madhu the honeybee, chairman of Bee Safekeeping Party (BSP).

The white spots seen in the picture above are honeybees, which has created a political controversy in the country

Madhu said that initially BSP members laughed off the matter, but were forced to issue a statement after they learnt that an FIR was filed in the case.

“We have seen no FIRs being registered even when people were killed in broad daylight and school going girls being raped, but you guys are quite serious this time, isn’t it?” Madhu asked as well as wondered.

Although Madhu insisted that the society of honeybees was apolitical in nature, she couldn’t stop herself from smelling a conspiracy in the whole episode. She personally believed that there was more than what met the bees’ eyes.

“What is making you guys so interested in bees? I just heard you had some sugar shortage in your country. I guess you guys are eyeing our honey now. This talk of conspiracy by one party against other is all hogwash. Ultimately all your political parties aim to team up to plunder some resources.” Madhu said with a hint of cynicism towards the political leaders of the human beings.

Madhu and other members of the BSP have also expressed fears that some members of their society could be illegally detained for questioning in this matter, now that an FIR has been filed. BSP made it clear that they had no idea who could be behind the incident (who lit the fire that disturbed the beehive).

“Dude, we were running for our life; and we have been running like this for ages since you guys discovered fire and thought you discovered civilization. We have no idea. Please keep us out of this.” Madhu requested again.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/maya-bee-attack-250x172.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/honey-bees-request-to-keep-them-out-of-the-political-bullshit-723,Honey Bees request to keep them out of the political bullshit,,1268921121.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-cant-understand-what-so-big-deal-about-spending-huge-cash-is-719,"Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati has expressed utter puzzlement over the widespread criticism of the 200-crore party organized in the city yesterday to mark the 25th anniversary of BSP, her political party, and its founder Kanshi Ram’s birthday. She has termed such criticisms as ‘ridiculous’ and a result of manuwadi mentality. Mayawati was speaking exclusively to Faking News, where she staunchly defended her policies.

Following are the highlights of the interview with Behenji Mayawati:

Faking News (FN): Thanks Behenji for taking time out for talking to us. Let’s straightaway come to the celebrations that apparently cost rupees 200 crore! Do you think it was justified?

Behenji Mayawati (BM): I am also unhappy about it and have ordered an inquiry. It’s illogical you see; it should have been 250 crore as it was the 25th anniversary of our party.

FN: Oops! So you think spending 200 crore rupees was not such a big deal?

BM: Are you nuts or manuwadi? Lakhs of crore rupees are budgeted for non-planned expenditure by governments; one can organize dozens of such celebrations each day!

FN: But Uttar Pradesh is a poor state.

BM: Dude, whole of India is full of poor people. Does that mean no celebrations? Why organize events like IPL when so many cricket fans can’t afford two meals a day?

FN: So, you think such parties are like IPL to people living below poverty line? Do we have a new definition of BPL – Bahujan Premier League? (smiles)

BM: One more such PJ and you would be booked under the SC/ST act.

FN: We are sorry, it was just a joke. But are comparisons with IPL fair? IPL gives employment to so many people, while your parties are deemed to be just a waste of money.

BM: Of course comparisons with IPL are not fair. We don’t give money to foreigners for dancing. Right from the guy making statues to the person driving buses to bring people to rallies – all these guys get employment and they are local people in need of money. Only a fool will call it a waste of money.

FN: You seem to be quite interested in IPL, which team do you support?

BM: I don’t care man. I might support the team I intend to buy next year – Kanpur Behenji Champions (KBC). Also, I like that Lalit (Modi) dude. His name rhymes with Dalit (laughs). Jokes apart, he is a smart guy. You see, BCCI doesn’t pay tax as it is deemed as conducting ‘charity’ through IPL. I too want that my parties and park-building activities are recognized as charity work.

Mayawati being garlanded by currency notes. Some people thought it was cool, some thought it was uncool

FN: Coming back to your party, there is huge furor over garland of currency notes that was presented to you. Do you think it was a shameless display of money?

BM: Can you tell me how a proper display of money is done?

FN: Say, a large bank cheque presented to you?

BM: And why is that proper? Because that’s the way cricketers are presented money at the end of the match? Dude, very soon even Man of the Match money would be awarded the way I was awarded money by my supporters. There is nothing proper or improper in display of money.

FN: So you think that the money was an award for you?

BM: Yes, for my good work done for the poor people.

FN: Good work done? Like?

BM: Dude, I had warned you earlier not to crack PJs, right?

FN: Oh sorry! It won’t happen again, I promise. But why should you accept money from poor people, even as an award?

BM: First go ask this question to your Rahul Baba. Why does he eat at homes of poor people, who can’t afford to feed their own family? Does he realize how much trouble those families have to go to recover the cost of his food once he leaves after consuming their stock? If I accept money from poor people, I provide them free food as well in the rallies.

FN: Let us get it straight. Are you not trying to mobilize dalit votes to counter Rahul Baba by conducting such parties?

BM: That’s bullshit.

FN: One last question. Did you really not feel afraid, even for a second, when those bees were swarming near you?

BM: I would have been if the garland was made of flowers, for bees are attracted to flowers. But my party workers could somehow sense this manuwadi conspiracy and hence presented me a garland of currency notes instead. You know, that’s why these manuwadis are so unhappy about the garland; their designs failed.

Faking News: That’s really smart of you and your men. Thanks Behenji for the interview. It was a pleasure talking to you.

Behenji Mayawati: Same here. I like journalists like you.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/maywati-215x249.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-cant-understand-what-so-big-deal-about-spending-huge-cash-is-719,Mayawati justifies spending huge cash and display of wealth,,1268733911.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/womens-reservation-bill-passed-with-quota-for-men-within-it-700,"New Delhi. In a historical decision announced on the occasion of International Women’s Day, Indian parliament today unanimously passed the long-pending Women’s Reservation Bill, clearing the deck for 33% reservation for women in parliamentary and assembly seats. To secure support from all parties, a little modification was brought into the bill – there would be now 80% quota within this quota for men i.e. human-beings with masculine features.

“This is one small step for a woman, but a giant leap for the mankind,” said a visibly satisfied Lalu Prasad Yadav, who has been one of the most virulent critics of the bill in its pristine form and have been demanding a quota within quota for the socially disadvantaged groups.

Lalu Prasad Yadav and other leaders opposing the bill were quite cool with no quota for OBC, Muslims, and Dalits being provisioned in the changed bill.

“Men from these disadvantaged communities are capable enough to contest and win when pitched against men or women from different communities, we only doubted the capabilities of our women,” said an outspoken Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose daughter-in-law was defeated in a by-election last November.

Women MPs celebrating the passage of Women’s Reservation Bill by the parliament

Apart from these original opponents of the bill, many other members too expressed happiness after this quota within quota for men was introduced within the bill.

“Honestly, the bill makes more sense now,” said a Congress MP, with a smile.

But women rights groups have expressed outrage over the modification, claiming that the change had executed the soul of the bill. These groups are planning to move to the Supreme Court of India to get the law struck down on grounds of being unconstitutional.

“In essence, now they have debarred women from contesting 27% of the total seats, what crap is this?” protested Aarushi, a woman rights activist, swearing to fight a long drawn battle to get the bill restored and passed in its original form.

Interestingly, one of the legal recourses being considered by some of these activists is to interpret the definition of ‘men’ in the changed bill.

“Since they have defined men as human beings with masculine features, we could argue that women with masculine features qualify for the reservation. And perhaps that’s what is needed. Women need to adopt some masculine features like aggression and violence, if they are to be taken seriously for political participation,” postulated Rakhi Sawant, a leading feminist and lawyer.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/women_power.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/womens-reservation-bill-passed-with-quota-for-men-within-it-700,Women’s Reservation Bill passed with quota for Men within it,,1268035779.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/duryodhana-returns-claims-rights-on-the-throne-of-delhi-684,"New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might be confident of surviving the protests from the opposition and his own allies over the issue of price-rise, but he surely has no idea how to deal with this. Yuvraaj Duryodhana, the quintessential villain of Mahabharata, has made a comeback and has claimed that the throne of Delhi was rightfully his. Duryodhana has also approached Delhi High Court in this regard.

“I was the Prince of Hastinapur and Pandavas defeated me by deceit. They also spread false rumors about mine and my anuj (younger brother) Duhshashan’s death. Whereas we had just gone on a self-imposed exile after being defeated in the war of Kurukshetra,” said Duryodhana during an exclusive chit-chat with Faking News, arguing that since no one from the Pandavas clan seemed to be interested anymore in laying a claim to the throne, he was duty bound to come out of his self-imposed exile.

Duryodhana denied any possibility of forming a political party and fighting elections to get back the Delhi throne. He argued that since no one, duly authorized by either the Pandavas or the Kauravas clan, ever signed the instrument of accession document offered by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the Republic of India, he had a legitimate claim over Delhi.

Duryodhana is all set to be back in limelight

But experts believe that this argument by the Kaurava prince could actually save the central UPA government, although endangering the Delhi state government of Sheila Dixit in the process.

“Clearly, Duryodhana is talking about Hastinapur only, which is now the National Capital Region of Delhi. At best, NCR could get a special status like Jammu & Kashmir and Duryodhana could be allowed to rule with autonomy,” said Owais Abdullah, a legal and constitutional expert.

As expected, Duryodhana is not happy with what is being offered. “What nonsense! Even Krishna had tried to offer me something similar, and you know what followed. Don’t give me that shit again!” Duryodhana declared amid loud noise of thunder, lightning and rain-showers.

Duryodhana also expressed displeasure and anguish over the poor condition of his ancestral property and vowed to erect more palaces when he gets his throne back. Surprisingly, he expressed support for Ambedkar Parks being constructed by the Uttar Pradesh government in the region.

“I love elephants. All of you must be knowing that I possess power of 70 elephants like my bête noir Bheema. I’m okay with these projects,” announced Duryodhana, who claimed that he had clear thoughts on a lot of issues ranging from poverty, inflation, agriculture and global warming, for which he would seek help from his good friend Karna, son of Surya (sun god).

Delhi High Court is yet to accept or reject the petition by Duryodhana, but voices in support of him are already being heard. Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has expressed interest in joining him if the Rajput prince changed his mind and decided to float a political party.

Digvijay Singh too is expected to support the initiative.

“I will try my best to convince Yuvraaj Duryodhana to join politics. I believe he would be an asset to the Indian politics. We could also take Behen Mayawati along if he desires so,” said Amar Singh, who felt that Duryodhana didn’t have much of political options as BJP was not interested in anti-Ram or anti-Krishna people, and Communist parties would reject him as fraud imperialist, while Congress had their own in-house Yuvraaj.

“I would go and join the casino of anuj Duhshashan in Las Vegas, rather than joining politics here,” Duryodhana said, once again denying the possibility of him forming a political party.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/west-bengal-demands-10-percent-reservation-for-bengalis-630,"Kolkata. Left Front government in the West Bengal has demanded 10% blanket reservation for Bengalis all over India. The demand was raised in a press conference organized by Chief Minister and CPM leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who along with his party, believes that West Bengal has become a backward and poor state in the last 33 years, and Bengalis now needed reservation in all government and private jobs and educational institutes.

“The data speaks for itself. West Bengal has lost on almost all development indices and parameters in the recent years. State is even trailing behind its neighbor Bihar in GDP growth as well as in being the favored destination by the industries for investment. All reports indicate that West Bengal is fast becoming a backward state.” Chief Minister made a strong pitch for reservations.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee signals after announcing reservations for Bengalis

CPM, the leading partner of the Left Front government in the state, also demanded that a fresh census should be carried out to find out how many Bengalis were recruited by the various state governments and private companies in the recent years.

“There is a clear bias against Bengalis among industries and the other states. Bengalis used to be a prosperous and jobful (sic.) community in Bihar and Orissa for decades, but not any more. We have a report that clearly points out that Bengalis have been discriminated against by various companies. The report recommends 10% reservation for Bengalis all over India.” Buddhadeb distributed a handout containing recommendations of a certain Rangeela Commission among the journalists.

The West Bengal government, especially the CPM, has suggested that all Bengalis be declared as OBC in light of these findings and should be provided the benefits of the reservations. But legal experts believe that the demands of the West Bengal government might be untenable and open a can of worms.

“Did anyone ask the Bengalis what they wanted? And this could give ideas to other political parties looking to win elections. Did I say Maharashtra?” Abhash Kashyap, a legal expert expressed his concerns.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/buddhadeb-250x192.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/west-bengal-demands-10-percent-reservation-for-bengalis-630,West Bengal demands 10 percent reservation for Bengalis,,1265648127.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-pocket-picked-while-traveling-in-local-train-622,"Mumbai. The intrepid act of traveling in a local train like a common man might have won laurels for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi by the media, but it seems that it cost him a few thousand bucks. According to well placed sources in the first class coach of Andheri-Dadar local, some unidentified assailants picked Rahul Gandhi’s pocket that contained cash, credit cards, his Congress identity-card, PAN card, and keys of his official residence.

“Rahulji realized this when he decided to treat the dalit children living in the Ghatkopar slum with some paani puri. He found his wallet missing when he reached out for it. This is a serious security lapse and we have directed the Mumbai police to nab the culprit.” said Ramesh Bagwe, Minister of State for Home in Maharashtra, who was dejected that he couldn’t notice Rahul’s missing wallet as he was busy carrying Rahul’s slippers (chappals).

Security experts believe that just like he makes last minute changes to his travel route, Rahul Gandhi should also change his clothes so that pickpockets are not sure where his pocket was.

State Congress officials believe that Shiv Sena members were behind the incident, and have asked for a ban on the political party for indulging in such anti-national acts. While Shiv Sena has not reacted to the charges yet, some experts believe that Sena couldn’t be blamed for the incident.

“Shiv Sena had no idea of the train journey so it’s highly unlikely that they could have carried out this deed. I believe it was done by some professional pickpockets’ group, aided unfortunately by the news channels’ continuous and live reporting of Rahul Gandhi’s Mumbai visit. They reported live that Rahul had withdrawn cash from an ATM, and it might have alerted these pickpockets.” British Kandy, a sociologist and media expert opined.

Rahul Gandhi will now have to get his credit cards blocked, change the lock of his official residence and apply for a duplicate PAN card and identity cards of Congress party after this unfortunate incident. His office bearers have expressed confidence that all of these would be done within minutes, but the incident has surely exposed how vulnerable a common Mumbaikar was in the city.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/rahul_gandhi-250x208.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-pocket-picked-while-traveling-in-local-train-622,Rahul Gandhi’s pocket picked while traveling in local train,,1265367266.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

At least 57 persons were hospitalized with symptoms like nausea, headache and vomiting after they attended a meeting where MNS chief Raj Thackeray delivered a speech on development of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Most of the victims have been discharged after primary treatment but condition of 13 of them continues to be delicate, although doctors have declared them out of danger. Doctors consider it a case of “speech poisoning”.

“We took samples of water and food that was presented to these guys and also toured the venue where the meeting took place. After laboratory tests, no contamination was found in the food and water samples and the air too was found to be clean and healthy. This seems to be a case of a disease that is spread by viruses and parasites that are speechborne.” Dr. Potdukhe, who treated most of the sick people at Bombay Hospital, said.

Raj Thackeray is seen here reacting when he saw a few present men and women falling unconscious as he delivered his speech

Most of the people, who fell sick during the meeting where the speech was delivered, confirm that they had started feeling dizzy even without having any food or water, giving credence to the prognosis done by Dr. Potdukhe.

“Things were going alright but soon I started feeling as if there was darkness all around. The appearances of people around me started getting blurred and they appeared like half naked warriors of Salman Khan’s Veer to me. For a moment I even thought that they were shouting Pindari Pindari like the Veer warriors, but I believe they were actually yelling Bihari Bihari.” Viru Waghmare, one of the guys who fell unconscious during Raj Thackeray’s speech, said.

Many others who attended and consumed the speech had similar stories to tell, although a bulk of people didn’t complain of any such problems. Doctors believe that the virus has mutated itself and has stealthily found its way into the immune system of many persons, causing them not to fall ill.

“This is a very complex kind of parasite or virus we are dealing with here. I believe that it has mutated itself several times now and might even masquerade as antibodies, which may cause some people to believe that they are alright, even though they might actually be sick.” Dr. Potdukhe cautioned people against being complacent, and asked them to see a doctor soon.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Raj_Thackeray-250x205.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dozens-fall-sick-after-attending-a-speech-by-raj-thackeray-614,Dozens fall sick after attending a speech by Raj Thackeray,,1265109252.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Chidambaram, who believes that sporting relations with Pakistan should not suffer due to diplomatic problems, is all set to play Frisbee with his Pakistani counterpart Rehman Malik in Islamabad on the sidelines of the SAARC Interior Ministers’ conference. The game of Frisbee, which could tentatively take place on 21st February, is being projected as a CBM (Confidence Building Measure) to boost Indo-Pak relations.

The decision to play Frisbee was taken unilaterally by the Indian Home Minister, but Mr. Chidambaram is hopeful that his Pakistani counterpart will reciprocate the grand gesture. Home Minister announced the decision in a press conference here, where he also showed the special Frisbee disc he would be carrying to the SAARC conference.

“This ordinary looking disc stores the desires of several million Indians who want to have better relations with Pakistan.” said Chidambaram as he held out the Frisbee disc towards the journalists. Before journalists of a particular media group could term the disc as a part of aman ki asha, Chidambaram was quick to give a new term to his initiative – flight of hope.

Furthermore, Chidambaram clarified that he would be playing Frisbee with Rehman Malik in a personal capacity and not as the Indian Home Minister.

“Let’s not confuse sports with diplomacy and individuals with countries.” Chidambaram defended his decision to play Frisbee amid reports that Pakistan was dragging its feet on the Mumbai terror attacks trial.

There was no reaction from Pakistan on the announcement by Mr. Chidambaram, but unconfirmed reports suggest that the Pakistan based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had placed order for more than 50 Frisbee discs. It’s not yet known what does LeT intend to do with these discs.

Meanwhile BJP, the widely believed opposition party at the center, has questioned the wisdom of the minister and the government behind such moves.

“What if Rehman Malik gives a snub to the Frisbee offer? What if Chidambaram loses the match? Home Minister is giving Pakistan a golden opportunity to settle scores with us after the IPL snub.” BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, questioning the Home Minister’s judgment.

Ravi Shankar Prasad pointed out that Chidambaram had winced and cringed back when a shoe was deliberately thrown off target at his press conference last year by a journalist called Jarnail Singh.

“He had completely misread the line of flight of Jarnail Singh’s shoe. How can he catch a Frisbee disc that moves so wobbly in the air? Clearly, Chidambaram is not the best of the Frisbee players in the country.” Ravi Shankar Prasad expressed his concerns.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Friendly_Chidambaram-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-to-play-frisbee-with-rehman-malik-to-boost-bilateral-ties-604,Chidambaram to play Frisbee with Rehman Malik to boost bilateral ties,,1264712408.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Stung by the criticism that it asked CBI to go slow on corruption cases against some of the opposition leaders to secure their support in the parliament, UPA government has decided to put CBI blimps everywhere in the country to underscore the assertion that it was a free body driven by its own free will. These blimps would not be chained and would be freely floating in all the leading cities of India.

“There have been misleading media reports that suggest that the government had struck a deal with likes of Lalu Yadav, Mayawati or A Raja to let them get away with CBI probe in lieu of their respective parties’ support to the government. This is all baseless and malicious. We want to send out a message that CBI was an independent body.” Information and Broadcasting Minister Ms. Ambika Soni said.

CBI blimps would soon be seen in the skies

Announcing the decision at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium here, Ms. Soni also released the maiden CBI blimp on the occasion. The blimp went up high in the air and kept hovering over the stadium for the whole duration of the press conference, attracting jibes from the journalists present.

“Madam, there is no activity or motion at all. Is that how CBI functions?” asked independent journalist Jarnail Singh, who had flung shoes at P Chidambaram last year to protest CBI’s clean chit to politicians accused of leading anti-Sikh riots.

Ms. Soni tried to justify the behavior of blimp by claiming that it was keeping an eye over the stadium that hosted a few IPL matches as IPL scam was on the top of the agenda of the government as of now.

“Please be patient and allow us to put more blimps in other cities. You’d get your answers and people would know that the CBI is on move.” Ms. Soni said.

Government has expressed confidence that the move will reiterate and emphasize CBI’s contribution towards making of a corruption-free India in the same way as MRF blimps underscored the contribution of MRF Pace Foundation to Indian cricket. But a few marketing experts differ.

“MRF is in business of making tyres, which are hollow from inside, so a blimp went well with their positioning. But an investigation agency is not expected to be hollow! It should have a strong internal structure and its motion must not be influenced just by hot airs. I’m not sure if this will send out a right message.” Aulad Kakkar, a marketing guru said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/blimp-250x200.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/government-planning-to-put-cbi-blimps-everywhere-in-the-country-815,Government planning to put CBI blimps everywhere in the country,,1272441053.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/first-time-mp-alleges-ragging-by-seniors-inside-parliament-premises-128,"New Delhi. Twenty eight years old Dheer Gambhir (not his original name), a first time MP who won as an independent candidate in the last general elections, has accused some senior MPs of ragging him for over a month inside the parliament premises.

This is the first reported incident of ragging inside the parliament and it has shocked everyone beyond belief. Gambhir has leveled serious allegations against many senior Lok Sabha MPs belonging to various national and regional parties.

What’s going on inside?

“They would ask me to do really absurd stuff and claim that it would only prepare me better to take part in the parliamentary proceedings. Once they asked me to sit on a boiled egg and break it into various parts without touching it with my hands. When I somehow did that, they asked me to measure the length of all the broken parts, saying it would complete the ‘divide and rule’ lesson. It was disgusting,” Gambhir alleged.

Gambhir further alleged that other first time MPs were also subjected to such horrifying and sadistic treatment by older MPs. His most shocking revelation was the claim that older MPs also ordered the younger MPs to perform acts that were obscene and amounted to sexual harassment.

“Once they applied sugar syrup all over my body and asked my fellow first timer to lick it. The other MP was also a man (sic.) and I didn’t enjoy this gay licking at all. They made us go through this horrible stuff after we had asked a question in Zero Hour related to continual export of sugar by India even though our domestic stocks were depleting. Apparently none of them thought the question made any sense,” Gambhir leveled further horrifying allegations.

The senior MPs, cutting across party lines, have termed the allegations of Gambhir as baseless and have accused him of being mentally deranged.

But Gambhir has already lodged a police complaint in this regard against thirteen MPs aged between 55 and 75 years, belonging to different parties. Faking News has decided not to print the names of these MPs until the case comes out open in the public domain once the courts or the police take some action. That might take some time as Delhi police is clueless over the next logical step in the case and are planning to meet the Speaker of Lok Sabha tomorrow to seek guidance.

“It’s a very complicated case. Supreme Court had outlawed ragging but that was for educational institutes. Although parliament resembles a college with rowdy students, technically it’s not an educational institute. Then you have these privileges enjoyed by parliamentarians that safeguard them against any punitive action. Delhi police would need some legal opinion before proceeding,” a noted lawyer and constitutional expert told Faking News, handing out his business card.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/parliament-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/first-time-mp-alleges-ragging-by-seniors-inside-parliament-premises-128,First time MP alleges ragging by seniors inside Parliament premises,,1271515806.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

The move comes close to the immaculate observation by the party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, who envisioned whistles going left and right in the parliament once Women’s Reservation Bill was passed.

“There is a large percentage of young men who drop jaws when they see chick looking girls, many of whom work in these corporate houses. These young men can’t help but to gawk at these girls and in the process are branded uncultured and unfit for a healthy work atmosphere. This is a clear case of social discrimination.” party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhry said.

Some people think that women working in corporate are devious and make helpless and honest guys whistle at them

Samajwadi Party has demanded that since these whistleblowers (sic) find it tough to crack private job interviews, as they keep on looking at the good looking female HR executives, there should be reservation for such guys in all the private sector jobs. Party has demanded 33% reservation for such guys.

“These women have been dressing up smart and sexy for long and making these poor guys uncomfortable. We could as well have asked for a ban on such women for taking away rights of these unfortunate whistleblowers, but we believe in social justice and there is nothing better way to achieve equality than reservations.” Chaudhry said.

The demand by the party has received mixed reactions from various quarters with corporate India almost unanimous in condemning the idea. Legal experts were divided over the constitutional validity of the demand and pointed out that identification and listing of such whistleblowers might not be an easy job, but a few social scientists have termed the demand worth a deliberation.

“The society has to shed the elitist mentality and dispassionately analyse the issue. If we can have people in the parliament who can whistle at women, what’s wrong if they are given jobs?” argued Rajendra Raju, a thinker.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bipasha_basu-236x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/sp-asks-for-reservation-in-private-sector-jobs-for-youth-whistling-at-women-751,SP asks for reservation in private sector jobs for youth whistling at women,,1269699621.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-farmer-puts-up-mayawati-statues-as-scarecrow-jailed-749,"Ballia, Uttar Pradesh. A local farmer has been jailed for putting up a statue of Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati as a scarecrow (human shaped effigy put up to scare away birds from eating grains and other farm produces) in his farm. The act of the farmer has been deemed as one creating public disorder and damage to the state property, but the farmer has termed it as an ingenious attempt to improve his agricultural yield.

“I have no intentions to disrespect behenji. My act has been misinterpreted.” pleaded Kishan Ram, currently locked up in the local police station. Kishan said that by putting up Mayawati’s statue in his field, he was making sure that the local administration paid full attention to the area, which happened to be his farm.

Mayawati statue put up as scarecrow in the farm by Kishan. (Inset: a normal scarecrow)

Kishan further informed that he got the idea after reading a news report where it was mentioned that Mayawati spent more on statues than on farmers of Uttar Pradesh.

“It’s foolish to expect that behenji would stop spending on statues. Instead, we should try to come up with ideas that could benefit statues as well as other items such as agriculture.” Kishan explained his rationale, and denied that he had any feelings of malice towards the Chief Minister.

Kishan believes that all the farmers should follow suit and put up life-size statues of Mayawati in their farms after paying full respect to behenji. This will turn all the farmland of Uttar Pradesh into areas worth attention and protection by the local administration and government machinery.

“All these statues should be washed daily, which could also help us in irrigation of our farms. There should be all round protection of these statues; the policemen present would make sure that criminals don’t run away with our had-earned produces.” Kishan explained why having Mayawati statues as scarecrows could help the farmers a great deal.

But it seems the state administration has taken umbrage at the act and deemed it disrespectful to equate Mayawati with a scarecrow, and therefore completely missing the novel idea of Kishan Ram. Faking News appeals to the Uttar Pradesh government to rethink their decision and officially put statues of behenji in all the farms of Uttar Pradesh.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/scarecrow.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/up-farmer-puts-up-mayawati-statues-as-scarecrow-jailed-749,"UP farmer puts up Mayawati statues as scarecrow, jailed",,1269611757.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

A group claiming to represent common honeybees in India has requested media and the civil society not to drag their community in the ongoing political bullshit over appearance of a swarm of bees during a political rally. The swarm was seen near the podium where Chief Minister of an Indian state was addressing her party workers this Monday. Later, appearance of the bees was deemed as a political conspiracy.

“We sincerely request the human beings and their institutions not to drag honeybees in the whole controversy. Our daily lives are governed by the question of existence and not some political bullshit.” said Madhu the honeybee, chairman of Bee Safekeeping Party (BSP).

The white spots seen in the picture above are honeybees, which has created a political controversy in the country

Madhu said that initially BSP members laughed off the matter, but were forced to issue a statement after they learnt that an FIR was filed in the case.

“We have seen no FIRs being registered even when people were killed in broad daylight and school going girls being raped, but you guys are quite serious this time, isn’t it?” Madhu asked as well as wondered.

Although Madhu insisted that the society of honeybees was apolitical in nature, she couldn’t stop herself from smelling a conspiracy in the whole episode. She personally believed that there was more than what met the bees’ eyes.

“What is making you guys so interested in bees? I just heard you had some sugar shortage in your country. I guess you guys are eyeing our honey now. This talk of conspiracy by one party against other is all hogwash. Ultimately all your political parties aim to team up to plunder some resources.” Madhu said with a hint of cynicism towards the political leaders of the human beings.

Madhu and other members of the BSP have also expressed fears that some members of their society could be illegally detained for questioning in this matter, now that an FIR has been filed. BSP made it clear that they had no idea who could be behind the incident (who lit the fire that disturbed the beehive).

“Dude, we were running for our life; and we have been running like this for ages since you guys discovered fire and thought you discovered civilization. We have no idea. Please keep us out of this.” Madhu requested again.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/maya-bee-attack-250x172.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/honey-bees-request-to-keep-them-out-of-the-political-bullshit-723,Honey Bees request to keep them out of the political bullshit,,1268921121.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-cant-understand-what-so-big-deal-about-spending-huge-cash-is-719,"Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati has expressed utter puzzlement over the widespread criticism of the 200-crore party organized in the city yesterday to mark the 25th anniversary of BSP, her political party, and its founder Kanshi Ram’s birthday. She has termed such criticisms as ‘ridiculous’ and a result of manuwadi mentality. Mayawati was speaking exclusively to Faking News, where she staunchly defended her policies.

Following are the highlights of the interview with Behenji Mayawati:

Faking News (FN): Thanks Behenji for taking time out for talking to us. Let’s straightaway come to the celebrations that apparently cost rupees 200 crore! Do you think it was justified?

Behenji Mayawati (BM): I am also unhappy about it and have ordered an inquiry. It’s illogical you see; it should have been 250 crore as it was the 25th anniversary of our party.

FN: Oops! So you think spending 200 crore rupees was not such a big deal?

BM: Are you nuts or manuwadi? Lakhs of crore rupees are budgeted for non-planned expenditure by governments; one can organize dozens of such celebrations each day!

FN: But Uttar Pradesh is a poor state.

BM: Dude, whole of India is full of poor people. Does that mean no celebrations? Why organize events like IPL when so many cricket fans can’t afford two meals a day?

FN: So, you think such parties are like IPL to people living below poverty line? Do we have a new definition of BPL – Bahujan Premier League? (smiles)

BM: One more such PJ and you would be booked under the SC/ST act.

FN: We are sorry, it was just a joke. But are comparisons with IPL fair? IPL gives employment to so many people, while your parties are deemed to be just a waste of money.

BM: Of course comparisons with IPL are not fair. We don’t give money to foreigners for dancing. Right from the guy making statues to the person driving buses to bring people to rallies – all these guys get employment and they are local people in need of money. Only a fool will call it a waste of money.

FN: You seem to be quite interested in IPL, which team do you support?

BM: I don’t care man. I might support the team I intend to buy next year – Kanpur Behenji Champions (KBC). Also, I like that Lalit (Modi) dude. His name rhymes with Dalit (laughs). Jokes apart, he is a smart guy. You see, BCCI doesn’t pay tax as it is deemed as conducting ‘charity’ through IPL. I too want that my parties and park-building activities are recognized as charity work.

Mayawati being garlanded by currency notes. Some people thought it was cool, some thought it was uncool

FN: Coming back to your party, there is huge furor over garland of currency notes that was presented to you. Do you think it was a shameless display of money?

BM: Can you tell me how a proper display of money is done?

FN: Say, a large bank cheque presented to you?

BM: And why is that proper? Because that’s the way cricketers are presented money at the end of the match? Dude, very soon even Man of the Match money would be awarded the way I was awarded money by my supporters. There is nothing proper or improper in display of money.

FN: So you think that the money was an award for you?

BM: Yes, for my good work done for the poor people.

FN: Good work done? Like?

BM: Dude, I had warned you earlier not to crack PJs, right?

FN: Oh sorry! It won’t happen again, I promise. But why should you accept money from poor people, even as an award?

BM: First go ask this question to your Rahul Baba. Why does he eat at homes of poor people, who can’t afford to feed their own family? Does he realize how much trouble those families have to go to recover the cost of his food once he leaves after consuming their stock? If I accept money from poor people, I provide them free food as well in the rallies.

FN: Let us get it straight. Are you not trying to mobilize dalit votes to counter Rahul Baba by conducting such parties?

BM: That’s bullshit.

FN: One last question. Did you really not feel afraid, even for a second, when those bees were swarming near you?

BM: I would have been if the garland was made of flowers, for bees are attracted to flowers. But my party workers could somehow sense this manuwadi conspiracy and hence presented me a garland of currency notes instead. You know, that’s why these manuwadis are so unhappy about the garland; their designs failed.

Faking News: That’s really smart of you and your men. Thanks Behenji for the interview. It was a pleasure talking to you.

Behenji Mayawati: Same here. I like journalists like you.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/maywati-215x249.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-cant-understand-what-so-big-deal-about-spending-huge-cash-is-719,Mayawati justifies spending huge cash and display of wealth,,1268733911.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/womens-reservation-bill-passed-with-quota-for-men-within-it-700,"New Delhi. In a historical decision announced on the occasion of International Women’s Day, Indian parliament today unanimously passed the long-pending Women’s Reservation Bill, clearing the deck for 33% reservation for women in parliamentary and assembly seats. To secure support from all parties, a little modification was brought into the bill – there would be now 80% quota within this quota for men i.e. human-beings with masculine features.

“This is one small step for a woman, but a giant leap for the mankind,” said a visibly satisfied Lalu Prasad Yadav, who has been one of the most virulent critics of the bill in its pristine form and have been demanding a quota within quota for the socially disadvantaged groups.

Lalu Prasad Yadav and other leaders opposing the bill were quite cool with no quota for OBC, Muslims, and Dalits being provisioned in the changed bill.

“Men from these disadvantaged communities are capable enough to contest and win when pitched against men or women from different communities, we only doubted the capabilities of our women,” said an outspoken Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose daughter-in-law was defeated in a by-election last November.

Women MPs celebrating the passage of Women’s Reservation Bill by the parliament

Apart from these original opponents of the bill, many other members too expressed happiness after this quota within quota for men was introduced within the bill.

“Honestly, the bill makes more sense now,” said a Congress MP, with a smile.

But women rights groups have expressed outrage over the modification, claiming that the change had executed the soul of the bill. These groups are planning to move to the Supreme Court of India to get the law struck down on grounds of being unconstitutional.

“In essence, now they have debarred women from contesting 27% of the total seats, what crap is this?” protested Aarushi, a woman rights activist, swearing to fight a long drawn battle to get the bill restored and passed in its original form.

Interestingly, one of the legal recourses being considered by some of these activists is to interpret the definition of ‘men’ in the changed bill.

“Since they have defined men as human beings with masculine features, we could argue that women with masculine features qualify for the reservation. And perhaps that’s what is needed. Women need to adopt some masculine features like aggression and violence, if they are to be taken seriously for political participation,” postulated Rakhi Sawant, a leading feminist and lawyer.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/women_power.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/womens-reservation-bill-passed-with-quota-for-men-within-it-700,Women’s Reservation Bill passed with quota for Men within it,,1268035779.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/duryodhana-returns-claims-rights-on-the-throne-of-delhi-684,"New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might be confident of surviving the protests from the opposition and his own allies over the issue of price-rise, but he surely has no idea how to deal with this. Yuvraaj Duryodhana, the quintessential villain of Mahabharata, has made a comeback and has claimed that the throne of Delhi was rightfully his. Duryodhana has also approached Delhi High Court in this regard.

“I was the Prince of Hastinapur and Pandavas defeated me by deceit. They also spread false rumors about mine and my anuj (younger brother) Duhshashan’s death. Whereas we had just gone on a self-imposed exile after being defeated in the war of Kurukshetra,” said Duryodhana during an exclusive chit-chat with Faking News, arguing that since no one from the Pandavas clan seemed to be interested anymore in laying a claim to the throne, he was duty bound to come out of his self-imposed exile.

Duryodhana denied any possibility of forming a political party and fighting elections to get back the Delhi throne. He argued that since no one, duly authorized by either the Pandavas or the Kauravas clan, ever signed the instrument of accession document offered by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the Republic of India, he had a legitimate claim over Delhi.

Duryodhana is all set to be back in limelight

But experts believe that this argument by the Kaurava prince could actually save the central UPA government, although endangering the Delhi state government of Sheila Dixit in the process.

“Clearly, Duryodhana is talking about Hastinapur only, which is now the National Capital Region of Delhi. At best, NCR could get a special status like Jammu & Kashmir and Duryodhana could be allowed to rule with autonomy,” said Owais Abdullah, a legal and constitutional expert.

As expected, Duryodhana is not happy with what is being offered. “What nonsense! Even Krishna had tried to offer me something similar, and you know what followed. Don’t give me that shit again!” Duryodhana declared amid loud noise of thunder, lightning and rain-showers.

Duryodhana also expressed displeasure and anguish over the poor condition of his ancestral property and vowed to erect more palaces when he gets his throne back. Surprisingly, he expressed support for Ambedkar Parks being constructed by the Uttar Pradesh government in the region.

“I love elephants. All of you must be knowing that I possess power of 70 elephants like my bête noir Bheema. I’m okay with these projects,” announced Duryodhana, who claimed that he had clear thoughts on a lot of issues ranging from poverty, inflation, agriculture and global warming, for which he would seek help from his good friend Karna, son of Surya (sun god).

Delhi High Court is yet to accept or reject the petition by Duryodhana, but voices in support of him are already being heard. Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has expressed interest in joining him if the Rajput prince changed his mind and decided to float a political party.

Digvijay Singh too is expected to support the initiative.

“I will try my best to convince Yuvraaj Duryodhana to join politics. I believe he would be an asset to the Indian politics. We could also take Behen Mayawati along if he desires so,” said Amar Singh, who felt that Duryodhana didn’t have much of political options as BJP was not interested in anti-Ram or anti-Krishna people, and Communist parties would reject him as fraud imperialist, while Congress had their own in-house Yuvraaj.

“I would go and join the casino of anuj Duhshashan in Las Vegas, rather than joining politics here,” Duryodhana said, once again denying the possibility of him forming a political party.

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/west-bengal-demands-10-percent-reservation-for-bengalis-630,"Kolkata. Left Front government in the West Bengal has demanded 10% blanket reservation for Bengalis all over India. The demand was raised in a press conference organized by Chief Minister and CPM leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who along with his party, believes that West Bengal has become a backward and poor state in the last 33 years, and Bengalis now needed reservation in all government and private jobs and educational institutes.

“The data speaks for itself. West Bengal has lost on almost all development indices and parameters in the recent years. State is even trailing behind its neighbor Bihar in GDP growth as well as in being the favored destination by the industries for investment. All reports indicate that West Bengal is fast becoming a backward state.” Chief Minister made a strong pitch for reservations.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee signals after announcing reservations for Bengalis

CPM, the leading partner of the Left Front government in the state, also demanded that a fresh census should be carried out to find out how many Bengalis were recruited by the various state governments and private companies in the recent years.

“There is a clear bias against Bengalis among industries and the other states. Bengalis used to be a prosperous and jobful (sic.) community in Bihar and Orissa for decades, but not any more. We have a report that clearly points out that Bengalis have been discriminated against by various companies. The report recommends 10% reservation for Bengalis all over India.” Buddhadeb distributed a handout containing recommendations of a certain Rangeela Commission among the journalists.

The West Bengal government, especially the CPM, has suggested that all Bengalis be declared as OBC in light of these findings and should be provided the benefits of the reservations. But legal experts believe that the demands of the West Bengal government might be untenable and open a can of worms.

“Did anyone ask the Bengalis what they wanted? And this could give ideas to other political parties looking to win elections. Did I say Maharashtra?” Abhash Kashyap, a legal expert expressed his concerns.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/buddhadeb-250x192.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/west-bengal-demands-10-percent-reservation-for-bengalis-630,West Bengal demands 10 percent reservation for Bengalis,,1265648127.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-pocket-picked-while-traveling-in-local-train-622,"Mumbai. The intrepid act of traveling in a local train like a common man might have won laurels for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi by the media, but it seems that it cost him a few thousand bucks. According to well placed sources in the first class coach of Andheri-Dadar local, some unidentified assailants picked Rahul Gandhi’s pocket that contained cash, credit cards, his Congress identity-card, PAN card, and keys of his official residence.

“Rahulji realized this when he decided to treat the dalit children living in the Ghatkopar slum with some paani puri. He found his wallet missing when he reached out for it. This is a serious security lapse and we have directed the Mumbai police to nab the culprit.” said Ramesh Bagwe, Minister of State for Home in Maharashtra, who was dejected that he couldn’t notice Rahul’s missing wallet as he was busy carrying Rahul’s slippers (chappals).

Security experts believe that just like he makes last minute changes to his travel route, Rahul Gandhi should also change his clothes so that pickpockets are not sure where his pocket was.

State Congress officials believe that Shiv Sena members were behind the incident, and have asked for a ban on the political party for indulging in such anti-national acts. While Shiv Sena has not reacted to the charges yet, some experts believe that Sena couldn’t be blamed for the incident.

“Shiv Sena had no idea of the train journey so it’s highly unlikely that they could have carried out this deed. I believe it was done by some professional pickpockets’ group, aided unfortunately by the news channels’ continuous and live reporting of Rahul Gandhi’s Mumbai visit. They reported live that Rahul had withdrawn cash from an ATM, and it might have alerted these pickpockets.” British Kandy, a sociologist and media expert opined.

Rahul Gandhi will now have to get his credit cards blocked, change the lock of his official residence and apply for a duplicate PAN card and identity cards of Congress party after this unfortunate incident. His office bearers have expressed confidence that all of these would be done within minutes, but the incident has surely exposed how vulnerable a common Mumbaikar was in the city.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/rahul_gandhi-250x208.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-pocket-picked-while-traveling-in-local-train-622,Rahul Gandhi’s pocket picked while traveling in local train,,1265367266.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Most of the victims have been discharged after primary treatment but condition of 13 of them continues to be delicate, although doctors have declared them out of danger. Doctors consider it a case of “speech poisoning”.

“We took samples of water and food that was presented to these guys and also toured the venue where the meeting took place. After laboratory tests, no contamination was found in the food and water samples and the air too was found to be clean and healthy. This seems to be a case of a disease that is spread by viruses and parasites that are speechborne.” Dr. Potdukhe, who treated most of the sick people at Bombay Hospital, said.

Most of the people, who fell sick during the meeting where the speech was delivered, confirm that they had started feeling dizzy even without having any food or water, giving credence to the prognosis done by Dr. Potdukhe.

“Things were going alright but soon I started feeling as if there was darkness all around. The appearances of people around me started getting blurred and they appeared like half naked warriors of Salman Khan’s Veer to me. For a moment I even thought that they were shouting Pindari Pindari like the Veer warriors, but I believe they were actually yelling Bihari Bihari.” Viru Waghmare, one of the guys who fell unconscious during Raj Thackeray’s speech, said.

Many others who attended and consumed the speech had similar stories to tell, although a bulk of people didn’t complain of any such problems. Doctors believe that the virus has mutated itself and has stealthily found its way into the immune system of many persons, causing them not to fall ill.

“This is a very complex kind of parasite or virus we are dealing with here. I believe that it has mutated itself several times now and might even masquerade as antibodies, which may cause some people to believe that they are alright, even though they might actually be sick.” Dr. Potdukhe cautioned people against being complacent, and asked them to see a doctor soon.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Raj_Thackeray-250x205.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/dozens-fall-sick-after-attending-a-speech-by-raj-thackeray-614,Dozens fall sick after attending a speech by Raj Thackeray,,1265109252.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Chidambaram, who believes that sporting relations with Pakistan should not suffer due to diplomatic problems, is all set to play Frisbee with his Pakistani counterpart Rehman Malik in Islamabad on the sidelines of the SAARC Interior Ministers’ conference. The game of Frisbee, which could tentatively take place on 21st February, is being projected as a CBM (Confidence Building Measure) to boost Indo-Pak relations.

The decision to play Frisbee was taken unilaterally by the Indian Home Minister, but Mr. Chidambaram is hopeful that his Pakistani counterpart will reciprocate the grand gesture. Home Minister announced the decision in a press conference here, where he also showed the special Frisbee disc he would be carrying to the SAARC conference.

“This ordinary looking disc stores the desires of several million Indians who want to have better relations with Pakistan.” said Chidambaram as he held out the Frisbee disc towards the journalists. Before journalists of a particular media group could term the disc as a part of aman ki asha, Chidambaram was quick to give a new term to his initiative – flight of hope.

Furthermore, Chidambaram clarified that he would be playing Frisbee with Rehman Malik in a personal capacity and not as the Indian Home Minister.

“Let’s not confuse sports with diplomacy and individuals with countries.” Chidambaram defended his decision to play Frisbee amid reports that Pakistan was dragging its feet on the Mumbai terror attacks trial.

There was no reaction from Pakistan on the announcement by Mr. Chidambaram, but unconfirmed reports suggest that the Pakistan based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had placed order for more than 50 Frisbee discs. It’s not yet known what does LeT intend to do with these discs.

Meanwhile BJP, the widely believed opposition party at the center, has questioned the wisdom of the minister and the government behind such moves.

“What if Rehman Malik gives a snub to the Frisbee offer? What if Chidambaram loses the match? Home Minister is giving Pakistan a golden opportunity to settle scores with us after the IPL snub.” BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, questioning the Home Minister’s judgment.

Ravi Shankar Prasad pointed out that Chidambaram had winced and cringed back when a shoe was deliberately thrown off target at his press conference last year by a journalist called Jarnail Singh.

“He had completely misread the line of flight of Jarnail Singh’s shoe. How can he catch a Frisbee disc that moves so wobbly in the air? Clearly, Chidambaram is not the best of the Frisbee players in the country.” Ravi Shankar Prasad expressed his concerns.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Friendly_Chidambaram-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-to-play-frisbee-with-rehman-malik-to-boost-bilateral-ties-604,Chidambaram to play Frisbee with Rehman Malik to boost bilateral ties,,1264712408.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/minister-of-state-has-now-finely-settled-into-doing-nothing-583,"New Delhi. Having been jobless for over eight months since the new UPA government took charge, some Ministers of State (MoS) are now scared at the mere thought of working. This aspect was brought to the fore when one such MoS agreed for a frank and honest interview with Faking News. The MoS claimed that he had nicely settled into doing nothing and it would be virtually impossible for him to change gears now.

“I don’t have any complaints. I seriously have no idea why some of my colleagues went to meet Prime Minister to ask for work. In fact, I feel so comfortable now, and I might not be able to function as a Minister if some work was brought before me.” said the MoS, who didn’t want to be quoted but we will refer him as Aaram Babu for the rest of the article.

One of the buildings where many ministers work, well, almost

Babu also revealed that he has now come around to enjoy his lifestyle, where he has enough time to feed the pigeons visiting his Lutyen’s Delhi bungalow apart from watching family soaps on television with his wife.

“I really wonder if Saarika is actually conspiring against her mother-in-law. Our society has grown so complex.” said a pensive Babu as he discussed his daily routine with our reporter.

But Aaram Babu is not a permanent feature at home because of lack of work. He goes to his office daily in his Ambassador car and spends hours before his laptop. Babu has a very strong social life in the virtual world.

“I often wondered how Shashi Tharoor could keep so busy despite being a Minister of State. After the ‘cattle class’ controversy, I started surfing internet and joined twitter, orkut, and facebook. It keeps me busy during my office hours.” said Babu, who is fan of pages like “Sleeping”, “I love my job”, and “Randomly laughing because you remembered something funny” on facebook.

To enjoy the leisure time that he gets after finishing his routine work at office and at home, Aaram Babu has got a swing installed in his bungalow garden where he spends time reading some of his favorite magazines. He gave this interview on the same swing.

“It’s a very simple swing and didn’t cost much. I deliberately didn’t buy that costlier Swiss design swing as we were told to follow austerity.” Babu said as he caressed the cushion of the swing seat.

Aaram Babu believes that the exercise by some of his colleagues to meet PM for work would go in vain as it was not the job of a PM to create jobs.

“Do they really think that PM can create jobs? Bullshit! How many jobs were created during recession? It’s a free economy, forces of demand and supply will work. Yeah, it’s a different matter if something on the lines of NREGA was offered.” said Babu, mooting the idea for National Minister’s Employment Guarantee Act (NMEGA), but pleaded to keep himself out of the purview of this act.

After Priyanka Gandhi, it’s time for another politician to feature in a calendar released by their supporters. Janata Dal (Secular) has released a 2010 calendar featuring former Prime Minister and party leader H.D. Deve Gowda in twelve different sleeping poses. The step is being seen as an attempt to change the image of Gowda, who drew a lot of flak for using swear words against Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.

The first page of the calendar released by Janata Dal (Secular)

“We are not trying any image makeover; such talks are driven out of political prejudices. We are just trying to create awareness in the country in favor of sleeping. People today have lost their sleep and we hope they would be inspired to take a sound nap after the release of this calendar.” Janata Dal (Secular) spokesperson Y.S.V. Datta denied that the calendar was released to help the image of Deve Gowda.

Releasing the calendar at press conference here, various party leaders underscored the problems faced by the citizens of the country and how such problems have taken away their sleep. Deve Gowda was sleeping throughout the press conference.

“Price rise, loss of jobs, threats by China and Pakistan, rising crime, and an indifferent government has made people of India spend sleepless nights. Our party thought a lot about such problems and we decided to go back to the tried and tested mean shown by our leader. We are now trying to promote sound sleeping among the citizens of the nation.” party leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said.

The calendar shows Deve Gowda in different sleeping poses in each month of 2010 that ranges from sleeping in the parliament, in parties, during conferences, during festivals, etc. to peacefully sleeping in his couch, wearing colorful and designer lungis and angavastram. Party workers have been promised one free copy each of the calendar, but they will have to buy extra copies. One complimentary copy of the calendar has also been sent to the Chief Minister’s office.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/deve_gowda_sleeping.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/janata-dal-secular-releases-sleeping-deve-gowda-calendar-557,Janata Dal Secular releases sleeping Deve Gowda calendar,,1263459397.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-caught-in-bed-with-rival-politician-justifies-conduct-517,"Ranchi. A well known political leader Simba Suri was caught in a compromising position with his rival Arjun Mehta when both of them were seen half naked in the official bed of Suri, all this in a rather chilling winter. Various television channels have been playing the gayish visuals continuously, terming it a shocking sex-scandal, but the leaders have termed their act as being a ‘done thing’ in the contemporary politics.

“What’s so shocking about it? Have you guys seen it for the first time? Politics has been making strange bedfellows for decades now, only that this time around you guys could click some pictures. It’s a shame on the voyeuristic journalism of modern times. I heard many of you guys downloaded pictures from gay galleries and broadcasted them. That’s such a shame!” Suri put the blame squarely on the journalists for cheap sensationalism.

Suri and Mehta had panicked after journalists went into their room

Even though Suri and Mehta are putting up a stiff upper lip now, they had panicked when journalists had first broken into their room to find them together in the bed. It should be noted that Suri and Mehta have been sworn rivals of each other attacking each other regularly on the charges of corruption and communalism. Though Suri was suspected of being gay, the sexual preferences of Mehta too have now come under question after this incident.

Other politicians from the state, especially those who were often seen moving hand in hand with Simba Suri in parks and multiplexes, have termed the incident as ‘shameful’ and have demanded that both the leaders be tried for cheating on their wives. Interestingly, wives of both Suri and Mehta are namesakes – Janta Devi. But legal experts are not too sure if the leaders can be tried for being unfaithful.

“Gay sex was sanctioned only last year in India, and the laws are kinda silent if a man could be tried for being unfaithful to his wife if he gets a gay partner. It would be interesting if Janta Devi decides to sue her husband.” leading constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said.

Either of Janta Devis were not available for comments as they were busy watching saas-bahu serials and shopping for vegetables. But both Suri and Mehta are sure that their wives won’t take any action against them.

“I did it for my beloved Janta darling. She wanted a new bed-sheet for the new year as the earlier one was sullen after madhu (honey) fell on it. I was discussing bed-sheets with Suri when you shameless guys barged in. We were just following our Janta’s wishes.” Arjun Mehta said, sending out confusing signals whether the leaders indulged in gay sex or not, the question everyone seems to be most worried about.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Strange_Bedfellows-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-caught-in-bed-with-rival-politician-justifies-conduct-517,"Politician caught in bed with rival politician, justifies conduct",,1261984539.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-starts-fast-in-andhra-pradesh-but-no-one-knows-why-487,"Hyderabad. Anjeer Reddy, the national president of a little known regional party called Disha Bhramit Rajyam (DBR), has announced his plans to go on an indefinite fast over the issue of separate statehood for Telangana. Mr. Reddy has stopped taking food from this morning and aims to continue doing so till all his demands are met by the government, but nobody yet knows what his demands are; even Mr. Reddy declined to divulge.

“It is important that I fast for people’s right and make their voices heard in the corridors of power.” announced a fasting Anjeer Reddy in a press conference, where a feast was thrown open for the journalists. When asked what his demands were, he said, “My demands are the same as what people of Andhra Pradesh want. I do not want to impose my own will over them. I am fasting for the public not for my party. This Telangana issue is very important you know.”

This photo, allegedly showing members of DBR, was produced by Anjeer Reddy to prove that his party cared for rights of common people

DBR has not been much in news and nobody knows if the party supports or opposes the creation of a separate Telangana state, but the party considers the issue as being absolutely vital for the development of India in general and Andhra Pradesh in particular.

“Our members have been feeling suicidal over the issue and last night one of them even attempted suicide. The situation was turning grave you know. Something has to be done about it. The government must take some sort of action.” these were the only specific sounding demands that Anjeer Reddy could put forward during the press conference.

When asked if he supported creation of smaller states in principle, not necessarily with respect to creation of Telangana, Anjeer Reddy said, “It is a good question and should be debated nationally. The common man must get answers and I would do everything for it. Our party would put the required pressure on the center so that right things are done.”

Till now the number of politicians fasting in support of creation of Telangana was equal to those fasting to oppose the creation. Anjeer Reddy would have tilted the balance of power in favor of one of these groups, but his stand has made the whole situation even more nebulous. Some people believe that Mr. Reddy would strike a deal with either of the groups after his fast enters the fourth day and the first headline. But Mr. Reddy has rubbished such charges.

“I am fasting but that does not mean that I am hungry for power.” said an hungry angry Reddy.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hyderabad_india-250x182.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-starts-fast-in-andhra-pradesh-but-no-one-knows-why-487,"Politician starts fast in Andhra Pradesh, but no one knows why",,1261046265.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/new-medicine-liberhanagra-causes-multiple-orgasms-in-old-fogeys-420,"New Delhi. Pharmaceutical company Pfizer has tested a new drug called Liberhanagra that is reportedly capable of causing multiple orgasms among straitlaced old fogeys. The drug was successfully tested in two laboratories called RS and LS among volunteers numbering over 600. Scientists could record strange sounds and catcalls, believed to be emanating out of sheer excitement and titillation, as soon as primary doses of Liberhanagra was administered to them.

“This is working just fine. These old fogeys showed no excitement even when Viagra, our most successful product was given to them. But Liberhanagra looks like the only thing they were waiting for. In fact we have unconfirmed reports suggesting that these old fogeys had indulged in prolonged foreplay when an Indian newspaper had published the news about launch of Liberhanagra. It’s just amazing!” a scientist at the RS laboratory said.

Huge sales of Liberhanagra is expected this winter

Pfizer claims that Liberhanagra is the first “open-source” drug in the world and it has made its formula public. A lot of people downloaded the formula and tried to analyze it but couldn’t make much sense out of it.

“I read the formula documentation; it’s quite meandering and very complicated. But I guess they have used opium while making it. I don’t know if it’s good for the masses.” Sameer, a net savvy youth, who spent five hours studying the formula, told Faking News.

Strangely, the new drug seems to be completely ineffectual when administered to the new generation. Pfizer tested the drugs on dozens of boys and girls in their 20’s and they didn’t show even the signs of getting titillated, forget erection or orgasms.

“Not only people in their 20’s, a bulk of those in 30’s and even the elder ones, are not responding to the drug. In fact most of them complained of nausea and headache when we administered Liberhanagra shots to them in rather modest quantity. We had to give tequila shots to them to neutralize the effect.” another scientist at LS laboratory informed.

Pfizer had come up with this drug after extensive research and development spanning over 17 years and after spending over 8 crores rupees. This is the first drug developed in India to cure impotency among old fogeys, especially those who are in important positions and influence others’ lives. Pfizer claims that Liberhanagra would cure these old fogeys of their impotence, but not everyone is upbeat about the prospects.

“Well, it’s true that the old fogeys got all horny, but what is this going to achieve for us? What are they going to do with this new found vigor? To add to that Pfizer has not talked about side-effects or precautions. I guess it’s all waste of time and money. The problem with these old fogeys doesn’t lie in their genitals, but in their genesis.” Kabir, a 23-year-old unemployed MBA said.

But the old fogeys are quite happy and they are looking forward to a hot and satisfying session in winter ahead.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/viagra-pills-250x172.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/new-medicine-liberhanagra-causes-multiple-orgasms-in-old-fogeys-420,New medicine Liberhanagra causes multiple orgasms in old fogeys,,1259067563.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bacardi-to-sponsor-liberhan-commission-report-13,"New Delhi. After the opposition cried foul over ‘selective leakage’ of some parts of Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan Commission of Inquiry report into the demolition of Babri Mosque to the media, fresh allegations have emerged over government using the report to its benefit. New findings have revealed that the government is not only aiming to reap political benefits out of it, but there are definite plans to realize monetary benefit out of the report.

Rum, Ram and Report

Our sources confirm that the government is currently busy finalizing sponsorship deals with various groups for the public release of the report, and it seems that the deal would be bagged by the Bermuda based spirits company Bacardi. Both these events – sponsorship of the report and public release of the findings – would be soon announced in a press conference (and not in the winter session of the Parliament as is widely believed by many) hosted by Home Minister P Chidambaram.

This would mean that there would be big logos and pictures of Bacardi brands in the backdrop at the launch event. The front page of the report would mention “Bacardi presents” and each page will have watermark of Bacardi logo. Since journalists don’t like reading full reports and prefer trusting summaries written by the government, a small booklet named “Bacardi Blasts” would be released containing highlights of the findings. Furthermore, the report will refer to the persons implicated by the commission for the Babri demolition e.g. Atal, Advani, et al. as “Bacardi Boys”.

This sponsorship deal has been reportedly valued at 16 crore rupees by the government and our sources inform that Bacardi might fall in with without much negotiation. If the deal goes through, Liberhan Commission would be the first and the only inquiry commission in the history of independent India to have earned profits for the government.

It should be noted that Liberhan Commission, a one man commission, was expected to submit its report in February 1993 itself, within three months of its constitution. But it took around 17 years to complete the report and cost the government a whopping 8 crore rupees. But with this deal, the commission would actually help the government make 8 crore rupees over the expenses.

“Our target is to bring down the fiscal deficit this budgetary year and such steps are going to help us realize this goal. There are many commissions who have not yet submitted their reports and we would strive for similar deals with all of them. UPA government will change the definition of such commissions.” an officer at the PMO said on conditions of anonymity.

Bacardi’s sponsorship of Liberhan Commission report is expected to heat up the competition in the Indian beverages and liquor market. Market analysts believe that this is the first time a group would strongly challenge Dr. Vijay Mallya’s innovative marketing strategies and give the UB group a run for their money.

“Mallya had always used Sex and Cricket for marketing as Indians are very interested in both, and he was right too. But Religion and Politics are two other things that Indians love even more than Cricket and sometimes even Sex. While Dr. Mallya had unsuccessfully tried politics and kept away from religion, Bacardi has struck a masterstroke with this deal.” Marketing guru Suhail Seth said.

Management of Bacardi is also upbeat about the prospects and feels that this sponsorship deal will strongly entrench the company into the Indian mindset, making them the market leaders. Management believes that since the Babri issue is not expected to be resolved in any foreseeable future, the company can reap the benefits of this sponsorship for an indefinite time period. They denied the possibility that Bacardi could antagonize either Hindus or Muslims by such sponsorships.

“We have always believed in walking the middle path. You might know that we had good relationship with both Fidel Castro as well as the CIA. So there is no reason why we can’t take the middle path here. This is just a shift from Rum and Revolution to Rum and Religion in our approach, which we think will surely work in India. And hasn’t one of your poets written that Temples and Mosques created differences among people while Liquor united them?” Bacardi chairman Facundo L. Bacardi quoted Harivansh Rai Bachchan’s lines from Madhushala.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/BacardiLogo2008.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bacardi-to-sponsor-liberhan-commission-report-13,Bacardi to sponsor Liberhan Commission report on Babri demolition,,1258964407.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/six-months-old-baby-resembling-karl-marx-gives-renewed-hope-to-communists-383,"Bongaon, West Bengal. A six-months-old baby here is giving renewed hope and confidence to communists after they faced severe setbacks in recent elections and by-elections in West Bengal and Kerala. This baby boy has been attracting large crowds of devotees due to his striking resemblance with communist philosopher Karl Marx. Many people in West Bengal, ruled by communists over three decades now, believe the baby to be a reincarnation of Marx, thus proving that communism will be back in the state with a new found vigor.

“The baby looks so much like Marx Dada. His mother says that red is his favorite color and he doesn’t drink milk till his cat is given one bowl full after taking out from the bowl of the family dog. He is no one else but Marx-da himself. He is the one.” Jyoti Dasgupta, a devotee said.

Baby Marxy is amused by the attention he has been attracting

Devotees are bringing lot of edibles and milk with them. The whole village is full of red flags and various unions of devotees have come up to take care of crowd management and upbringing of the baby, fondly being called as Marxy by them. The state government of West Bengal has announced that all the devotees would be given free food and lodging facilities for a minimum period of next three months. This has led some people from neighboring Bihar and Orissa to set off for Bongaon even though they admitted that they didn’t know a thing about Karl Marx or communism.

Communist parties have also demanded that a special train carrying devotees from Tripura and Kerala to Kolkata should be run to facilitate the pilgrimage, but Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee has straightaway refused the demands of the communists. She termed the whole affair as fraud and has accused ruling CPM of using cheap tricks to win public support. She claimed that the mother of Marxy was actually a victim of atrocities by CPM workers but she was sweet-talked by the leftist workers to be a part of this drama and earn handsomely.

“A special train will be run, but it will carry Leftists out of West Bengal after assembly elections. It’s a shame that they are now using babies for their propaganda.” Mamta thundered.

Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya has downplayed all the controversies surrounding the incident and instead appealed to the media and intelligentsia to take note of the hidden signs.

“Marxy was born on 16th May earlier this year when communist parties in India had faced their biggest defeat in Lok Sabha elections. Clearly it’s the case of a phoenix rising form its ashes. People writing off communist parties in India should just look at this baby. We are alive and kicking.” Mr. Bhattacharya said in a press conference in Kolkata.

CPM polit bureau is believed to be thinking over ways to engage Marxy during next assembly elections that are due in 2011. Experts believe that Marxy would be grown up enough by then to deliver some election speeches.

Veteran communist leader Jyoti Basu has appealed to Congress to support CPM and proposed a joint strategy where Rahul Gandhi would campaign for Congress and Marxy for the left parties.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/baby-marx-235x249.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/six-months-old-baby-resembling-karl-marx-gives-renewed-hope-to-communists-383,Six months old baby resembling Karl Marx gives renewed hope to communists,,1257928230.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

Government has decided to reward the brave bear, who mauled two Hizbul terrorists to death in Jammu & Kashmir, by appointing him the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra. With this step, the government is also hoping to address the leadership and political crisis in Maharashtra where a new government is yet to be formed even as it’s been almost two weeks since the assembly election results were announced. But it seems that the decision might be mired in controversies.

“The bear will be an interim and caretaker Chief Minister till Congress and NCP reach a compromise formula on power sharing.” Home Minister P Chidambaram informed while praising the patriotic bear for its deeds, adding, “I think it’s good for the people of Maharashtra and citizens of Mumbai to have a Chief Minister who has firsthand experience of dealing with terrorists, especially after we have received intelligence reports that India was still vulnerable to 26/11 type of attack. We hope to convince the great bear for this job.”

Exclusive file photo of the brave bear

Local leaders of Congress and NCP stayed away from commenting over the decision but leaders from both the groups were trying to claim that the bear was ideologically nearer to their respective parties. BJP and Shiv Sena, although have favored installing a life-size statue of the bear in the city, have ridiculed the decision to make him the head of the state. The coalition has asked the governor to instead allow them to form the government as they could maul anyone as effectively as any grizzly bear.

But most vocal in their protests were activists from MNS, who threatened to bash up bhaiyyas if an outsider was made the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. MNS has demanded that the bear should first prove that it knew Marathi and respected Marathi culture before it was even allowed to enter the city. The party made clear that they were not against bears but local interests must be respected.

Our staff reporter was hit on his head with a hockey stick when he pointed out to the MNS workers that the bear could as well be termed as a local, because bulls and bears were long associated with BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) and were a part of the local culture. Apparently MNS workers didn’t like him uttering Bombay instead of Mumbai. Our reporter has been rushed to a government hospital nearby.

“It’s unfortunate that your reporter had to undergo this, but he made an important observation that must not be overlooked. At a time when the economy is still going through troubled phase, I guess we should avoid having a bear as head of the state. We should look for eligible bulls.” a political expert said.

Meanwhile the brave bear, unaware to these developments, has been sleeping in his cave all alone, even as various mediapersons have gathered outside his cave to take his exclusive interviews. Faking News reporter was the first person who tried to get inside the cave for an exclusive bite.

Within hours of some unidentified virus, suspected to be belonging to the Swine Flu group, attacking Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, comes the claim of Gujarat Police that they have gunned down the suspected virus in an encounter. While the Gujarat government is claiming that the encounter was an achievement and an important step towards safety of people, the opposition parties have termed it as a fake encounter. Congress has demanded a CBI enquiry into the whole episode.

“Narendra Modi had gone to Russia and was tested positive for Swine Flu after he returned. Clearly it was a Russian virus that attacked him, but the state police have killed an Indian virus. It defies all logic and shows how much unreasonable and trigger happy the state administration has become under Modi. Furthermore, did anyone see even the dead body of the virus? This is as fake as it can get.” Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela said.

Exclusive photo of Swine Flu virus

Police sources have informed that the dead body of the killed virus was immediately quarantined and sent for post-mortem and that’s why no one could see it. They refused the demands of media persons to let them see the dead body citing security and health reasons. Narendra Modi, who is also being quarantined for similar reasons after testing positive for H1N1 virus this morning, has issued a statement praising the police for the brave act.

“5.0671017 crore Gujaratis are proud of their police forces, who have relentlessly encountered all kinds of problems all by themselves to let the common man enjoy daandiya fearlessly. Friends from Congress are habituated of making imaginary accusations and I pray to god that they get some sense. I hope and pray that each and every of such viruses would be soon neutralized, that’s the final solution.” a statement from Chief Minister’s office read.

Apart from the political class, which is usually divided over most of the issues, even the scientists and doctors are deeply divided over this issue. Most of the doctors have expressed displeasure over the police department killing viruses.

“It’s our job to kill germs and viruses. Police must not meddle into our affairs. This is just as bad as judiciary meddling into the affairs of the legislature, and we all know how bitterly the political class had reacted then. But now, none of them are talking about this issue, instead they are playing politics over it. We are politely appealing to our police forces not to take up jobs that are our prerogative.” Dr. Hemal Desai said.

Serious objections have been raised by microbiologists and scientists as well, who have objected to the use of the term “killed” for a virus. Opinions differ among the scientific community on whether viruses are a form of life. They have been described as “organisms at the edge of life” by many. Scientists have appealed to the media and the police force not to spread misinformation by making headlines like “Swine Flu virus killed”.

Faking News ignored their appeal as it’s our policy to be more concerned about traffic than veracity of facts.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/virus-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/swine-flu-virus-killed-in-encounter-in-gujarat-opposition-cry-foul-351,"Swine Flu virus killed in encounter in Gujarat, opposition cry foul",,1256894388.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/rss-appoints-goldman-sachs-as-investment-bankers-for-acquiring-bjp-329,"Nagpur. In an unprecedented move that has never been seen in the political circles anywhere in the world, RSS has appointed Goldman Sachs as the investment bankers to help them with the acquisition of BJP. Goldman Sachs will help in asset valuation and debt restructuring of BJP, identification of synergies for RSS, and advice on organizational integration post the acquisition. The amount of brokerage payable to Goldman Sachs for these services was not disclosed.

After a dismal performance in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year and losses in the assembly elections earlier this week, calls for acquisition of BJP by RSS had been getting stronger. Our sources inform that RSS wanted to carry out this task in the most professional way possible, and finally they decided to go the corporate way. RSS could re-launch BJP as a private limited company post this acquisition.

“The top leaders of the BJP will be asked to invest money in the new company. This will make sure that all the leaders will work together to realize higher market valuation of the party, including those who could be looking for exit options. In the current political scenario, if a leader is looking for an exit option, he or she starts working to bring the market valuation down. It happens in each party.” Ram Madhav, RSS spokesperson explained the logic.

Investment Bankers of Goldman Sachs moving in RSS uniform

The current BJP leaders are tight lipped about the development, but sources say that the move by RSS has foxed them completely.

“We are a right-wing party, but this is going just too far right. Money should not be the only criteria of investment. We have worked for so many years to bring BJP to this level (sic) and our contributions must be taken into account.” A party leader told on conditions of anonymity.

RSS has tried to dispel such concerns and has assured that the prior contributions by the existing leaders would indeed be taken into account through the ‘asset valuation’ process. But it was yet not clear on what basis the leaders would be valued. Goldman Sachs officials too refused to divulge the parameters saying it was a “classified” matter. Unconfirmed reports say that instances like finding controversial mosques could be one of the most highly valued parameter.

When Faking News contacted SEBI to ask if they would allow listing of a political party for active trading on bourses, the officials couldn’t come up with a satisfactory answer. SEBI has called a meeting of its officials and policy makers later next week to discuss the issue.

“It would indeed be an interesting situation if RSS approaches SEBI for listing the new BJP shares for active trading. But I guess it would be better for our democracy. We have been listening about horse trading for so long and we all know that money plays such an important factor in politics today. It would be a step towards transparency.” a stock market specialist opined.

It’s yet not clear how RSS zeroed upon Goldman Sachs for the job, but our experts inform us that two factors could have gone in the favor of the Manhattan based investment bank.

BJP has vehemently denied the allegations that party president Rajnath Singh violated any air traffic rule by ordering his plane to take off in darkness. Party claims that supporters of Rajnath Singh had illuminated the runway with Happydent teeth to help the chartered plane in taxiing smoothly before taking off. BJP is expected to submit thousands of wrappers of Happydent chewing-gums as a proof to the concerned authorities.

“The charges are politically motivated and full of political vendetta. Congress doesn’t say anything when their own leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, violate security rules. In fact they go all out and support them. And here is a case where our leader and our workers showed amazing presence of mind in helping a plane take off and Congress is making ugly noises. BJP’s got talent and Congress is jealous.” BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

Mr. Naqvi also said that BJP was a party that was well versed in handling vehicles of all sorts and it did not need to follow any ‘external’ rules. The party has been accused of flouting Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) norms.

“What rubbish! We are a party that was created by driving a Rath. Our associations with trains are also well known. Our leaders are high flying. We know all kinds of traffic rules inside out and don’t need any external help. Rajnathji didn’t do anything wrong.” Mr. Naqvi argued.

Aviation experts and dentists are divided over the issue with. While aviation experts are not sure how could an airport be functional without lights on the runways, dentists believe that the incident could seriously damage the teeth of the BJP workers, who tried to help Rajnath Singh.

“There could be dentures and fractures in their (BJP workers’) teeth as planes send out very strong waves and vibrations to nearby objects. It could seriously harm their teeth and most of them could lose their teeth in near future.” Manjan Mehra, a leading dentist warned.

The warnings by dentists have further put BJP in trouble as the party could as well face fresh charges of endangering the dental health of their supporters. BJP is also worried of losing the appeal of being a party of the young and the strong if their supporters start losing their teeth early.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Happydent-Palace.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/bjp-workers-had-used-happydent-gums-to-help-rajnath-plane-fly-319,BJP workers had used Happydent gums to help Rajnath’s plane fly,,1256042858.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fucking-awesome-rahul-gandhi-rides-a-bicycle-on-delhi-roads-317,"New Delhi. The union of India saw delirious scenes yesterday when Rahul Gandhi, a smart and young politician, was seen cycling on the roads of the national capital. The citizens forgot their miseries for a while when they saw the Yuvraaj of Congress, as Rahul is fondly addressed by many, beautifully balancing the two rolling wheels of the vehicle interconnected with a polygon shaped maze of aluminum rods.

“It was fucking awesome! He was looking sooooooo cute! He is so admirable. People have forgotten the importance of cycling and all they do these days is to pedal some silly cycles in some gym. I’m sure Rahul wanted to send out this message to the world. His message has such an impact as dimples are formed on his cheek. Oh my god!” Rupesh Pant, a JNU student said.

Awesome! God level! Mast hai!

Rahul wore a blue T-shirt and red shorts, while sporting dark glasses. Experts believe that Rahul was again sending out a message to the world that red and blue could co-exist. In the USA, red color is used for Republicans while blue color is used for Democrats. Taking a cue, a national Hindi news channel of India declared Rahul as the Obama of India.

Rahul had gone out on this bicycle ride in the morning yesterday, and by the evening people were convinced that he had all the capabilities of leading India. It was established beyond doubt that he inspired confidence and hope among the common citizens of India.

“At a time when people in Delhi were scared to venture out on roads due to open manholes and drains, Congress leader has inspired confidence and dispelled these fears among the citizens. These are the kind of leaders India needs today. I am full of hope. Even companies like Avon and Hero have expressed hope that the incident would push up sales of their products.” Pramod Sharma, a leading journalist said.

But detractors of Rahul Gandhi didn’t miss even this opportunity to malign him. Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh claimed that whatever Rahul did was not new as Mulayam Singh Yadav had been riding bicycle for ages. For once, even Mayawati seemed to take the same line as Samajwadi Party leaders and accused Rahul Gandhi of creating ‘nuisance’.

“Yuvraaj of Congress was not wearing any helmet even though he rode a racing cycle on a busy Delhi road. There were no knee caps as well. It’s his habit to ignore security measures as he has been doing the same all through his trips in the UP villages. I hope that the Delhi traffic police, if they are not anti-dalit, send him a challan for this behavior.” Mayawati said.

Congress has trashed all such claims and accused the rival parties of being jealous of the rising popularity of Rahul Gandhi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/rahulg-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fucking-awesome-rahul-gandhi-rides-a-bicycle-on-delhi-roads-317,Fucking awesome!

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalitha-refuses-honorary-degree-in-kalaignar-thoughts-309,"Chennai. AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha has expressed deepest anguish and anger after Madras University decided to grant her honorary degree in the postgraduate course in Kalaignar Thoughts. The recently announced course is aimed at making people aware of thoughts and beliefs of DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi, who is also called Kalaignar by his supporters and happens to be the bete noir of Jayalalitha.

While AIADMK thinkers workers have criticized the university for stooping so low to be in the good books of the ruling party, G Thiruvasagam, the new vice-chancellor of Madras University, has justified the move as he claimed that the act will bring international recognition to the university and to the state.

An angry Jayalalitha refused the degree in Kalaignar Thoughts

“University of Madras would get listed in Guinness Book of World Records for awarding a degree in the shortest time ever for any course. It’s been just three days since we announced the introduction of the course and now we will have a student graduating with the degree even without a single class being held. No other university in the world can match us and beat us.” Thiruvasagam claimed.

Expectedly, Jayalalitha went livid at being called a student and that too of a course in Kalaignar Thoughts. She refused the degree straightaway and trashed the claims of the vice-chancellor while accusing the DMK government of bringing disrepute to the state by making false claims in the field of education.

“Earlier people from Periyar University had claimed to have discovered dinosaur eggs, which is now being termed as mere rocks by some experts. Now Madras University claims to have discovered a postgraduate degree in Kalaignar Thoughts, which surely would turn out to be lessons in kindergarten rhymes. If the university wants to award a real degree, they should start a Ph.D. in Amma Thoughts.” Jayalalitha suggested.

Our sources confirm that many academicians, after taking cue from the AIADMK chief’s statement, have already started work on course design for Ph.D. in Amma Thoughts in case AIADMK combine wins the next assembly polls.

Meanwhile, in an unrelated development, students from Tamil Nadu have been frantically trying various permutations and combinations of keywords like “job prospects” “expected salary” “campus placements” etc. on Google search ever since the announcement of new courses in Kalaignar Thoughts, Periyar Thoughts and Anna (not Amma) Thoughts was made by the University of Madras.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/amma-200x249.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalitha-refuses-honorary-degree-in-kalaignar-thoughts-309,Jayalalitha refuses honorary degree in Kalaignar Thoughts,,1255847417.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-border-with-china-to-be-fenced-with-nimbu-mirchi-294,"New Delhi. After expressing regret, disappointment, and heartbreak over China’s objection, outrage, and warning on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, India has finally decided to secure its border with China by fencing it with nimbu-mirchi (lemon and chili).

Nimbu-mirchi is a popular and reliable tool among Indians for warding off evil forces from attacking them. The decision has drawn mixed reactions from various quarters.

“I don’t believe in black magic. I see it as a security step while you call it superstition. Just like I go to a poor man’s house and you call it a dalit’s house,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi justified the move of the government, saying it was a befitting reply to the nonsensical uttering of China.

Such tools will be deployed along the border with China to protect us from the enemy

BJP has surprisingly welcomed the decision as it believes that the step will secure the Indian territory from the evil eyes of the Chinese, but has criticized the government of doing ‘too little too late’.

The party has demanded that black worn out shoes should also be hung from the barbed wires along with a board with the message “buri nazar wale tera munh kala” (o ye man with the evil eyes, let your face be black) written in Chinese on it. But Congress has rejected the suggestion saying it can jeopardize India’s relationship with the African countries.

Defense experts have by and large welcomed the step calling it a welcome change from the usual ‘appeasement policy’ followed by India in the bilateral relations, but have cautioned that China could very well ‘misuse’ and ‘misappropriate’ the tools employed by India.

“We must make sure that they don’t run away with the lemon and chilies to make hakka noodles or chili chicken. We have intelligence reports that Chinese are actually looking forward to the fencing of the border and ready to replace our lemon and chilies with Chinese ones, which are of quite inferior quality and may not work as intended,” Vishnu Bellani, a defense expert cautioned.

Meanwhile China has again expressed deep anguish and objection over these reports and has accused India of fomenting trouble along with the disputed borders by indulging in such acts. China has especially warned of dire consequences if Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was used for fencing the borders. It should be noted that Dalai Lama resides in Dharamsala, which is very near to Shimla in the hitherto undisputed Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

Common citizens of India have expressed hope over the development and are praying that peace prevails in the region, but they also fear that there could be a scam in the mass sourcing of the lemons and chilies in coming days, pushing the prices of goods, especially the food prices, further up. Many people have already started hoarding nimbu-mirchi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nimbu-250x176.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-border-with-china-to-be-fenced-with-nimbu-mirchi-294,Indian border with China to be fenced with Nimbu-Mirchi,,1255505892.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/raj-thackeray-apologizes-after-accidentally-threatening-and-abusing-himself-286,"Mumbai. In the first ever instance of its kind where he has apologized for something he said or did, MNS chief Raj Thackeray has expressed deepest regrets after he accidentally threatened and abused himself during an election rally. His party MNS has termed the incident as a momentary lapse of memory by Raj Thackeray in the heat of the moment, and has accused the media of giving undue importance to a small incident.

The incident happened in Pune where Raj Thackeray was addressing an election rally. Raj brokered the issue of outsiders vs. insiders again and swore that no one would be allowed to exhibit and flaunt their own culture and language on the Marathi soil. He declared that if MNS came to power, all the cultural events and other public activities would be tracked and tallied, and it would be made sure that 91.7% of all such events were by the Marathi Manoos, for the Marathi Manoos and of the Marathi Manoos.

Raj Thackeray addressing the rally where he almost abused and threatened himself

“Marathi art and culture must be respected and promoted. We are culturally rich and don’t need ugly Hindi movies and music to entertain ourselves. We don’t even need those vulgar English songs and dances. No bastard will be allowed to invite weird characters like Michael Jackson on Marathi soil and make a dirty display of foreign culture. We will cut the arms of such persons and throw them into the Arabian Sea.” Raj roared as his supporters clapped over the arrival of the new cultural policy.

But little did Raj and his supporters realize at that time that MNS chief had almost just threatened and abused himself. Michael Jackson’s concert in Mumbai was organized by Shiv Udyog Sena in 1996, and it was none other than Raj Thackeray, then a member of Shiv Sena, who had formed Shiv Udyog Sena. So did Raj Thackeray just call himself bastard and threatened to cut his own hands?

Such deep insulting insinuations towards their respected leader made the MNS workers go wild with rage. They avowed to avenge the insult and set out to bash up the person who had insulted Raj Thackeray, even if it happened to be Raj Thackeray himself in this bizarre case.

“MNS workers are like Salman Khan in Wanted, who had said – ek baar jo maine commitment kardi, uske baad toh main khud ki bhi nahi sunta (if I get into a commitment, I won’t even listen to myself to break it) – the same way, once the MNS workers decide to bash up someone for insulting Raj Thackeray or Marathi Manoos, no power on earth can stop them from carrying out the act.” an MNS leader told on conditions of anonymity.

Fearing getting bashed up by the MNS workers, Raj Thackeray decided to apologize for his remarks, and termed it as a ‘creative mistake’. Raj is also a cartoonist like his uncle Balasaheb Thackeray and considers himself a creative person.

“Creative people are bound to commit mistakes. A few days back Karan Johar had made a mistake, now I happened to do it. It’s a small incident misinterpreted and blown up by the Hindi media. But still I apologize to my workers and to the people of Maharashtra if they are hurt.” Raj clarified, after which MNS workers decided to forgive him and forget the incident.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/raj-249x188.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/raj-thackeray-apologizes-after-accidentally-threatening-and-abusing-himself-286,Raj Thackeray apologizes after accidentally threatening and abusing himself,,1255325435.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-falls-in-borewell-while-campaigning-for-elections-278,"Hisar. While campaigning for Assembly Elections, a politician fell in a borewell here and has got stuck in the well since then. Rescue team and police have reached the spot and attempts are on to pull out the politician identified as Teznayan Bhadana, an independent candidate secretly backed by Congress. Thirteen hours and thirty nine minutes had passed since Mr. Bhadana fell in the borewell and he was still stuck there when reports last came in.

Rescue officer Mr. Bachao Singh Bishnoi informed us that Mr. Bhadana was still alive as people could hear his speeches coming out of the borewell. It was not clear what Mr. Bhadana was trying to convey through his speeches from inside the well due to the echo effect, but it is believed that he was crying for help and accusing a political conspiracy behind keeping the borewell open.

According to eye-witnesses, Teznayan Bhadana had seen a little kid playing near borewell and had started running towards the kid immediately, but fell in the borewell that was left uncovered. While supporters of Mr. Bhadana claim that he ran to save the kid as he feared him falling in the borewell, his political opponents say that Bhadana was on his way to perform his usual gimmick of lifting a kid in his arms to be popular among the locals. Police had no opinion or knowledge on how Mr. Bhadana fell in the borewell.

Rescue operatations are on for Mr. Bhadana

Mr. Bhadana had gone to campaign in the area where government has been digging a borewell for the last five years, apparently to provide water to the locals as the farmers have been long complaining about problems of irrigation. According to government sources, the borewell would have been completed today had Mr. Bhadana not fallen inside. They fear that now the water level could go down after this incident. When Faking News asked for the basis for such fears, they refused to divulge the details.

Meanwhile a parallel borewell was being dug to reach out to Mr. Bhadana and pull him out. It was rather surprising to us to notice that the same machines and people could dig a parallel borewell so fast while they took almost five years to dig the original one. Faking News also fears that the whole attempt could go waste as the radius of the parallel borewell was smaller than radius of Mr. Bhadana’s potbelly and he could again get stuck while being pulled out.

Amidst all this, politics has got heated in Haryana over the incident. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala suspects that Congress was behind the incident and that Mr. Bhadana was paid huge sum of money to fall in the well. Mr. Chautala suspected foul play as he refused to believe that a grown up person could fall in a borewell when a little kid was playing safely in the same area.

“Mr. Bhadana is acting to create a sympathy wave in the state in favor of the ruling party. It’s also an attempt to grad media headlines. News Channels are known to telecast such events live and now the Congress government will put up posters and hoardings at those places so that the same get transmitted on the television channels, and they won’t even have to pay for this free publicity.” Mr. Chautala warned that borewell politics won’t succeed in Haryana.

Congress has vehemently denied these allegations and has accused INLD and BJP of doing nothing for locals, who are truly represented by Mr. Bhadana. Congress workers and supporters of Mr. Bhadana are in turn accusing INLD and BJP of trapping genuine leaders like Mr. Bhadana. They claimed that the land, where borewell was being dug, belonged to a BJP supporter, who has been absconding since Mr. Bhadana fell inside. Mr. Bhadana’s supporters have threatened to launch ‘rail todo’ agitation if he is not pulled out within next nine hours.

Away from politics, Faking News asks its readers to send ‘get well soon’ messages to 6969 and pray with us for Mr. Bhadana’s survival.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/BorewellFall-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-falls-in-borewell-while-campaigning-for-elections-278,Politician falls in borewell while campaigning for elections,,1255074078.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-fasting-for-their-political-leaders-on-karwa-chauth-face-hostility-269,"Hyderabad. Gay supporters of various political leaders faced hostility from their straight counterparts when they decided to fast today to wish long lives to their respective leaders. Today is the festival of Karwa Chauth, when seemingly faithful wives and apparently committed girlfriends fast the whole day to insure longevity to their maybe adulterous husbands or possibly two-timing boyfriends. This mode of public display of love and loyalty by gays has not gone down well with many people it seems.

A gay supporter of YSR’s son YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was beaten up when he applied Mehendi all over his body as a mark of love and loyalty towards his leader. He declared that he’d break his fast only after Jagan came up to him in the night and offered him food, apart from allowing him (the gay guy) to see him (Jagan Reddy) through a sieve. Straight supporters of Jagan thought that this act of the gay supporter suggested that Jagan was his gay partner, and hence a gay too.

The gay supporter of Jagan, who was bashed up for his love

“This is outrageous and nonsensical, we don’t approve of such gay gimmicks. If he really loved our leader he should have fasted until death unless Jagan Reddy was made the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is just a publicity hungry mongrel and we taught him a lesson.” one of the straight supporters of Jagan Reddy, who bashed up the gay supporter, said.

Similar gay supporters were beaten up in Ahmedabad who fasted for Narendra Modi, and in Mumbai who fasted for leaders like Thackerays and Sharad Pawar. The straight supporters were livid with these acts of gays as all of them deemed it disrespectful to their leaders. All of them averred that none of their leaders were gay, and hence they deserved straight display of affection.

But gay rights activists and liberal people have decried these gay bashings and have requested various political leaders and the civil society to allow the gays to express their love the way they wanted.

“This is illogical. If gay supporters’ ways makes the leaders gay, the straight supporters’ ways should make them criminal, rapists and arsonists. But none of these supporters objected when some straight supporters destroyed property and killed people to express their love and support to the respective leaders. The civil society must support the gays.” Ahmed Anju Iyer, the founder-president of Bhartiya Samlaingik Party (BSP) said.

BSP, the political party of people with alternative sexual preferences, has threatened to launch an agitation against such discrimination and violence against gays and has demanded that the next census should also record the sexual preferences of people in India so that the true strength of gays, lesbians, transsexuals and bisexuals could be known for sure, enabling them to influence policy decisions of the government and the society.

Common citizens of India have been apathetic to the whole issue, but many of them wondered why only gays were active on Karwa Chauth while none of the lesbians were fasting for their women leaders like Mamta Banerjee, Kumari Mayawati or Sonia Gandhi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/gay-250x195.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-fasting-for-their-political-leaders-on-karwa-chauth-face-hostility-269,Gays fasting for their political leaders on Karwa Chauth face hostility,,1254902852.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/anger-and-confusion-reigns-as-bihar-declared-a-part-of-maharashtra-267,"Patna. In a decision that could generate long lasting impact and controversy, the UPA government today declared Bihar as a part of Maharashtra and decided to call it North Maharashtra. This means that the state assemblies of erstwhile Bihar and Maharashtra will be merged and fresh elections will be ordered in the Greater Maharashtra. The new government will have all its offices and officials stationed in the existing city of Mumbai.

The decision has caused a widespread confusion and outrage among people as nobody is quite sure about the fallout of the merger of the two states. Biharis are furious as technically their state has been merged into Maharashtra, which means their independent identity will be lost. All Biharis hereafter will become Marathis, something that riles people of Maharashtra as well, especially the supporters of MNS led by Raj Thackeray.

“No bhaiyya is even a manoos, forget Marathi Manoos. This is an insult to Maharashtra by Congress and our party will take every possible step to prevent this merger. This is also a conspiracy by bhaiyyas to gain political control over Mumbai. If the government doesn’t take back its decision, we’ll whack all the bhaiyaa bhelpuri-vendors and taxi-drivers.” an MNS leader warned.

Once upon a time states in India were organized like this

The intellectuals among the MNS are planning to apply for a Geographical Indication (GI) patent for the term “Marathi Manoos” so that it becomes illegal for people residing outside the current political Maharashtra to call themselves Marathi Manoos. But they have already hit a roadblock because if the GI patent was granted, the current bhaiyya bhelpuri-vendors and taxi-drivers, apart from the other outsiders living in Mumbai, will also become Marathi Manoos, and the local Marathis may start empathizing with them, which could prove suicidal for their party.

On the other hand, political parties in Bihar have threatened to burn trains and smash all public offices if Bihar was wiped off the political map of India. Political pundits feel that it’s a conspiracy by Congress to gain some political power in a state they were completely wiped off and were forced to piggyback on parties like RJD and LJSP. RJD chief Lalu Yadav has threatened to dump Congress if the UPA government went ahead with the decision.

“Why should we be called North Maharashtra? If a merger is so essential, let Maharashtra be called South Bihar. There was no Maharashtra when India became independent, but there was a bigger Bihar. Bihar has always missed its mineral-rich southern part since Jharkhand was carved out, so it makes sense to add a richer southern part to our poor state, but it’s completely nonsense to call Bihar as North Maharashtra.” Lalu Yadav argued.

The government has claimed that the decision was a part of the ‘inclusive growth’ exercise and they will take further such decisions in futures, such as merging Cricket and Kabaddi. Experts believe that the decision of the government is ‘perplexing’, but they don’t think that the idea was abnormal or unusual.

“Most of the states and nations were created the same way. Political boundaries were drawn first and then some justification was proposed. With a new research suggesting that Aryan Dravidian theory could be a myth, lingual divide too seems to be phony. Anyway, the languages that some Biharis, such as Maithilis, speak hardly even resemble Hindi, so they might as well be called dialects of Marathi. Similarly not everyone in current Maharashtra speaks Marathi. So it’s not a big deal really.” Arindam Anand, a leading linguist said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/india_1947-250x248.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/anger-and-confusion-reigns-as-bihar-declared-a-part-of-maharashtra-267,Anger and confusion reigns as Bihar declared a part of Maharashtra,,1254834949.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a rather bizarre discovery, an NGO has found out that most politicians of India stand for elections just because they have piles (bawaseer in Hindi) and they find it painful to sit at one place. The finding was made public by a volunteer of the NGO during a press conference here today, although the NGO has accused the volunteer of misrepresenting and misinterpreting the facts.

“I felt that Rearing Democracy (name of the concerned NGO) was being bribed or intimidated by the big political parties and feared that these important findings could be buried by them, hence I have decided to call this press conference. And I am sure that most of you would be shocked to know that most of our politicians suffer from bawaseer (piles) and that’s why they keep on standing for elections and roam here and there. We have long misunderstood their movements as being social service, while in reality they are doing a service to their own bowel movements. This is shocking and an eye-opening fact that the citizens of India must know.” Maasoom Singh, the volunteer, shocked everyone present in the press conference by his claims.

Hakim Faiyaz Alam Islahi, one of the favorites to treat piles of politicians

The medical class of India has expressed shock over the findings, while various hakeems have come out with open offers of free treatment to the leaders in exchange for photos clicked with them.

But the political class of Indian seems to be too upset and has called Maasoom a mentally deranged person and has threatened to file a defamation suit against him if he didn’t drop his claims immediately. Leaders cutting across party lines have claimed that their clan was genuinely moved by people’s problems and their actions were controlled by their heart and minds, and not by assholes.

“This is such an absurd claim made by a person who is on a mission to murder democracy in India. We want to remind our citizens that no political leader had supported an IAS officer who was getting his piles treated in his office. If we too had been suffering from piles, hadn’t we showed some compassion for that officer as is generally seen in the cases of corruption? We want to reassure our citizens that their leaders are having no problems sitting or shitting.” a candidate standing for the Haryana Assembly Elections said.

But Maasoom is standing his ground and has asked the NGO Rearing Democracy to make their report public, which he claims specifically mentions that Indian leaders were suffering from piles. The NGO officials have gone underground for the moment as they fear retaliatory attacks from the supporters of various political parties, though they maintain that there has been a widespread confusion.

“Yes, the Executive Summary of our report did mention about piles, but it was an abbreviation. Our report claimed that most Indian leaders seem to be suffering from PILES disorder, but PILES stood for Physical, Intellectual, Lingual, Emotional, Social (and Spiritual) Development. Maasoom, being an MBA grad, didn’t care to read the whole report and made his conclusions based upon the Executive Summary only and jumped the gun. Now no one is ready to listen to our explanation as the disease piles has become the center of the controversy.” Akhil Akela, the head of Rearing Democracy expressed his frustration.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hakeem.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/most-politicians-stand-for-elections-just-because-they-have-piles-259,Most politicians stand for elections just because they have piles,,1254724207.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-does-a-rahul-spends-night-with-a-brahmin-family-210,"Chitrakoot. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and firebrand dalit leader Kumari Mayawati spent last night with a poor Brahmin family in Tilakpur village. She spent around eighteen hours with the family of Tulsi Tripathi, a poor Brahmin, starting from 5 PM on Friday to 11 AM on Saturday. She also took dinner, which was prepared without onions and garlic, and breakfast, prepared with goat milk and Texmati rice, with the family, before she decided to leave for Lucknow. The visit was a part of Chief Minister’s attempt to find out the real issues and problems of her people, a government press release told.

“It was a dream come true for us. Finally we can hope that something good can happen to us. Behenji promised that our children will get reservations in jobs. She also told that she will deliver a speech in the parliament informing the world how poorer we are becoming with each passing day. Only yesterday someone stole my goat.” Tulsi Tripathi told mediapersons.

Mayawati reaffirmed Tulsi of her support and accused Congress and Samajwadi Party supporters of creating law and order problems by stealing goats and looting Brahmins during her term. She accused other parties of showing no respect to Brahmins during their respective tenures and of exploiting them to their political benefits.

Behenji being felicitated by Brahmins

“What have these poor Brahmins got in return after supporting almost all political parties who got to power? They have neither respect nor rupees today. Their richer cousins are enjoying life in USA and dancing with Obama, and funding enemies of BSP with millions of dollars. These are my people, they are dalit Brahmins, the real harijans, the people of god.” Mayawati addressed hordes of Brahmins who clapped and pledged their support to her during elections.

Mayawati also performed a puja with the Brahmin family, where she took the role of the Goddess. After the puja, Mayawati inquired if the local Brahmins could write a Behenji Chalisa, to which the locals readily agreed.

The move is seen as Mayawati’s continuous attempt to consolidate support among the forward castes, especially Brahmins, to checkmate Congress’ attempts of wooing dalits and Samajwadi Party’s attempts to unite all backward castes. Experts believe that with this step, Mayawati has also given an answer to Congress, which has been projecting Rahul Gandhi as the original traveler and discoverer of rural India.

Expectedly, opposition parties in the state have decried Mayawati for adopting such ‘cheap’ tactics. Samajwadi Party has cautioned Brahmins against supporting BSP, claiming it to be a suicidal step for the community. The party has promised to replace all stolen goats of Brahmins with cows if they came to power.

Congress too has cautioned Brahmins and asked them to stick to their original party. The party also claimed that Mayawati had insulted Brahmins as she took bath with a special soap after coming back to Lucknow from the Brahmin colony. Congress has asked Mayawati to apologize to the Brahmin community for her humiliating acts.

When asked about this incident, Mayawati’s office refuted the charges vigorously and accused Congress of spreading rumors to create disharmony in the state. Her secretary informed that Mayawati always took bath with special soaps, for which ninety three lakh rupees were budgeted last year, and her bathing was a regular job and in no way related to her stay at a Brahmin’s house.

Furious by these allegations, Mayawati also fired fresh allegations against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of using a body-double while moving in trains as part of austerity drive. She also claimed that it was a duplicate of Rahul Gandhi who spent a night with a dalit family recently.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mayawati-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-does-a-rahul-spends-night-with-a-brahmin-family-210,"Mayawati does a Rahul, spends night with a Brahmin family",,1253945237.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-form-their-own-political-party-to-fight-assembly-elections-182,"Bengaluru. Encouraged by the fact that the central government didn’t ask for stay on Delhi High Court’s order on section 377 legalizing gay sex, gays have announced formation of Bhartiya Samlaingik Party (BSP), a political party representing people with alternative sexualities especially gays, lesbians, transsexuals and bisexuals. The new party will contest the coming assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh and will put up candidates on all the seats.

“BSP candidates would not necessarily be homosexuals, but we’d prefer and encourage homosexuals to come out in open and fight elections.” founding president of the BSP Ahmed Anju Iyer told a jampacked press conference, clarifying that the president of BSP would always be a gay though.

BSP declared three central issues around which its political campaign will revolve – Abrogation of Section 377 of Indian Penile Penal Code, Formation of a Homosexual Personal Law, and Building a grand mall/multiplex in Bengaluru for central activities of homosexuals in India that will be called Golmall (Gays Or Lesbians Mall).

Mr. Iyer, accompanies by gay rights activists, argued that time was ripe for gays and other groups to form a pressure group by entering politics. He warned that homosexuals would no longer tolerate victimization of their community and disrespect shown to their beliefs. He claimed that homosexuals were the most discriminated against minority group in India.

Time for a new beginning

“Gays are shown as funny people in Bollywood movies and gay jokes go unchecked on internet. Till recently, we used to tolerate such stuff but then we realized that in India people take you seriously only when you show pigheaded intolerance. We can’t change ourselves overnight but now we have learnt to stand up for our rights. And the results have been encouraging. Last year, this government had filed an affidavit in court arguing that we were a social vice and possessed pervert minds! Now the same government is wary of rubbing us the wrong way. BSP will make sure that no government in future tries to rub us the wrong way.” Mr. Iyer explained the political agenda.

Mr. Iyer cautioned that if victimization and criminal branding of homosexuals didn’t stop, some of them might be even forced to become terrorists. He informed that he has come to know of a group that has been formed to present the militant face of homosexuality. The group is called Homosexual Initiative for Militancy in India (HIMI). When journalists asked whether he was getting into unlawful activities through HIMI and talks of terrorism, Mr. Iyer refuted these charges as baseless.

“HIMI is not directly associated with us and we don’t know who the members of HIMI are. It might well be a conspiracy to defame homosexuals, we don’t know. But threat of terrorism looms large. I just want to caution our fellow citizens that a victimized minority group usually takes the path of terrorism and some of us may go that way.” Mr. Iyer expressed his concerns.

Mr. Iyer was candid enough to admit that absence of a common religion among homosexuals was the main reason why Indian homosexuals have not been able to form a pressure group or carry terrorist attacks till now. He claimed that the recent initiatives by Church in West to have special churches for homosexuals were attempts to convert homosexuals and weaken their attempts to form a pressure group.

The manifesto and constitution of BSP will be released next week and currently the thrust will be to induct new members. The party has not ruled out any seat sharing arrangement or post-poll alliance with another political party if it furthers the interests of gays and lesbians.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/gay_party-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-form-their-own-political-party-to-fight-assembly-elections-182,"Gays form their own political party, to fight assembly elections",,1253215271.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tharoor-clarifies-cattle-class-remark-blames-jackasses-for-confusion-180,"New Delhi. In an exclusive chat with Faking News before leaving for Ghana and Liberia, two of the most poorest counties of the world where he would have no choice but to live in austerity, Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor clarified his ‘cattle class’ remark, claiming that he didn’t use it to disrespect the aam aadmi (common man) of India. Tharoor blamed “jackasses” among Indian media and political class for misinterpreting and misrepresenting his tweet.

Following are the excerpts from the exclusive interview, which incidentally is the first ever interview of a human being by Faking News. Earlier we had interviewed two pigeons (Masakali of Delhi-6 and an aam kabootar of Mumbai) and one monkey (Monkeyman of Delhi). The interview was conducted in Mr. Tharoor’s car and lasted around couple of hours as his car got stuck in a traffic jam near Dhaula Kuaan on way to Indira Gandhi International Airport.

Faking News (FN): Thanks for letting us in your car Mr. Tharoor, we never saw such a luxurious car. Are you using tax payers’ money for this?

Shashi Tharoor (ST): (exhaustedly) yeah, I use taxpayer’s money to buy my diamond studded underwear too. Happy? Jackasses (murmurs)! People like you create all such confusion by assuming anything and everything.

FN: I’m sorry sir, but we never published any story about your comment or your lavish lifestyle. We are a news organization with a difference. We are in fact here to clear the confusion, instead of creating one. Do you want us to continue with the interview?

ST: hmmm… well, I’d take that on face value. Anyway, this traffic is hardly moving and I can’t even access my Twitter account on my iPhone. I have written to the Telecom Ministry to allot 3G spectrum as soon as possible, but we take so much time in taking any decision. I’m anyways bored so let’s continue.

FN: Thanks minister. So let’s start with the latest controversy, you apparently insulted the common man of India by calling them holy cows traveling in cattle class.

Shashi Tharoor in happier times

ST: That’s bullshit. First of all common man hardly travels by air, let alone business class or economy class. I’m surprised the way our media and political class defines aam aadmi. You guys can’t think beyond the middle and upper middle classes. Even if ‘cattle class’ is deemed as a hurtful term, it hardly hurts the aam aadmi, who actually rides cattle in the villages.

FN: So it’s alright to hurt the sentiments of middle classes?

ST: That’s your interpretation. I’d not clarify each and every thing that you go on to assume. I have seen many Indians playing FarmVille on facebook and they love to raise cattle and proudly publish the same on their walls. I guess the Indian middle class doesn’t find it hurtful to be saddled with cattle.

FN: What about ‘holy cows’?

ST: I don’t know how is that a hurtful term! Being called a cow has never been deemed as insulting in our country. The term ‘cow belt’ has been used for ages to define Hindi speaking areas, no one ever objected to it. Whoever is making such interpretations!

FN: Our Managing Editor Pagal Patrakar thinks that you used the term ‘holy cows’ for the Congress leaders who are on austerity drive, and you meant to say that you’d travel, rather unwillingly, by economy class to show solidarity with likes of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Is that true?

ST: Again, that’s your interpretation. In fact a Pagal’s interpretation. No comments.

FN: But what’s your take on austerity drive?

ST: It’s a nice idea.

FN: Apparently you didn’t like it, especially when you were told to vacate a five-star suite, expenses of which were being paid from your personal accounts as you claim?

ST: Okay, since you claim to be a news organization with a difference, let me tell you something. Dude, I feel this is going too far. Tomorrow they’d ask me to wear Rupa’s briefs and vests even though I like Versace. My lifestyle is my personal matter. There are people who fake personal travel as official one and then claim austerity by traveling in cattle class. That’s not austerity, that’s corruption!

FN: But shouldn’t you lead an exemplary life as a central minister?

ST: By wearing Rupa’s underwears? What kind of message would that send, if at all any? That even if one can afford a better lifestyle, one should not spend money? If I spend from my own pocket, I am actually doing good to our economy in these adverse conditions by increasing circulation of money in the market. Is that so difficult to understand?

FN: So you don’t like austerity at all? You believe in ‘if you have it, flaunt it’?

ST: Another of your interpretations. And who told you that I am not austere? When everyone, including Advani, took to blogging, I took to micro-blogging (twitter). Isn’t that austerity? I use so few words to express myself. I save hundreds of words each time I tweet.

FN: That’s an interesting point you make minister, but people are already baying for your blood. Media reports suggest that your party can take disciplinary action against you for your ‘cattle class’ remark. And now after we publish your interview, you might be expelled from the party!

ST: (sighs) That’d be really sad.

Faking News: Thanks for your time minister. We wish you all the best and a happy journey.

Shashi Tharoor: My pleasure. I might like to tweet about you sometime.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tharoor-201x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tharoor-clarifies-cattle-class-remark-blames-jackasses-for-confusion-180,"Tharoor clarifies ""cattle class"" remark, blames jackasses for confusion",,1253178180.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-inadvertently-submits-proof-of-low-cost-tour-to-us-officials-163,"Washington, D.C., USA. Home Minister P Chidambaram, who was on a four-day visit to USA to learn lessons in domestic security and international relations from US authorities, seemed to have accidentally submitted all the invoices, vouchers and bills of his visit in the office of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Chidambaram was supposed to submit those details to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in order to prove his austerity as a cabinet minister belonging to Congress.

P Chidambaram with Hillary Clinton after submission

“Home Minister was too busy meeting US officials and submitting documents to them to prove various stuffs like involvement of Pakistan in terror activities and steps taken by India to ensure safety of US citizens visiting India. Various other US departments too sought proofs and documents from him on issues like Nuclear Deal and rights of religious minorities in India. Mr. Chidambaram had gone into an almost autopilot mode of submitting documents and proofs, and in the same mode he happened to submit even the documents related to his low cost travel to US authorities.” an official who accompanied P Chidambaram on his US visit said.

Even though the documents were submitted inadvertently, the US authorities seem to have taken it quite seriously, as they have forwarded Chidambaram’s voucher and bills to the FBI for further investigations. This has caused a bizarre situation to arise as government of India has now realized that such steps by the USA amounts to interference in India’s domestic affairs and sovereignty. External Ministry of India has asked the US authorities to return Chidambaram’s invoices and stop the investigations, if possible.

“@hillaryclinton:It’s not cool, please return Chidambaram’s bills Hillary. God bless America.” read the latest tweet from Shashi Tharoor, Minister of State of External Affairs, who is also slated to submit bills of his stay in five-star suites to the Finance Ministry.

Sources inform Faking News that US authorities may drop the FBI investigations into the invoices and bills of P Chidambaram if the home ministry of India wrote a formal application, duly signed by the Home Minister and attested by the Prime Minister, and submitted it in person in the office of US President by Monday 10.00 AM EST. American ambassador to India has conveyed the same to the officials in home ministry, who have apparently warmed to the ‘suggestion’.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/indo-us-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-inadvertently-submits-proof-of-low-cost-tour-to-us-officials-163,Chidambaram inadvertently submits proof of low cost tour to US officials,,1252702340.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fucking-awesome-rahul-gandhi-rides-a-bicycle-on-delhi-roads-317,"New Delhi. The union of India saw delirious scenes yesterday when Rahul Gandhi, a smart and young politician, was seen cycling on the roads of the national capital. The citizens forgot their miseries for a while when they saw the Yuvraaj of Congress, as Rahul is fondly addressed by many, beautifully balancing the two rolling wheels of the vehicle interconnected with a polygon shaped maze of aluminum rods.

“It was fucking awesome! He was looking sooooooo cute! He is so admirable. People have forgotten the importance of cycling and all they do these days is to pedal some silly cycles in some gym. I’m sure Rahul wanted to send out this message to the world. His message has such an impact as dimples are formed on his cheek. Oh my god!” Rupesh Pant, a JNU student said.

Awesome! God level! Mast hai!

Rahul wore a blue T-shirt and red shorts, while sporting dark glasses. Experts believe that Rahul was again sending out a message to the world that red and blue could co-exist. In the USA, red color is used for Republicans while blue color is used for Democrats. Taking a cue, a national Hindi news channel of India declared Rahul as the Obama of India.

Rahul had gone out on this bicycle ride in the morning yesterday, and by the evening people were convinced that he had all the capabilities of leading India. It was established beyond doubt that he inspired confidence and hope among the common citizens of India.

“At a time when people in Delhi were scared to venture out on roads due to open manholes and drains, Congress leader has inspired confidence and dispelled these fears among the citizens. These are the kind of leaders India needs today. I am full of hope. Even companies like Avon and Hero have expressed hope that the incident would push up sales of their products.” Pramod Sharma, a leading journalist said.

But detractors of Rahul Gandhi didn’t miss even this opportunity to malign him. Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh claimed that whatever Rahul did was not new as Mulayam Singh Yadav had been riding bicycle for ages. For once, even Mayawati seemed to take the same line as Samajwadi Party leaders and accused Rahul Gandhi of creating ‘nuisance’.

“Yuvraaj of Congress was not wearing any helmet even though he rode a racing cycle on a busy Delhi road. There were no knee caps as well. It’s his habit to ignore security measures as he has been doing the same all through his trips in the UP villages. I hope that the Delhi traffic police, if they are not anti-dalit, send him a challan for this behavior.” Mayawati said.

Congress has trashed all such claims and accused the rival parties of being jealous of the rising popularity of Rahul Gandhi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/rahulg-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/fucking-awesome-rahul-gandhi-rides-a-bicycle-on-delhi-roads-317,Fucking awesome!

http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalitha-refuses-honorary-degree-in-kalaignar-thoughts-309,"Chennai. AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha has expressed deepest anguish and anger after Madras University decided to grant her honorary degree in the postgraduate course in Kalaignar Thoughts. The recently announced course is aimed at making people aware of thoughts and beliefs of DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi, who is also called Kalaignar by his supporters and happens to be the bete noir of Jayalalitha.

While AIADMK thinkers workers have criticized the university for stooping so low to be in the good books of the ruling party, G Thiruvasagam, the new vice-chancellor of Madras University, has justified the move as he claimed that the act will bring international recognition to the university and to the state.

An angry Jayalalitha refused the degree in Kalaignar Thoughts

“University of Madras would get listed in Guinness Book of World Records for awarding a degree in the shortest time ever for any course. It’s been just three days since we announced the introduction of the course and now we will have a student graduating with the degree even without a single class being held. No other university in the world can match us and beat us.” Thiruvasagam claimed.

Expectedly, Jayalalitha went livid at being called a student and that too of a course in Kalaignar Thoughts. She refused the degree straightaway and trashed the claims of the vice-chancellor while accusing the DMK government of bringing disrepute to the state by making false claims in the field of education.

“Earlier people from Periyar University had claimed to have discovered dinosaur eggs, which is now being termed as mere rocks by some experts. Now Madras University claims to have discovered a postgraduate degree in Kalaignar Thoughts, which surely would turn out to be lessons in kindergarten rhymes. If the university wants to award a real degree, they should start a Ph.D. in Amma Thoughts.” Jayalalitha suggested.

Our sources confirm that many academicians, after taking cue from the AIADMK chief’s statement, have already started work on course design for Ph.D. in Amma Thoughts in case AIADMK combine wins the next assembly polls.

Meanwhile, in an unrelated development, students from Tamil Nadu have been frantically trying various permutations and combinations of keywords like “job prospects” “expected salary” “campus placements” etc. on Google search ever since the announcement of new courses in Kalaignar Thoughts, Periyar Thoughts and Anna (not Amma) Thoughts was made by the University of Madras.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/amma-200x249.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/jayalalitha-refuses-honorary-degree-in-kalaignar-thoughts-309,Jayalalitha refuses honorary degree in Kalaignar Thoughts,,1255847417.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-border-with-china-to-be-fenced-with-nimbu-mirchi-294,"New Delhi. After expressing regret, disappointment, and heartbreak over China’s objection, outrage, and warning on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, India has finally decided to secure its border with China by fencing it with nimbu-mirchi (lemon and chili).

Nimbu-mirchi is a popular and reliable tool among Indians for warding off evil forces from attacking them. The decision has drawn mixed reactions from various quarters.

“I don’t believe in black magic. I see it as a security step while you call it superstition. Just like I go to a poor man’s house and you call it a dalit’s house,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi justified the move of the government, saying it was a befitting reply to the nonsensical uttering of China.

Such tools will be deployed along the border with China to protect us from the enemy

BJP has surprisingly welcomed the decision as it believes that the step will secure the Indian territory from the evil eyes of the Chinese, but has criticized the government of doing ‘too little too late’.

The party has demanded that black worn out shoes should also be hung from the barbed wires along with a board with the message “buri nazar wale tera munh kala” (o ye man with the evil eyes, let your face be black) written in Chinese on it. But Congress has rejected the suggestion saying it can jeopardize India’s relationship with the African countries.

Defense experts have by and large welcomed the step calling it a welcome change from the usual ‘appeasement policy’ followed by India in the bilateral relations, but have cautioned that China could very well ‘misuse’ and ‘misappropriate’ the tools employed by India.

“We must make sure that they don’t run away with the lemon and chilies to make hakka noodles or chili chicken. We have intelligence reports that Chinese are actually looking forward to the fencing of the border and ready to replace our lemon and chilies with Chinese ones, which are of quite inferior quality and may not work as intended,” Vishnu Bellani, a defense expert cautioned.

Meanwhile China has again expressed deep anguish and objection over these reports and has accused India of fomenting trouble along with the disputed borders by indulging in such acts. China has especially warned of dire consequences if Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was used for fencing the borders. It should be noted that Dalai Lama resides in Dharamsala, which is very near to Shimla in the hitherto undisputed Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

Common citizens of India have expressed hope over the development and are praying that peace prevails in the region, but they also fear that there could be a scam in the mass sourcing of the lemons and chilies in coming days, pushing the prices of goods, especially the food prices, further up. Many people have already started hoarding nimbu-mirchi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nimbu-250x176.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/indian-border-with-china-to-be-fenced-with-nimbu-mirchi-294,Indian border with China to be fenced with Nimbu-Mirchi,,1255505892.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/raj-thackeray-apologizes-after-accidentally-threatening-and-abusing-himself-286,"Mumbai. In the first ever instance of its kind where he has apologized for something he said or did, MNS chief Raj Thackeray has expressed deepest regrets after he accidentally threatened and abused himself during an election rally. His party MNS has termed the incident as a momentary lapse of memory by Raj Thackeray in the heat of the moment, and has accused the media of giving undue importance to a small incident.

The incident happened in Pune where Raj Thackeray was addressing an election rally. Raj brokered the issue of outsiders vs. insiders again and swore that no one would be allowed to exhibit and flaunt their own culture and language on the Marathi soil. He declared that if MNS came to power, all the cultural events and other public activities would be tracked and tallied, and it would be made sure that 91.7% of all such events were by the Marathi Manoos, for the Marathi Manoos and of the Marathi Manoos.

Raj Thackeray addressing the rally where he almost abused and threatened himself

“Marathi art and culture must be respected and promoted. We are culturally rich and don’t need ugly Hindi movies and music to entertain ourselves. We don’t even need those vulgar English songs and dances. No bastard will be allowed to invite weird characters like Michael Jackson on Marathi soil and make a dirty display of foreign culture. We will cut the arms of such persons and throw them into the Arabian Sea.” Raj roared as his supporters clapped over the arrival of the new cultural policy.

But little did Raj and his supporters realize at that time that MNS chief had almost just threatened and abused himself. Michael Jackson’s concert in Mumbai was organized by Shiv Udyog Sena in 1996, and it was none other than Raj Thackeray, then a member of Shiv Sena, who had formed Shiv Udyog Sena. So did Raj Thackeray just call himself bastard and threatened to cut his own hands?

Such deep insulting insinuations towards their respected leader made the MNS workers go wild with rage. They avowed to avenge the insult and set out to bash up the person who had insulted Raj Thackeray, even if it happened to be Raj Thackeray himself in this bizarre case.

“MNS workers are like Salman Khan in Wanted, who had said – ek baar jo maine commitment kardi, uske baad toh main khud ki bhi nahi sunta (if I get into a commitment, I won’t even listen to myself to break it) – the same way, once the MNS workers decide to bash up someone for insulting Raj Thackeray or Marathi Manoos, no power on earth can stop them from carrying out the act.” an MNS leader told on conditions of anonymity.

Fearing getting bashed up by the MNS workers, Raj Thackeray decided to apologize for his remarks, and termed it as a ‘creative mistake’. Raj is also a cartoonist like his uncle Balasaheb Thackeray and considers himself a creative person.

“Creative people are bound to commit mistakes. A few days back Karan Johar had made a mistake, now I happened to do it. It’s a small incident misinterpreted and blown up by the Hindi media. But still I apologize to my workers and to the people of Maharashtra if they are hurt.” Raj clarified, after which MNS workers decided to forgive him and forget the incident.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/raj-249x188.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/raj-thackeray-apologizes-after-accidentally-threatening-and-abusing-himself-286,Raj Thackeray apologizes after accidentally threatening and abusing himself,,1255325435.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-falls-in-borewell-while-campaigning-for-elections-278,"Hisar. While campaigning for Assembly Elections, a politician fell in a borewell here and has got stuck in the well since then. Rescue team and police have reached the spot and attempts are on to pull out the politician identified as Teznayan Bhadana, an independent candidate secretly backed by Congress. Thirteen hours and thirty nine minutes had passed since Mr. Bhadana fell in the borewell and he was still stuck there when reports last came in.

Rescue officer Mr. Bachao Singh Bishnoi informed us that Mr. Bhadana was still alive as people could hear his speeches coming out of the borewell. It was not clear what Mr. Bhadana was trying to convey through his speeches from inside the well due to the echo effect, but it is believed that he was crying for help and accusing a political conspiracy behind keeping the borewell open.

According to eye-witnesses, Teznayan Bhadana had seen a little kid playing near borewell and had started running towards the kid immediately, but fell in the borewell that was left uncovered. While supporters of Mr. Bhadana claim that he ran to save the kid as he feared him falling in the borewell, his political opponents say that Bhadana was on his way to perform his usual gimmick of lifting a kid in his arms to be popular among the locals. Police had no opinion or knowledge on how Mr. Bhadana fell in the borewell.

Rescue operatations are on for Mr. Bhadana

Mr. Bhadana had gone to campaign in the area where government has been digging a borewell for the last five years, apparently to provide water to the locals as the farmers have been long complaining about problems of irrigation. According to government sources, the borewell would have been completed today had Mr. Bhadana not fallen inside. They fear that now the water level could go down after this incident. When Faking News asked for the basis for such fears, they refused to divulge the details.

Meanwhile a parallel borewell was being dug to reach out to Mr. Bhadana and pull him out. It was rather surprising to us to notice that the same machines and people could dig a parallel borewell so fast while they took almost five years to dig the original one. Faking News also fears that the whole attempt could go waste as the radius of the parallel borewell was smaller than radius of Mr. Bhadana’s potbelly and he could again get stuck while being pulled out.

Amidst all this, politics has got heated in Haryana over the incident. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala suspects that Congress was behind the incident and that Mr. Bhadana was paid huge sum of money to fall in the well. Mr. Chautala suspected foul play as he refused to believe that a grown up person could fall in a borewell when a little kid was playing safely in the same area.

“Mr. Bhadana is acting to create a sympathy wave in the state in favor of the ruling party. It’s also an attempt to grad media headlines. News Channels are known to telecast such events live and now the Congress government will put up posters and hoardings at those places so that the same get transmitted on the television channels, and they won’t even have to pay for this free publicity.” Mr. Chautala warned that borewell politics won’t succeed in Haryana.

Congress has vehemently denied these allegations and has accused INLD and BJP of doing nothing for locals, who are truly represented by Mr. Bhadana. Congress workers and supporters of Mr. Bhadana are in turn accusing INLD and BJP of trapping genuine leaders like Mr. Bhadana. They claimed that the land, where borewell was being dug, belonged to a BJP supporter, who has been absconding since Mr. Bhadana fell inside. Mr. Bhadana’s supporters have threatened to launch ‘rail todo’ agitation if he is not pulled out within next nine hours.

Away from politics, Faking News asks its readers to send ‘get well soon’ messages to 6969 and pray with us for Mr. Bhadana’s survival.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/BorewellFall-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/politician-falls-in-borewell-while-campaigning-for-elections-278,Politician falls in borewell while campaigning for elections,,1255074078.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-fasting-for-their-political-leaders-on-karwa-chauth-face-hostility-269,"Hyderabad. Gay supporters of various political leaders faced hostility from their straight counterparts when they decided to fast today to wish long lives to their respective leaders. Today is the festival of Karwa Chauth, when seemingly faithful wives and apparently committed girlfriends fast the whole day to insure longevity to their maybe adulterous husbands or possibly two-timing boyfriends. This mode of public display of love and loyalty by gays has not gone down well with many people it seems.

A gay supporter of YSR’s son YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was beaten up when he applied Mehendi all over his body as a mark of love and loyalty towards his leader. He declared that he’d break his fast only after Jagan came up to him in the night and offered him food, apart from allowing him (the gay guy) to see him (Jagan Reddy) through a sieve. Straight supporters of Jagan thought that this act of the gay supporter suggested that Jagan was his gay partner, and hence a gay too.

The gay supporter of Jagan, who was bashed up for his love

“This is outrageous and nonsensical, we don’t approve of such gay gimmicks. If he really loved our leader he should have fasted until death unless Jagan Reddy was made the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is just a publicity hungry mongrel and we taught him a lesson.” one of the straight supporters of Jagan Reddy, who bashed up the gay supporter, said.

Similar gay supporters were beaten up in Ahmedabad who fasted for Narendra Modi, and in Mumbai who fasted for leaders like Thackerays and Sharad Pawar. The straight supporters were livid with these acts of gays as all of them deemed it disrespectful to their leaders. All of them averred that none of their leaders were gay, and hence they deserved straight display of affection.

But gay rights activists and liberal people have decried these gay bashings and have requested various political leaders and the civil society to allow the gays to express their love the way they wanted.

“This is illogical. If gay supporters’ ways makes the leaders gay, the straight supporters’ ways should make them criminal, rapists and arsonists. But none of these supporters objected when some straight supporters destroyed property and killed people to express their love and support to the respective leaders. The civil society must support the gays.” Ahmed Anju Iyer, the founder-president of Bhartiya Samlaingik Party (BSP) said.

BSP, the political party of people with alternative sexual preferences, has threatened to launch an agitation against such discrimination and violence against gays and has demanded that the next census should also record the sexual preferences of people in India so that the true strength of gays, lesbians, transsexuals and bisexuals could be known for sure, enabling them to influence policy decisions of the government and the society.

Common citizens of India have been apathetic to the whole issue, but many of them wondered why only gays were active on Karwa Chauth while none of the lesbians were fasting for their women leaders like Mamta Banerjee, Kumari Mayawati or Sonia Gandhi.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/gay-250x195.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-fasting-for-their-political-leaders-on-karwa-chauth-face-hostility-269,Gays fasting for their political leaders on Karwa Chauth face hostility,,1254902852.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,

In a decision that could generate long lasting impact and controversy, the UPA government today declared Bihar as a part of Maharashtra and decided to call it North Maharashtra. This means that the state assemblies of erstwhile Bihar and Maharashtra will be merged and fresh elections will be ordered in the Greater Maharashtra. The new government will have all its offices and officials stationed in the existing city of Mumbai.

The decision has caused a widespread confusion and outrage among people as nobody is quite sure about the fallout of the merger of the two states. Biharis are furious as technically their state has been merged into Maharashtra, which means their independent identity will be lost. All Biharis hereafter will become Marathis, something that riles people of Maharashtra as well, especially the supporters of MNS led by Raj Thackeray.

“No bhaiyya is even a manoos, forget Marathi Manoos. This is an insult to Maharashtra by Congress and our party will take every possible step to prevent this merger. This is also a conspiracy by bhaiyyas to gain political control over Mumbai. If the government doesn’t take back its decision, we’ll whack all the bhaiyaa bhelpuri-vendors and taxi-drivers.” an MNS leader warned.

Once upon a time states in India were organized like this

The intellectuals among the MNS are planning to apply for a Geographical Indication (GI) patent for the term “Marathi Manoos” so that it becomes illegal for people residing outside the current political Maharashtra to call themselves Marathi Manoos. But they have already hit a roadblock because if the GI patent was granted, the current bhaiyya bhelpuri-vendors and taxi-drivers, apart from the other outsiders living in Mumbai, will also become Marathi Manoos, and the local Marathis may start empathizing with them, which could prove suicidal for their party.

On the other hand, political parties in Bihar have threatened to burn trains and smash all public offices if Bihar was wiped off the political map of India. Political pundits feel that it’s a conspiracy by Congress to gain some political power in a state they were completely wiped off and were forced to piggyback on parties like RJD and LJSP. RJD chief Lalu Yadav has threatened to dump Congress if the UPA government went ahead with the decision.

“Why should we be called North Maharashtra? If a merger is so essential, let Maharashtra be called South Bihar. There was no Maharashtra when India became independent, but there was a bigger Bihar. Bihar has always missed its mineral-rich southern part since Jharkhand was carved out, so it makes sense to add a richer southern part to our poor state, but it’s completely nonsense to call Bihar as North Maharashtra.” Lalu Yadav argued.

The government has claimed that the decision was a part of the ‘inclusive growth’ exercise and they will take further such decisions in futures, such as merging Cricket and Kabaddi. Experts believe that the decision of the government is ‘perplexing’, but they don’t think that the idea was abnormal or unusual.

“Most of the states and nations were created the same way. Political boundaries were drawn first and then some justification was proposed. With a new research suggesting that Aryan Dravidian theory could be a myth, lingual divide too seems to be phony. Anyway, the languages that some Biharis, such as Maithilis, speak hardly even resemble Hindi, so they might as well be called dialects of Marathi. Similarly not everyone in current Maharashtra speaks Marathi. So it’s not a big deal really.” Arindam Anand, a leading linguist said.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/india_1947-250x248.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/anger-and-confusion-reigns-as-bihar-declared-a-part-of-maharashtra-267,Anger and confusion reigns as Bihar declared a part of Maharashtra,,1254834949.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/most-politicians-stand-for-elections-just-because-they-have-piles-259,"Aligarh. In a rather bizarre discovery, an NGO has found out that most politicians of India stand for elections just because they have piles (bawaseer in Hindi) and they find it painful to sit at one place. The finding was made public by a volunteer of the NGO during a press conference here today, although the NGO has accused the volunteer of misrepresenting and misinterpreting the facts.

“I felt that Rearing Democracy (name of the concerned NGO) was being bribed or intimidated by the big political parties and feared that these important findings could be buried by them, hence I have decided to call this press conference. And I am sure that most of you would be shocked to know that most of our politicians suffer from bawaseer (piles) and that’s why they keep on standing for elections and roam here and there. We have long misunderstood their movements as being social service, while in reality they are doing a service to their own bowel movements. This is shocking and an eye-opening fact that the citizens of India must know.” Maasoom Singh, the volunteer, shocked everyone present in the press conference by his claims.

Hakim Faiyaz Alam Islahi, one of the favorites to treat piles of politicians

The medical class of India has expressed shock over the findings, while various hakeems have come out with open offers of free treatment to the leaders in exchange for photos clicked with them.

But the political class of Indian seems to be too upset and has called Maasoom a mentally deranged person and has threatened to file a defamation suit against him if he didn’t drop his claims immediately. Leaders cutting across party lines have claimed that their clan was genuinely moved by people’s problems and their actions were controlled by their heart and minds, and not by assholes.

“This is such an absurd claim made by a person who is on a mission to murder democracy in India. We want to remind our citizens that no political leader had supported an IAS officer who was getting his piles treated in his office. If we too had been suffering from piles, hadn’t we showed some compassion for that officer as is generally seen in the cases of corruption? We want to reassure our citizens that their leaders are having no problems sitting or shitting.” a candidate standing for the Haryana Assembly Elections said.

But Maasoom is standing his ground and has asked the NGO Rearing Democracy to make their report public, which he claims specifically mentions that Indian leaders were suffering from piles. The NGO officials have gone underground for the moment as they fear retaliatory attacks from the supporters of various political parties, though they maintain that there has been a widespread confusion.

“Yes, the Executive Summary of our report did mention about piles, but it was an abbreviation. Our report claimed that most Indian leaders seem to be suffering from PILES disorder, but PILES stood for Physical, Intellectual, Lingual, Emotional, Social (and Spiritual) Development. Maasoom, being an MBA grad, didn’t care to read the whole report and made his conclusions based upon the Executive Summary only and jumped the gun. Now no one is ready to listen to our explanation as the disease piles has become the center of the controversy.” Akhil Akela, the head of Rearing Democracy expressed his frustration.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hakeem.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/most-politicians-stand-for-elections-just-because-they-have-piles-259,Most politicians stand for elections just because they have piles,,1254724207.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-does-a-rahul-spends-night-with-a-brahmin-family-210,"Chitrakoot. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and firebrand dalit leader Kumari Mayawati spent last night with a poor Brahmin family in Tilakpur village. She spent around eighteen hours with the family of Tulsi Tripathi, a poor Brahmin, starting from 5 PM on Friday to 11 AM on Saturday. She also took dinner, which was prepared without onions and garlic, and breakfast, prepared with goat milk and Texmati rice, with the family, before she decided to leave for Lucknow. The visit was a part of Chief Minister’s attempt to find out the real issues and problems of her people, a government press release told.

“It was a dream come true for us. Finally we can hope that something good can happen to us. Behenji promised that our children will get reservations in jobs. She also told that she will deliver a speech in the parliament informing the world how poorer we are becoming with each passing day. Only yesterday someone stole my goat.” Tulsi Tripathi told mediapersons.

Mayawati reaffirmed Tulsi of her support and accused Congress and Samajwadi Party supporters of creating law and order problems by stealing goats and looting Brahmins during her term. She accused other parties of showing no respect to Brahmins during their respective tenures and of exploiting them to their political benefits.

Behenji being felicitated by Brahmins

“What have these poor Brahmins got in return after supporting almost all political parties who got to power? They have neither respect nor rupees today. Their richer cousins are enjoying life in USA and dancing with Obama, and funding enemies of BSP with millions of dollars. These are my people, they are dalit Brahmins, the real harijans, the people of god.” Mayawati addressed hordes of Brahmins who clapped and pledged their support to her during elections.

Mayawati also performed a puja with the Brahmin family, where she took the role of the Goddess. After the puja, Mayawati inquired if the local Brahmins could write a Behenji Chalisa, to which the locals readily agreed.

The move is seen as Mayawati’s continuous attempt to consolidate support among the forward castes, especially Brahmins, to checkmate Congress’ attempts of wooing dalits and Samajwadi Party’s attempts to unite all backward castes. Experts believe that with this step, Mayawati has also given an answer to Congress, which has been projecting Rahul Gandhi as the original traveler and discoverer of rural India.

Expectedly, opposition parties in the state have decried Mayawati for adopting such ‘cheap’ tactics. Samajwadi Party has cautioned Brahmins against supporting BSP, claiming it to be a suicidal step for the community. The party has promised to replace all stolen goats of Brahmins with cows if they came to power.

Congress too has cautioned Brahmins and asked them to stick to their original party. The party also claimed that Mayawati had insulted Brahmins as she took bath with a special soap after coming back to Lucknow from the Brahmin colony. Congress has asked Mayawati to apologize to the Brahmin community for her humiliating acts.

When asked about this incident, Mayawati’s office refuted the charges vigorously and accused Congress of spreading rumors to create disharmony in the state. Her secretary informed that Mayawati always took bath with special soaps, for which ninety three lakh rupees were budgeted last year, and her bathing was a regular job and in no way related to her stay at a Brahmin’s house.

Furious by these allegations, Mayawati also fired fresh allegations against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of using a body-double while moving in trains as part of austerity drive. She also claimed that it was a duplicate of Rahul Gandhi who spent a night with a dalit family recently.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mayawati-250x187.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/mayawati-does-a-rahul-spends-night-with-a-brahmin-family-210,"Mayawati does a Rahul, spends night with a Brahmin family",,1253945237.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-form-their-own-political-party-to-fight-assembly-elections-182,"Bengaluru. Encouraged by the fact that the central government didn’t ask for stay on Delhi High Court’s order on section 377 legalizing gay sex, gays have announced formation of Bhartiya Samlaingik Party (BSP), a political party representing people with alternative sexualities especially gays, lesbians, transsexuals and bisexuals. The new party will contest the coming assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh and will put up candidates on all the seats.

“BSP candidates would not necessarily be homosexuals, but we’d prefer and encourage homosexuals to come out in open and fight elections.” founding president of the BSP Ahmed Anju Iyer told a jampacked press conference, clarifying that the president of BSP would always be a gay though.

BSP declared three central issues around which its political campaign will revolve – Abrogation of Section 377 of Indian Penile Penal Code, Formation of a Homosexual Personal Law, and Building a grand mall/multiplex in Bengaluru for central activities of homosexuals in India that will be called Golmall (Gays Or Lesbians Mall).

Mr. Iyer, accompanies by gay rights activists, argued that time was ripe for gays and other groups to form a pressure group by entering politics. He warned that homosexuals would no longer tolerate victimization of their community and disrespect shown to their beliefs. He claimed that homosexuals were the most discriminated against minority group in India.

Time for a new beginning

“Gays are shown as funny people in Bollywood movies and gay jokes go unchecked on internet. Till recently, we used to tolerate such stuff but then we realized that in India people take you seriously only when you show pigheaded intolerance. We can’t change ourselves overnight but now we have learnt to stand up for our rights. And the results have been encouraging. Last year, this government had filed an affidavit in court arguing that we were a social vice and possessed pervert minds! Now the same government is wary of rubbing us the wrong way. BSP will make sure that no government in future tries to rub us the wrong way.” Mr. Iyer explained the political agenda.

Mr. Iyer cautioned that if victimization and criminal branding of homosexuals didn’t stop, some of them might be even forced to become terrorists. He informed that he has come to know of a group that has been formed to present the militant face of homosexuality. The group is called Homosexual Initiative for Militancy in India (HIMI). When journalists asked whether he was getting into unlawful activities through HIMI and talks of terrorism, Mr. Iyer refuted these charges as baseless.

“HIMI is not directly associated with us and we don’t know who the members of HIMI are. It might well be a conspiracy to defame homosexuals, we don’t know. But threat of terrorism looms large. I just want to caution our fellow citizens that a victimized minority group usually takes the path of terrorism and some of us may go that way.” Mr. Iyer expressed his concerns.

Mr. Iyer was candid enough to admit that absence of a common religion among homosexuals was the main reason why Indian homosexuals have not been able to form a pressure group or carry terrorist attacks till now. He claimed that the recent initiatives by Church in West to have special churches for homosexuals were attempts to convert homosexuals and weaken their attempts to form a pressure group.

The manifesto and constitution of BSP will be released next week and currently the thrust will be to induct new members. The party has not ruled out any seat sharing arrangement or post-poll alliance with another political party if it furthers the interests of gays and lesbians.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/gay_party-250x166.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/gays-form-their-own-political-party-to-fight-assembly-elections-182,"Gays form their own political party, to fight assembly elections",,1253215271.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tharoor-clarifies-cattle-class-remark-blames-jackasses-for-confusion-180,"New Delhi. In an exclusive chat with Faking News before leaving for Ghana and Liberia, two of the most poorest counties of the world where he would have no choice but to live in austerity, Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor clarified his ‘cattle class’ remark, claiming that he didn’t use it to disrespect the aam aadmi (common man) of India. Tharoor blamed “jackasses” among Indian media and political class for misinterpreting and misrepresenting his tweet.

Following are the excerpts from the exclusive interview, which incidentally is the first ever interview of a human being by Faking News. Earlier we had interviewed two pigeons (Masakali of Delhi-6 and an aam kabootar of Mumbai) and one monkey (Monkeyman of Delhi). The interview was conducted in Mr. Tharoor’s car and lasted around couple of hours as his car got stuck in a traffic jam near Dhaula Kuaan on way to Indira Gandhi International Airport.

Faking News (FN): Thanks for letting us in your car Mr. Tharoor, we never saw such a luxurious car. Are you using tax payers’ money for this?

Shashi Tharoor (ST): (exhaustedly) yeah, I use taxpayer’s money to buy my diamond studded underwear too. Happy? Jackasses (murmurs)! People like you create all such confusion by assuming anything and everything.

FN: I’m sorry sir, but we never published any story about your comment or your lavish lifestyle. We are a news organization with a difference. We are in fact here to clear the confusion, instead of creating one. Do you want us to continue with the interview?

ST: hmmm… well, I’d take that on face value. Anyway, this traffic is hardly moving and I can’t even access my Twitter account on my iPhone. I have written to the Telecom Ministry to allot 3G spectrum as soon as possible, but we take so much time in taking any decision. I’m anyways bored so let’s continue.

FN: Thanks minister. So let’s start with the latest controversy, you apparently insulted the common man of India by calling them holy cows traveling in cattle class.

Shashi Tharoor in happier times

ST: That’s bullshit. First of all common man hardly travels by air, let alone business class or economy class. I’m surprised the way our media and political class defines aam aadmi. You guys can’t think beyond the middle and upper middle classes. Even if ‘cattle class’ is deemed as a hurtful term, it hardly hurts the aam aadmi, who actually rides cattle in the villages.

FN: So it’s alright to hurt the sentiments of middle classes?

ST: That’s your interpretation. I’d not clarify each and every thing that you go on to assume. I have seen many Indians playing FarmVille on facebook and they love to raise cattle and proudly publish the same on their walls. I guess the Indian middle class doesn’t find it hurtful to be saddled with cattle.

FN: What about ‘holy cows’?

ST: I don’t know how is that a hurtful term! Being called a cow has never been deemed as insulting in our country. The term ‘cow belt’ has been used for ages to define Hindi speaking areas, no one ever objected to it. Whoever is making such interpretations!

FN: Our Managing Editor Pagal Patrakar thinks that you used the term ‘holy cows’ for the Congress leaders who are on austerity drive, and you meant to say that you’d travel, rather unwillingly, by economy class to show solidarity with likes of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Is that true?

ST: Again, that’s your interpretation. In fact a Pagal’s interpretation. No comments.

FN: But what’s your take on austerity drive?

ST: It’s a nice idea.

FN: Apparently you didn’t like it, especially when you were told to vacate a five-star suite, expenses of which were being paid from your personal accounts as you claim?

ST: Okay, since you claim to be a news organization with a difference, let me tell you something. Dude, I feel this is going too far. Tomorrow they’d ask me to wear Rupa’s briefs and vests even though I like Versace. My lifestyle is my personal matter. There are people who fake personal travel as official one and then claim austerity by traveling in cattle class. That’s not austerity, that’s corruption!

FN: But shouldn’t you lead an exemplary life as a central minister?

ST: By wearing Rupa’s underwears? What kind of message would that send, if at all any? That even if one can afford a better lifestyle, one should not spend money? If I spend from my own pocket, I am actually doing good to our economy in these adverse conditions by increasing circulation of money in the market. Is that so difficult to understand?

FN: So you don’t like austerity at all? You believe in ‘if you have it, flaunt it’?

ST: Another of your interpretations. And who told you that I am not austere? When everyone, including Advani, took to blogging, I took to micro-blogging (twitter). Isn’t that austerity? I use so few words to express myself. I save hundreds of words each time I tweet.

FN: That’s an interesting point you make minister, but people are already baying for your blood. Media reports suggest that your party can take disciplinary action against you for your ‘cattle class’ remark. And now after we publish your interview, you might be expelled from the party!

ST: (sighs) That’d be really sad.

Faking News: Thanks for your time minister. We wish you all the best and a happy journey.

Shashi Tharoor: My pleasure. I might like to tweet about you sometime.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tharoor-201x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/tharoor-clarifies-cattle-class-remark-blames-jackasses-for-confusion-180,"Tharoor clarifies ""cattle class"" remark, blames jackasses for confusion",,1253178180.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-inadvertently-submits-proof-of-low-cost-tour-to-us-officials-163,"Washington, D.C., USA. Home Minister P Chidambaram, who was on a four-day visit to USA to learn lessons in domestic security and international relations from US authorities, seemed to have accidentally submitted all the invoices, vouchers and bills of his visit in the office of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Chidambaram was supposed to submit those details to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in order to prove his austerity as a cabinet minister belonging to Congress.

P Chidambaram with Hillary Clinton after submission

“Home Minister was too busy meeting US officials and submitting documents to them to prove various stuffs like involvement of Pakistan in terror activities and steps taken by India to ensure safety of US citizens visiting India. Various other US departments too sought proofs and documents from him on issues like Nuclear Deal and rights of religious minorities in India. Mr. Chidambaram had gone into an almost autopilot mode of submitting documents and proofs, and in the same mode he happened to submit even the documents related to his low cost travel to US authorities.” an official who accompanied P Chidambaram on his US visit said.

Even though the documents were submitted inadvertently, the US authorities seem to have taken it quite seriously, as they have forwarded Chidambaram’s voucher and bills to the FBI for further investigations. This has caused a bizarre situation to arise as government of India has now realized that such steps by the USA amounts to interference in India’s domestic affairs and sovereignty. External Ministry of India has asked the US authorities to return Chidambaram’s invoices and stop the investigations, if possible.

“@hillaryclinton:It’s not cool, please return Chidambaram’s bills Hillary. God bless America.” read the latest tweet from Shashi Tharoor, Minister of State of External Affairs, who is also slated to submit bills of his stay in five-star suites to the Finance Ministry.

Sources inform Faking News that US authorities may drop the FBI investigations into the invoices and bills of P Chidambaram if the home ministry of India wrote a formal application, duly signed by the Home Minister and attested by the Prime Minister, and submitted it in person in the office of US President by Monday 10.00 AM EST. American ambassador to India has conveyed the same to the officials in home ministry, who have apparently warmed to the ‘suggestion’.",,http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/indo-us-250x250.jpg,,,http://www.fakingnews.com/politics/chidambaram-inadvertently-submits-proof-of-low-cost-tour-to-us-officials-163,Chidambaram inadvertently submits proof of low cost tour to US officials,,1252702340.0,http://www.fakingnews.com,
